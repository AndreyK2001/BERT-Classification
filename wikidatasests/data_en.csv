"Hussain Muhammad Ershad (1930–2019) was a Bangladeshi military officer and politician who played a prominent role in the country's political landscape. He served as the Chief of Army Staff of the Bangladesh Army and later became the President of Bangladesh, holding office from 1983 to 1990. Ershad was a key figure in shaping the political trajectory of Bangladesh during the 1980s. Hussain Muhammad Ershad was born on February 1, 1930, in the Cooch Behar district of British India (present-day Bangladesh). He joined the Pakistan Military Academy and was commissioned into the Pakistan Army in 1952. Ershad rose through the ranks, eventually becoming the Chief of Army Staff of the Bangladesh Army in 1978. In 1982, Ershad seized power in a bloodless coup, overthrowing the elected government of President A. F. M. Ahsanuddin Chowdhury. He assumed the presidency in 1983 and continued in office until his resignation in 1990. A mix of economic reforms and political repression marked Ershad's presidency. He initiated the introduction of a market-oriented economy, but his regime faced criticism for human rights abuses and curtailment of political freedoms. Ershad sought to consolidate power through political reforms, establishing the Jatiya Party (National Party) in 1986 as a vehicle for his political ambitions. He implemented policies to modernise the country's infrastructure, education, and economy during his presidency. Facing widespread protests and opposition, particularly from the youth and political activists, Ershad's regime came under increasing pressure in the late 1980s. The pro-democracy movement gained momentum, culminating in mass protests and strikes. In the face of mounting pressure, Ershad resigned from the presidency on December 6, 1990, ushering in a new era of multiparty democracy in Bangladesh. After his resignation, Ershad faced legal challenges and spent time in and out of custody. Despite his controversial legacy, he remained involved in Bangladeshi politics. Ershad served as the President of the Jatiya Party and was elected as a Member of Parliament multiple times. Hussain Muhammad Ershad passed away on July 14, 2019, at 89. His death marked the end of an era in Bangladeshi politics, leaving a complex legacy that continues to be a subject of debate and discussion.",Easy

"Bengali literature refers to the literary works produced in the Bengali language, primarily in the eastern regions of the Indian subcontinent, including Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. It boasts a rich heritage dating back to the 10th century and has played a pivotal role in shaping the cultural and intellectual landscape of the region. Bengali literature encompasses diverse genres, styles, and themes, reflecting the dynamic history and cultural evolution of the Bengali-speaking people. Early Period: The earliest known literary work in Bengali is the ""Charyapada,"" a collection of mystical poems dating back to the 10th century. It marked the beginning of Bengali literature, blending elements of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Tantric traditions. Medieval Period: The medieval period saw the emergence of narratives like the Mangalkavyas, devotional poetry dedicated to Hindu deities. The 15th-century poet Chandidas and the 16th-century poet Vidyapati made significant contributions to this genre. In the 19th century, known as the Bengal Renaissance, they witnessed a remarkable literary and cultural revival. Key figures like Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Michael Madhusudan Dutt played crucial roles in promoting social reforms and contributing to the literary scene. Michael Madhusudan Dutt: Often hailed as the pioneer of Bengali drama, Dutt's epic poem ""Meghnad Badh Kavya"" broke traditional norms and introduced blank verse in Bengali literature. Rabindranath Tagore, one of the most celebrated figures in Bengali literature, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913 for his collection of poems, ""Gitanjali."" Tagore's contributions extend beyond poetry to include plays, essays, and short stories, making him a towering figure in world literature. The post-independence era brought forth a new wave of Bengali literature, addressing contemporary issues and exploring diverse themes. Notable writers include Satyajit Ray, the filmmaker and author, and Sunil Gangopadhyay, known for his prolific output in various genres. Bengali Poetry: The tradition of poetry is deeply ingrained in Bengali literature, with diverse forms such as Chhanda, Ghazal, and Nazrulgeeti. Poets like Jibanananda Das and Kazi Nazrul Islam have left an indelible mark on Bengali poetry. Bengali Fiction: The Bengali novel has seen illustrious contributions from authors like Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Saratchandra Chattopadhyay, and Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay. Themes range from social realism to psychological explorations. Bengali Drama: The evolution of Bengali drama can be traced back to the works of Michael Madhusudan Dutt and Rabindranath Tagore. Modern playwrights like Badal Sircar and Manoj Mitra have added contemporary perspectives to the theatrical landscape. Bengali literature has profoundly influenced the broader spectrum of Indian literature. Writers like Saratchandra Chattopadhyay and Rabindranath Tagore have inspired authors in various Indian languages, contributing to a rich tapestry of literary traditions.",Easy
"Immigration is the process of people settling down in a region other than their region of origin, as seen from the point of view of the destination region. The same process is called emigration when seen from the point of view of the source region. When looking at the phenomenon from a global point of view, the word migration is used. This process is often considered at the level of countries and groups of people ('the immigration from Turkey to Austria', for example, or 'immigration is an opportunity for a country but it can also bring problems'). An immigrant is someone who lives in a country but came from another country. For example, if someone was born in France and goes to Germany to live there, he is an immigrant in Germany. He also left France, that means that the French see him as an emigrant. An immigrant really lives in the other country for a long time or forever. If you only visit a country for a short time, then you are for example a tourist.",Easy

"Florence Nightingale, (12 May 1820 – 13 August 1910), was an English nurse. She helped create the modern techniques of nursing. She became a leader of the team of nurses who helped wounded soldiers during the Crimean War. She was the first female to receive the Order of Merit, the highest honour awarded to a British person. As a nurse she was given the name 'The Lady with the Lamp' because at night, she checked on the wounded soldiers and always carried 'The Lamp' with her. She helped make modern nursing possible. Nightingale wrote a lot. She lived to be 90 years old. In her lifetime she was concerned with spreading medical knowledge. Some of her books were written in simple English so that they could easily be understood by those with poor reading skills. She also was an early user of graphs and diagrams to display data. Nightingale was helped to understand statistics by her country's leading expert on public statistics, William Farr. He was a founder of medical statistics, and epidemiology. Farr worked with her on all the statistics from the Crimean War, which she publicised in her writing. She proved that more men had died from disease than fighting, a very important piece of information. The disease in question was mostly cholera. Cholera is caused by a bacterium which is spread by people drinking water which is contaminated by sewage. Unfortunately, both she and Farr believed the disease was caused by foul air: this was called the miasma theory. The miasma theory was refuted by John Snow, who discovered the real cause of an outbreak in London. The cause was foul water from a water pump in Broad Street, London. Snow's work was published in 1855, but it was 30 years before the germ theory was generally accepted. Farr publicly acknowledged he was wrong in 1866, but Nightingale never really gave up the miasma idea. London's cholera epidemics stopped once the authorities built sewage treatment plants, delivered cleaner water, and built a system of underground pipes which kept sewage from seeping into the water supply. Florence Nightingale was born into an upper class British family in 1820 in Florence, Tuscany, Italy. She was named after the town where she was born. The family moved back to London when Florence was a young girl. She was a Unitarian. Although her parents expected her to become a wife and a mother, in 1845 she decided to become a nurse. While she was training she campaigned for better conditions for poor people in Britain. In 1854 when the Crimean War began, Florence was working in Harley Street in London. After reading many reports about the poor treatment of sick and injured soldiers, she travelled to Crimea to see for herself and discovered the hospitals were crowded and dirty. She knew Sidney Herbert, who was Secretary of War during the Crimean War and he helped her. At the hospital in Istanbul where the injured soldiers were sent, Florence realized that soldiers died more often from diseases like cholera than from their injuries in war. She used her knowledge of maths and statistics to show the British government that providing better conditions for sick and injured soldiers would help them win the war. She was, however, quite wrong about how cholera spread. There is a syndrome named after her called ""Florence Nightingale Syndrome"". It occurs when a soldier falls in love with a nurse. While she was working in Crimea she became known as “The Lady with the Lamp” because she would walk around the hospital in the evening carrying a lamp and check on the soldiers. When she returned to England she started a school in 1860 for nurses at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London. She wrote her most important book Notes on Nursing. She was a keen Christian but also believed that pagan and eastern religions also contained genuine worth. She was a strong opponent of discrimination against all types of Christians as well as against non-Christians. Nightingale believed religion helped provide people with the fortitude for arduous good work. In 1907, Florence Nightingale became the first woman to be awarded the Order of Merit by King Edward VII. Nightingale died in 1910 in London. There are many statues of her in Britain, including one in Waterloo Place in London and a Florence Nightingale museum, also in London.",Easy

"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Hindi: मोहनदास करमचन्द गांधी, Mohāndās Karamchand Gāndhī; Gujarati: મોહનદાસ કરમચંદ ગાંધી; 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was a leader of nationalism in British-ruled India. He is more commonly called Mahatma Gandhi; mahatma is an honorific meaning ""high-souled"" or ""venerable"" in Sanskrit. He was first called this in 1914 in South Africa. He is also called Bapu in India (Gujarati endearment for ""father"", ""papa""). He was the Martyr of the Nation since 1948. Rabindranath Tagore gave him this name. Gandhi was one of the most important people involved in the movement for the independence of India. He was a non-violent activist, who led the independence movement through a non-violent protest. Mohandas Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, Gujarat, India. Several members of his family worked for the government of the state. When Gandhi was 18 years old, he went to England to study law. After he became a lawyer, he went to the British colony of South Africa where he experienced laws that said people with dark skin had fewer rights than people with light skin. He decided then to become a political activist, so he could help change these unfair laws. He created a powerful, non-violent movement. During Gandhi's life, India was a colony of the United Kingdom, but wanted independence. In 1930, Gandhi led the Salt March. When he returned to India, he helped bring about the country's independence from British rule, inspiring other colonial people to work for their own independence, break up the British Empire, and replace it with the Commonwealth. People of many different religions and ethnic groups lived in British India. Many people thought that the country should break into separate countries so that different groups could have their own countries. In particular, many people thought that Hindus and Muslims should have separate countries. Gandhi was a Hindu, but he liked ideas from many religions including Islam, Judaism and Christianity, and he thought that people of all religions should have the same rights, and could live together peacefully in the same country. In 1938, Gandhi resigned from Congress. He said that he was no longer able to work through Congress to unite the divisions in caste and religion. He also felt that he had little to offer to the political process. In 1947, India became independent from the British Empire and formed two separate countries: India and Pakistan. Gandhi wanted independence, but did not want the split into two different countries. Instead of celebrating on independence day, he was mourning the division of India. Gandhi's principle of satyagraha, often translated as ""way of truth"" or ""pursuit of truth"", has inspired other democratic and anti-racist activists like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Nelson Mandela. Gandhi often said that his values were simple, based upon traditional Hindu beliefs: truth (satya), and non-violence (ahimsa). On January 30, 1948, Gandhi was assassinated by an extremist Hindu activist, Nathuram Godse, who was angry because he felt that Gandhi was too lenient towards Muslims. Godse was hanged as punishment for this.",Easy

"Common Era (CE) is commonly used in the Western World for the year number part of a date. The year numbers are the same as those used for Anno Domini (AD). In both systems the current year is 2024. The CE and AD systems both started with the year 1. Neither system uses a year zero (0). Common Era is abbreviated as CE, and is also known as Current Era and Christian Era. Before Common Era (BCE) is the system for the years Before the Common Era. BCE uses the same numbering as BC or Before Christ. ""CE"" and ""BCE"" are placed after the year number. Thus we read ""Right now our year is 2024 CE"" or ""Artaxerxes III of Persia was born in 425 BCE."" The year-numbering used in the Gregorian calendar is based on a 6th century estimate for the year Jesus was born. The use of Anno Domini (Latin for ""in year of theour Lord"") has been used with the Western calendar since about that time. The use of Before Christ and the abbreviations AD and BC came somewhat later.

The day is observed by the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Lutheran Church, and people of Irish descent around the world. Not much is known about St Patrick. He was born in Roman Britain to a wealthy family in the 5th century. Patrick was 16 years old when he was captured by Irish raiders and taken into Ireland. He escaped after six years of slavery, and returned to Britain. In later years, he went back to Ireland to teach and Christianize the Irish at great risk to his personal safety. He used a shamrock to teach the concept of the Trinity. Legend says he drove the snakes out of Ireland. St. Patrick died on 17 March. He is said to be buried at Down Cathedral in Downpatrick, County Down. In places where the day is observed, people attend mass, then turn the day over to celebrating and feasting. Most Irish people wear something green on the day like a tie, hair ribbon, or shamrock. The phrase ""the wearing of the green"" means to wear a shamrock on one's clothing. New York City, Boston, Dublin, and many other places have parades with a local celebrity (such as the police chief or mayor) acting as Grand Marshal.

"Muhi-ud-Din Muhammad (3 November 1618 – 3 March 1707), commonly known by the sobriquet Aurangzeb (Persian: ""Ornament of the Throne"") or by his regnal title Alamgir (Persian: ""Conqueror of the World""), was the sixth Mughal emperor, who ruled over almost the entire Indian subcontinent for a period of 49 years. Widely considered to be the last effective ruler of the Mughal Empire, Aurangzeb compiled the Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, and was among the few monarchs to have fully established Sharia law and Islamic economics throughout the Indian subcontinent. He was an accomplished military leader whose rule has been the subject of praise, though he has also been described as the most controversial ruler in Indian history. He was a notable expansionist; during his reign, the Mughal Empire reached its greatest extent, ruling over nearly all of the Indian subcontinent.During his lifetime, victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to 4million square kilometres,and he ruled over a population estimated to be over 158 million subjects,Under his reign, India surpassedQing Chinato become the world's largest economy and biggest manufacturing power, worth nearly a quarter ofglobal GDPand more than the entirety of Western Europe, and its largest and wealthiest subdivision, theBengal Subah,signaled theproto-industrialization. Aurangzeb was noted for his religious piety; hememorized the entire Quran, studiedhadithsand stringently observed the rituals of Islam.Unlike his predecessors, including his fatherShah Jahan, Aurangzeb considered the royal treasury to be held in trust for the citizens of his empire. He did not enjoy a luxurious life and his personal expenses and constructions of small mosques were covered by his own earnings, which included the sewing of caps and trade of his written copies of the Quran.He also patronized works ofIslamicandArabic calligraphy. Aurangzeb has been subject to criticism. Critics argue that his policies abandoned his predecessors' legacy of pluralism and religious tolerance, citing his introduction of thejizyatax and other policies based onIslamic ethics, demolition ofHindu temples, the executions of his elder brotherDara Shikoh,MarathakingSambhajiand the SikhGuru Tegh Bahadur,and the prohibition and supervision of behaviour and activities that areforbidden in Islamsuch as gambling, fornication, and consumption of alcohol and narcotics.Some historians question the historicity of the claims of his critics, arguing that his destruction of temples has been exaggerated,and noting that he also built temples,paid for their maintenance, employed significantly more Hindus in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors did, and opposed bigotry against Hindus andShia Muslims. Aurangzeb was born on 3 November 1618, in Dahod, Gujarat. He was the third son and sixth child of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal. In June 1626, after an unsuccessful rebellion by his father, Aurangzeb and his brother Dara Shukoh were kept as hostages under their grandparents' (Nur Jahan and Jahangir) Lahore court. On 26 February 1628, Shah Jahan was officially declared the Mughal Emperor, and Aurangzeb returned to live with his parents at Agra Fort, where Aurangzeb received his formal education in Arabic and Persian. His daily allowance was fixed at Rs. 500, which he spent on religious education and the study of history. On 28 May 1633, Aurangzeb escaped death when a powerful war elephant stampeded through the Mughal Imperial encampment. He rode against the elephant and struck its trunk with a lance, and successfully defended himself from being crushed. Aurangzeb's valour was appreciated by his father who conferred him the title of Bahadur (Brave) and had him weighed in gold and presented gifts worth Rs. 200,000. This event was celebrated in Persian and Urdu verses, and Aurangzeb said: If the (elephant) fight had ended fatally for me, it would not have been a matter of shame. Death drops the curtain even on Emperors; it is no dishonor. The shame lay in what my brothers did! TheMughal Armyunder the command of Aurangzeb recapturesOrchhain October 1635. Aurangzeb was nominally in charge of the force sent toBundelkhandwith the intent of subduing the rebellious ruler ofOrchha,Jhujhar Singh, who had attacked another territory in defiance of Shah Jahan's policy and was refusing to atone for his actions. By arrangement, Aurangzeb stayed in the rear, away from the fighting, and took the advice of his generals as theMughal Armygathered and commenced the Siege of Orchha in 1635. The campaign was successful and Singh was removed from power. Aurangzeb was appointed viceroy of the Deccan in 1636. After Shah Jahan's vassals had been devastated by the alarming expansion of Ahmednagar during the reign of the Nizam Shahi boy-prince Murtaza Shah III, the emperor dispatched Aurangzeb, who in 1636 brought the Nizam Shahi dynasty to an end. In 1637, Aurangzeb married the Safavid princess Dilras Banu Begum, posthumously known as Rabia-ud-Daurani. She was his first wife and chief consort as well as his favourite. He also had an infatuation with a slave girl, Hira Bai, whose death at a young age greatly affected him. In his old age, he was under the charms of his concubine, Udaipuri Bai. The latter had formerly been a companion to Dara Shukoh. In the same year, 1637, Aurangzeb was placed in charge of annexing the small Rajput kingdom of Baglana, which he did with ease. In 1644, Aurangzeb's sister,Jahanara, was burned when the chemicals in her perfume were ignited by a nearby lamp while inAgra. This event precipitated a family crisis with political consequences. Aurangzeb suffered his father's displeasure by not returning to Agra immediately but rather three weeks later. Shah Jahan had been nursing Jahanara back to health in that time and thousands of vassals had arrived in Agra to pay their respects.Shah Jahan was outraged to see Aurangzeb enter the interior palace compound in military attire and immediately dismissed him from his position of viceroy of the Deccan; Aurangzeb was also no longer allowed to use red tents or to associate himself with the official military standard of the Mughal emperor.Other sources tell us that Aurangzeb was dismissed from his position because Aurangzeb left the life of luxury and became a Faqir. In 1645, he was barred from the court for seven months and mentioned his grief to fellow Mughal commanders. Thereafter, Shah Jahan appointed him governor of Gujarat where he served well and was rewarded for bringing stability. In 1647, Shah Jahan moved Aurangzeb from Gujarat to be governor ofBalkh, replacing a younger son,Murad Baksh, who had proved ineffective there. The area was under attack fromUzbekandTurkmentribes. While the Mughal artillery and muskets were a formidable force, so too were the skirmishing skills of their opponents. The two sides were in stalemate and Aurangzeb discovered that his army could not live off the land, which was devastated by war. With the onset of winter, he and his father had to make a largely unsatisfactory deal with the Uzbeks, giving away territory in exchange for nominal recognition of Mughal sovereignty. The Mughal force suffered still further with attacks by Uzbeks and other tribesmen as it retreated through the snow toKabul. By the end of this two-year campaign, into which Aurangzeb had been plunged at a late stage, a vast sum of money had been expended for little gain. Further inauspicious military involvements followed, as Aurangzeb was appointed governor ofMultanandSindh. His efforts in 1649 and 1652 todislodgethe Safavids atKandahar, which they had recently retaken after a decade of Mughal control, both ended in failure as winter approached. The logistical problems of supplying an army at the extremity of the empire, combined with the poor quality of armaments and the intransigence of the opposition have been cited by John Richards as the reasons for failure, and a third attempt in 1653, led by Dara Shikoh, met with the same outcome. Aurangzeb became viceroy of the Deccan again after he was replaced by Dara Shukoh in the attempt to recapture Kandahar. Aurangzeb regretted this and harboured feelings that Shikoh had manipulated the situation to serve his own ends. Aurangbad's twojagirs(land grants) were moved there as a consequence of his return and, because the Deccan was a relatively impoverished area, this caused him to lose out financially. So poor was the area that grants were required fromMalwaand Gujarat in order to maintain the administration and the situation caused ill-feeling between father and son. Shah Jahan insisted that things could be improved if Aurangzeb made efforts to develop cultivation.Aurangzeb appointed Murshid Quli Khanto extend to the Deccan thezabtrevenue system used in northern India. Murshid Quli Khan organised a survey of agricultural land and a tax assessment on what it produced. To increase revenue, Murshid Quli Khan granted loans for seed, livestock, and irrigation infrastructure. The Deccan returned to prosperity, Aurangzeb proposed to resolve the situation by attacking the dynastic occupants ofGolconda(theQutb Shahis) andBijapur(theAdil Shahis). As an adjunct to resolving the financial difficulties, the proposal would also extend Mughal influence by accruing more lands.Aurangzeb advanced against the Sultan of Bijapur andbesieged Bidar. TheKiladar(governor or captain) of the fortified city, Sidi Marjan, was mortally wounded when a gunpowder magazine exploded. After twenty-seven days of hard fighting,Bidarwas captured by the Mughals and Aurangzeb continued his advance.Again, he was to feel that Dara had exerted influence on his father: believing that he was on the verge of victory in both instances, Aurangzeb was frustrated that Shah Jahan chose then to settle for negotiations with the opposing forces rather than pushing for complete victory. The four sons of Shah Jahan all held governorships during their father's reign. The emperor favoured the eldest,Dara Shukoh.This had caused resentment among the younger three, who sought at various times to strengthen alliances between themselves and against Dara. There was no Mughal tradition ofprimogeniture, the systematic passing of rule, upon an emperor's death, to his eldest son.Instead it was customary for sons to overthrow their father and for brothers to war to the death among themselves.HistorianSatish Chandrasays that ""In the ultimate resort, connections among the powerful military leaders, and military strength and capacity  the real arbiters"".The contest for power was primarily between Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb because, although all four sons had demonstrated competence in their official roles, it was around these two that the supporting cast of officials and other influential people mostly circulated.There were ideological differences— Dara was an intellectual and a religious liberal in the mould of Akbar, while Aurangzeb was much more conservative—but, as historiansBarbara D. MetcalfandThomas R. Metcalfsay, ""To focus on divergent philosophies neglects the fact that Dara was a poor general and leader. It also ignores the fact that factional lines in the succession dispute were not, by and large, shaped by ideology.""Marc Gaborieau, professor of Indian studies at l'École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales,explains that ""The loyalties of  seem to have been motivated more by their own interests, the closeness of the family relation and above all the charisma of the pretenders than by ideological divides.""Muslims and Hindus did not divide along religious lines in their support for one pretender or the other nor, according to Chandra, is there much evidence to support the belief that Jahanara and other members of the royal family were split in their support. Jahanara, certainly, interceded at various times on behalf of all of the princes and was well-regarded by Aurangzeb even though she shared the religious outlook of Dara. In 1656, a general underQutb Shahi dynastynamed Musa Khan led an army of 12,000 musketeers to attack Aurangzeb,and later on the same campaign Aurangzeb, in turn, rode against an army consisting 8,000 horsemen and 20,000Karnatakamusketeers. Having made clear that he wanted Dara to succeed him, Shah Jahan became ill withstranguaryin 1657 and was closeted under the care of his favourite son in the newly built city ofShahjahanabad(Old Delhi). Rumours of the death of Shah Jahan abounded and the younger sons were concerned that Dara might be hiding it for Machiavellian reasons. Thus, they took action:Shah ShujaInBengal, where he had been governor since 1637, Prince Muhammad Shuja crowned himself King at RajMahal, and brought his cavalry, artillery and river flotilla upriver towards Agra. Near Varanasi his forces confronted a defending army sent from Delhi under the command of Prince Sulaiman Shukoh, son of Dara Shukoh, and Raja Jai Singhwhile Murad did the same in his governorship of Gujarat and Aurangzeb did so in the Deccan. It is not known whether these preparations were made in the mistaken belief that the rumours of death were true or whether the challengers were just taking advantage of the situation. After regaining some of his health, Shah Jahan moved to Agra and Dara urged him to send forces to challenge Shah Shuja and Murad, who had declared themselves rulers in their respective territories. While Shah Shuja was defeated atBanaresin February 1658, the army sent to deal with Murad discovered to their surprise that he and Aurangzeb had combined their forces,the two brothers having agreed to partition the empire once they had gained control of it.The two armies clashed at Dharmat in April 1658, with Aurangzeb being the victor. Shuja was being chased throughBiharand the victory of Aurangzeb proved this to be a poor decision by Dara Shikoh, who now had a defeated force on one front and a successful force unnecessarily pre-occupied on another. Realising that his recalled Bihar forces would not arrive at Agra in time to resist the emboldened Aurangzeb's advance, Dara scrambled to form alliances in order but found that Aurangzeb had already courted key potential candidates. When Dara's disparate, hastily concocted army clashed with Aurangzeb's well-disciplined, battle-hardened force at theBattle of Samugarhin late May, neither Dara's men nor his generalship were any match for Aurangzeb. Dara had also become over-confident in his own abilities and, by ignoring advice not to lead in battle while his father was alive, he cemented the idea that he had usurped the throne.""After the defeat of Dara, Shah Jahan was imprisoned in the fort of Agra where he spent eight long years under the care of his favourite daughter Jahanara."" Aurangzeb then broke his arrangement with Murad Baksh, which probably had been his intention all along.Instead of looking to partition the empire between himself and Murad, he had his brother arrested and imprisoned at Gwalior Fort. Murad was executed on 4 December 1661, ostensibly for the murder of thediwanof Gujarat sometime earlier. The allegation was encouraged by Aurangzeb, who caused thediwan'sson to seek retribution for the death under the principles ofSharia law.Meanwhile, Dara gathered his forces, and moved to thePunjab. The army sent against Shuja was trapped in the east, its generalsJai Singhand Dilir Khan submitted to Aurangzeb, but Dara's son, Suleiman Shikoh, escaped. Aurangzeb offered Shah Shuja the governorship of Bengal. This move had the effect of isolating Dara Shikoh and causing more troops to defect to Aurangzeb. Shah Shuja, who had declared himself emperor in Bengal began to annex more territory and this prompted Aurangzeb to march from Punjab with a new and large army that fought during theBattle of Khajwa, where Shah Shuja and hischain-mailarmoured war elephants were routed by the forces loyal to Aurangzeb. Shah Shuja then fled toArakan(in present-day Burma), where he was executed by the local rulers. With Shuja and Murad disposed of, and with his father immured in Agra, Aurangzeb pursued Dara Shikoh, chasing him across the north-western bounds of the empire. Aurangzeb claimed that Dara was no longer a Muslimand accused him of poisoning the MughalGrand VizierSaadullah Khan. After a series of battles, defeats and retreats, Dara was betrayed by one of his generals, who arrested and bound him. In 1658, Aurangzeb arranged his formal coronation in Delhi. On 10 August 1659, Dara was executed on grounds of apostasy and his head was sent to Shahjahan.Having secured his position, Aurangzeb confined his frail father at the Agra Fort but did not mistreat him. Shah Jahan was cared for by Jahanara and died in 1666.",Easy

"In historical terms, a legacy is something that is handed down from one period of time to another period of time. A historical legacy can be counted in later times as a good thing or a bad thing. For example, the invention of the wheel (for carts, as a potters wheel, as a grinding wheel to help turn grain into flour, and as an early water wheel) in Mesopotamia can be seen as something good. The development of slavery is a bad legacy. Sometimes countries or civilizations can leave a legacy that will be remembered for a long time. Buddha and Confucius left moral legacies. More than 2000 years ago the Greek Mathematician, Euclid of Alexandria, collected and wrote down ideas about geometry and measurement in a text called Elements. Students still use these ideas when they learn about mathematics. In Athens, people voted on what the city would do. This early form of democracy is a cultural legacy. Ancient Rome elected some of their leaders and made many Roman laws that became a legal legacy for later civilizations. Roman and Greek architecture is also often imitated, as another kind of legacy. Some families pass objects and ideas down from generation to generation. These heirlooms and ideas can also be called legacies. It may have to do with a person or many people. individuals can leave a historical legacy. Legacies are, more or less, what we remember about a person or a country. What an individual or a country does today might, in the future, be regarded as being important enough to be thought of as a memorable legacy from the 21st Century. Legacy is a similar concept as inheritance and heritage. It is something we inherit from past generations and pass to our future generations. Usually heritage refers to material and economical inheritance, while legacy refers to immaterial and cultural inheritance.

"The Age of Enlightenment was an 18th century cultural movement in Europe. It was most popular in France, where its leaders included philosophers like Voltaire and Denis Diderot. Diderot helped spread the Enlightenment's ideas by writing the Encyclopédie, the first big encyclopedia. The Enlightenment grew partly out of the earlier scientific revolution and the ideas of René Descartes. The Enlightenment's most important idea was that all people can reason and think for themselves. Because of this, people should not automatically believe what an authority says. People do not even have to believe what churches teach or what priests say. This was a very new idea at the time. Another important idea was that a society is best when everyone works together to create it. Even people with very little power or money should have the same rights as the rich and powerful to help create the society they live in. The nobility should not have special rights or privileges any more. These were very new ideas at the time. They were also dangerous thoughts for the people in power. Many Enlightenment philosophers were put in prison or were forced to leave their home countries. Many of the Founding Fathers of the United States believed the Enlightenment's ideas. For example, the idea that a government's job is to benefit all of a country's people - not just the people in power - was very important to them. They made this idea about a government ""for the people"" one of the most important parts of the new United States Constitution and the new American government they created. The Enlightenment's ideas were also important to the people who fought in the French Revolution of 1789. In some countries, kings and queens took some of the Enlightenment's ideas and made changes to their governments. However, they still kept power for themselves. These kings and queens were called ""enlightened despots."" Examples include Catherine II of Russia (Catherine the Great), Frederick II of Prussia, and Gustav III of Sweden. During the Age of Enlightenment, as more and more people began to use reason, some began to disagree with the idea that God created the world. This caused conflicts - and, later, war. Many ideas that are important today were created during the Enlightenment. Examples of these ideas include: The Enlightenment's ideas about thinking with reason, having personal freedoms, and not having to follow the Catholic Church were important in creating capitalism and socialism. Important people in the Enlightenment came from many different countries and shared ideas in many different ways. Some of the best-known Enlightenment figures, organized by home country, are: Montesquieu Voltaire Jean-Jacques Rousseau Denis Diderot Immanuel Kant David Hume (1711-1776) Alessandro Volta (1745-1827) Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) Adam Smith",Easy

"The Welsh language is the Celtic language of Wales that is still spoken throughout the country. Around 21% of the people of Wales (about 600,000 people), as well as some people outside Wales, can speak Welsh. Many people in Wales say they can understand some form of Welsh, such as spoken, written, or can read Welsh, even if they do not speak it all the time. Almost all Welsh people understand and can use the English language. Welsh is a compulsory subject for children in all schools in Wales, and it is taught as a second language in non-Welsh language schools. In Welsh, it is known as Cymraeg, or yr iaith Gymraeg, which means ""the Welsh language"" in Welsh. The Welsh language is related to the Cornish language, spoken in south-west Great Britain, and also related to Breton language, spoken in Brittany in the north-west of France. Welsh has mutations. Mutations are when a sound (in speech) or a letter (in writing) changes at the start of a word. An example is the Welsh word ""gwneud"", which in English it means ""to do"", and ""dod"", which means ""to come"" ""dewch i mewn"" which means ""come in"". Sometimes the word changes from ""gwneud"" to ""wneud"", and from ""dod"" to ""ddod"". These sounds (in speech) or letters (in writing) changes also occur within, and at the end, of words, although the simplified classification found in ordinary books does not mention this. In Welsh, there is formal and informal Welsh. Formal Welsh is used when writing, in formal documents, and when speaking to a group (because it also includes the plural), when speaking to someone older than yourself, speaking to someone you have just met, or someone you would like to show respect towards. Formal words and phrases use variations of ""chi"", meaning ""you."" Sometimes, people will ask you to call them ""chi."" Informal Welsh is used when sending e-mails or sending text messages to your friends or family, and when talking with people you have known for a long time. Informal words and phrases use variations of ""ti"", meaning ""you."" Sometimes, people will ask you to call them ""ti."" There are some sounds and letters that exist in Welsh but not in English, such as the letters (and sounds) ch and ll. The first sound is pronounced like the Scottish Loch Ness, and an example Welsh word that uses the 'ch' is ""bach"", which means ""small."" Ll is a voiceless 'l,' and is made by placing the tongue on the top of the top gum, and blowing. A Welsh word that uses the 'll' is ""llan"", which means ""church."" Both 'ch' and 'll' are single letters in the Welsh alphabet, along with 'dd,' 'ff,' 'ng,' 'ph,' 'rh,' and 'th.' Here are some things to say in Welsh. How to say it is in brackets (). Here are a few other words; Welsh books and newspapers have been printed for hundreds of years. Some of these books have been translated into English, and some books in other languages have been translated into Welsh. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was translated into Welsh, with the translation of ""Harri Potter a Maen yr Athronydd"", which means the same as the English title. BBC Radio Cymru is a Welsh-language radio station that is available throughout Wales. Some local radio stations have some Welsh and English programs during the day. The Welsh television channel, S4C, has been on air since 1982. It broadcasts shows such as the soap opera Pobol y Cwm, and children's programs such as Superted and Sam Tân (known as Fireman Sam in English). In August 2009, the mobile phone maker Samsung (with provider Orange) unveiled a new Welsh language mobile phone would be available from September 2009. It includes Welsh language predictive text and menus.  The Welsh Alphabet has some extra letters that are not used in English, and does not have some others. Although certain letters do not exist in Welsh, they are used sometimes to make sounds that could not possibly be made otherwise. A good example is the word ""garej"" (meaning garage). The letter ""j"" does not exist in the Welsh language, and is a lend-word from English. The traditional word for ""garage"" in Welsh is modurdy, which means, ""motor house"". Another lend-word is ""toiled,"" which means ""toilet"" in English. There are now many lend-words in spoken Welsh. Here is the Welsh alphabet; A1, B, C, CH2, D, DD2, E1, F2, FF2, G, NG2, H, I1, J, L, LL2, M, N, O1, P, PH2, R, RH2, S, T, TH2, U1, W1 2, Y1. 1 These letters are vowels. The letter 'W' can be used either as a vowel (when it is said 'oo' like in the Welsh word 'cwm' (coom) meaning 'valley') or as a consonant (when it is said like it is in English, for example in the Welsh word 'gwyn' (gwin) meaning 'white'). This is the same with letter 'I' which can also be used as a consonant (when it is said like an English Y like in 'iogwrt' (yog-oort) meaning yoghurt. 2 Letters that are not in the English alphabet, or have different sounds. CH sounds like the 'KH' in Ayatollah KHoumeini. DD is said like the TH in 'There'. F is said like the English 'V'. FF is said like the English 'F'. NG sounds like it would in English but it is tricky because it comes at the beginnings of words (for example 'fy ngardd' - my garden). One trick is to blend it in with the word before it. LL sounds like a cat hissing. PH sounds like the English 'F' too, but it is only used in mutations. RH sounds like an 'R' said very quickly before a 'H'. TH sounds like the 'TH' in 'THin'. W has been explained in the sentences before about vowels.",Easy

"Dementia is a collective name for all kinds of complaints and symptoms. In people with dementia, the brain does not work properly, so that information no longer ends up properly.

While people with dementia can be forgetful, forgetfulness is different from dementia In dementia, the nerve cells break down. Sometimes the nerve cells themselves do not break down, but the connections between them no longer work properly. This decrease causes the brain to work less well. In some patients, the decline is much faster than in others. As a result, one person can live independently for a long time and the other cannot. Eventually, the patient becomes so weakened by the dementia that it dies from the disease. An infection can also arise from pneumonia, because the patient can no longer swallow.",Easy

"Charlemagne, born in 742 and died 28 January 814 in Aachen, is the greatest representative of the Carolingian dynasty. He is so called because of the nickname he was given, ""Charles the Great"" (in Latin, Carolus Magnus). Charlemagne is the son of Pepin the Short, king of the Franks, and Bertrade of Laon (later nicknamed Bertha Broadfoot). At the death of his father, he began his reign as king of the Franks in 768. During his reign, he significantly expanded his kingdom, beginning with Italy: he became king of Lombards (a region in the north of Italy). He also conquered territories in what is now known as Germany. In Rome, the pope disputed with the accusers. Charlemagne was to be the arbiter: he would have to decide who was right. The pope swears on the gospel that he was innocent. Charlemagne believed the pope. The pope was judged innocent. They met at the St. Peter's Basilica for Christmas Mass 25 December 800. Charlemagne is in the company of his daughters and sons. He prays. Pope Leo III placed a crown on the king's head. Everyone shouted 'victory to Charles the great' Charlemagne is now surprised he is crowned Emperor of the West until his death. He is the first emperor since the end of the Roman Empire in 746. He was the first emperor since the end of the Roman Empire in 476. Charlemagne located his capital in Aachen, in modern-day Germany. He had a sumptuous palace built there, with a chapel that can still be seen today. He was surrounded by poets, writers, and historians. He also built a school next to his palace where future clerks were educated, that is, the people who would run the administration of his kingdom. From 782 this School was partly run by Alcuin. Charlemagne reigned over an immense empire. As such he decided to organize it through the grant of lands to faithful soldiers who would, in exchange, come to his aid in wars. This marked the beginning of feudalism. At the frontiers of his empire, the lords who received territory where charged with the defence of the empire. These were called "" Marquis"" because they were on the ""Marches"", that is the boundaries, of the empire. In order to have his policies obeyed and carried out, Charlemagne regularly sent reliable men to go throughout the territory to implement his decisions and verify that the lords were behaving themselves. These envoys always travelled in pairs. They were called ""Missi Dominici""(messengers of the Lord) At Charlemagne's death, his son Louis the Pious (his nickname came from the fact that he was very religious) succeeded him. He had three sons, who fought each other for the right to rule over his empire after his death in 814. They ended up by being in agreement: The western part was West Francia, which became France (it was governed by Charles the Bald). The third brother, Lothair I, had a kingdom stretched out in length between the other two, Lotharingia, or Middle Francia, which went from Holland to northern Italy.

Prior to European colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was a part of the Inca Empire — the largest State in pre-Columbian America. The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century. During most of the Spanish colonial period, this area was called upper Peru. After the proclamation of independence in 1809 followed 16 years of war before the Republic, named for Simón Bolívar, on August 6, 1825. Bolivia has struggled with periods of political instability, dictatorships and economic woes. Bolivia is a Democratic Republic. It is a developing country, with a medium human development index and a poverty level of 53%. The main economic activities include agriculture, forestry, fisheries, mining and the production of goods, such as textiles, clothing, refined metals, and refined petroleum products. Bolivia is very rich in minerals, particularly tin. The Bolivian population, estimated at 10 million, is multi ethnic, including Amerindians, mestizos, Europeans, and Africans.

Bolivia got cut off from the Pacific Ocean, making the Bolivian Navy since then on the Peruvian side of Lake Titicaca exerts. From 1932 to 1935 was at war with neighboring Bolivia Paraguay. This Chaco War was due to the possible find of oil on the Chaco Boreal, a large sparsely populated Savannah.

"Carolus Linnaeus or Carl Linnaeus was a Swedish botanist, physician and zoologist. He was born 23 May 1707 in southern Sweden (Smaland region) and died January 10, 1778 in Uppsala. He is known for his work on taxonomy (that is to say, the classification of plants and animals). He defined the biological nomenclature of living species by giving them Latin names, which was later recognized in all languages ​​of the world. His name, Linnaeus, comes from name of a tree (the lime tree) in Swedish. He carried eight different names because at that time the family names changed. He published his first works in Latin under the name ""Carolus Linnaeus"". Reaching an immense reputation and as a physician of the royal family of Sweden, he was knighted in 1761, taking the name Carl von Linné (von is the word that indicates nobility, as in French and German). The region of his childhood was rich in forests and lakes. Carl's father, Nils, was a church curate who loved plants, his mother was the daughter of a minister. Carl maintained his own garden from the age of 5. But Carl's destiny was to become a minister as well. He left his family home at the age of nine for a school 40km (25 miles) away and subsequently pursued his studies in a high school. But he didn't like his religious studies very much. He was more interested in nature. His comrades had already nicknamed him ""the little botanist"". He then began to study medicine. In 1727, he entered the University of Lund, being interested in its library collections. In 1728, he entered a more important university (that is, Uppsala's). During his medical education, there was an important botanical part (characteristics and virtues of plants, and preparing them for the pharmacy). At the age of 24, he created a classification of plants, based on their reproductive organs and published his first work. Carl Linnaeus travelled to Lapland, bringing back a huge collection of plants. Then 1735, he departed to the Low Countries to obtain his diploma and to publish his writings. Between 1735 and 1738, he visited Great Britain and France, where he met with scientists such as Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu. He then returned to Sweden where he practiced medicine in Stockholm. He was married in 1739 with Sara Elisabeth Morea. Together they had seven children, two boys and five girls. One of his sons also became a botanist. In 1747, he became the doctor of Sweden's royal family and obtained a title of nobility in 1761. Linnaeus's most important work dates from 1735, his system of Nature. In each new edition, he improved his system. This was until the tenth edition, from 1758, in which Linnaeus generalizes binomial nomenclature. This system gives two Latin names to all living species. Here is an example with Homo sapiens. Another example: the Red Fox, is given the international Latin name of Vulpes vulpes. His classification includes all animals (birds, mammals, amphibians...) His next book, in 1753, classified all plant families. An example of his observations is about shellfish. During his voyage to Lapland, Linnaeus visited some pearl fishers. They had to open thousands of shellfish to find pearls: he was intrigued. When he returned to Uppsala, he attempted an experiment by introducing a very small piece of fine plaster into pearl mussels, replacing them in the river. Six years later, he harvested several pearls about the size of peas. He sold his idea (certificate) en 1762, but the buyer forgot to follow through. In 1900, 250 years later, the idea was discovered again in his manuscripts. It was only in the 20th century that the Japanese developed cultured pearls.

"The Battle of Harpers Ferry was fought September 12–15, 1862. It was part of the Maryland Campaign of the American Civil War. As Gen. Robert E. Lee's Confederate army invaded Maryland, a portion of his army under Maj. Gen. Thomas J. ""Stonewall"" Jackson was sent to capture Harpers Ferry. His troops surrounded, bombarded, and captured the Union garrison at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia). This was a major victory at relatively minor cost. During the Maryland Campaign of 1862, Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia advanced north through the Shenandoah Valley into Maryland. Lee planned to capture the garrison at Harpers Ferry to secure his line of supply back to Virginia. The Confederate Army was being pursued at a leisurely pace by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's Army of the Potomac. Even though the Union Army outnumbering him more than two to one, Lee chose the risky strategy of dividing his army. He sent one portion to converge and attack Harpers Ferry from three directions. Col. Dixon S. Miles, Union commander at Harpers Ferry, insisted on keeping most of the troops near the town instead of taking up commanding positions on the surrounding heights. He had been ordered by McClellan to hold the town until McClellan could send more soldiers. The slim defenses of the most important position, Maryland Heights, first encountered the approaching Confederate on September 12. But there was only a brief skirmishing. Strong attacks by two Confederate brigades on September 13 drove the Union troops from the heights. During the fighting on Maryland Heights, the other Confederate columns arrived. They were astonished to see that critical positions to the west and south of town were not defended. Jackson methodically positioned his artillery around Harpers Ferry and ordered Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill to move down the west bank of the Shenandoah River in preparation for a flank attack on the Federal left the next morning. By the morning of September 15, Jackson had positioned nearly 50 guns on Maryland Heights and at the base of Loudoun Heights. He began a fierce artillery barrage from all sides and ordered an infantry assault. Miles realized that the situation was hopeless. He agreed with his subordinates to raise the white flag of surrender. Before he could surrender personally, he was mortally wounded by an artillery shell and died the next day.

"Florence Nightingale, (12 May 1820 – 13 August 1910), was an English nurse. She helped create the modern techniques of nursing. She became a leader of the team of nurses who helped wounded soldiers during the Crimean War. She was the first female to receive the Order of Merit, the highest honour awarded to a British person. As a nurse she was given the name 'The Lady with the Lamp' because at night, she checked on the wounded soldiers and always carried 'The Lamp' with her. She helped make modern nursing possible. Nightingale wrote a lot. She lived to be 90 years old. In her lifetime she was concerned with spreading medical knowledge. Some of her books were written in simple English so that they could easily be understood by those with poor reading skills. She also was an early user of graphs and diagrams to display data. Nightingale was helped to understand statistics by her country's leading expert on public statistics, William Farr. He was a founder of medical statistics, and epidemiology. Farr worked with her on all the statistics from the Crimean War, which she publicised in her writing. She proved that more men had died from disease than fighting, a very important piece of information. The disease in question was mostly cholera. Cholera is caused by a bacterium which is spread by people drinking water which is contaminated by sewage. Unfortunately, both she and Farr believed the disease was caused by foul air: this was called the miasma theory. The miasma theory was refuted by John Snow, who discovered the real cause of an outbreak in London. The cause was foul water from a water pump in Broad Street, London. Snow's work was published in 1855, but it was 30 years before the germ theory was generally accepted. Farr publicly acknowledged he was wrong in 1866, but Nightingale never really gave up the miasma idea. London's cholera epidemics stopped once the authorities built sewage treatment plants, delivered cleaner water, and built a system of underground pipes which kept sewage from seeping into the water supply. Florence Nightingale was born into an upper class British family in 1820 in Florence, Tuscany, Italy. She was named after the town where she was born. The family moved back to London when Florence was a young girl. She was a Unitarian. Although her parents expected her to become a wife and a mother, in 1845 she decided to become a nurse. While she was training she campaigned for better conditions for poor people in Britain. In 1854 when the Crimean War began, Florence was working in Harley Street in London. After reading many reports about the poor treatment of sick and injured soldiers, she travelled to Crimea to see for herself and discovered the hospitals were crowded and dirty. She knew Sidney Herbert, who was Secretary of War during the Crimean War and he helped her. At the hospital in Istanbul where the injured soldiers were sent, Florence realized that soldiers died more often from diseases like cholera than from their injuries in war. She used her knowledge of maths and statistics to show the British government that providing better conditions for sick and injured soldiers would help them win the war. She was, however, quite wrong about how cholera spread. There is a syndrome named after her called ""Florence Nightingale Syndrome"". It occurs when a soldier falls in love with a nurse. While she was working in Crimea she became known as “The Lady with the Lamp” because she would walk around the hospital in the evening carrying a lamp and check on the soldiers. When she returned to England she started a school in 1860 for nurses at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London. She wrote her most important book Notes on Nursing. She was a keen Christian but also believed that pagan and eastern religions also contained genuine worth. She was a strong opponent of discrimination against all types of Christians as well as against non-Christians. Nightingale believed religion helped provide people with the fortitude for arduous good work. In 1907, Florence Nightingale became the first woman to be awarded the Order of Merit by King Edward VII. Nightingale died in 1910 in London. There are many statues of her in Britain, including one in Waterloo Place in London and a Florence Nightingale museum, also in London.",Easy

"“Cantonese” is actually another name for “Guangdong.” Cantonese food comes from Guangdong province in China as one of the “Eight Culinary Traditions of Chinese Cuisine”. The eight Chinese cuisines are related to different provinces in China, and the Cantonese food is related to Guangdong province. The main taste for Cantonese food is usually light and fresh, with its own distinctive taste. Since the Cantonese food has a long history and absorbs the advantages of other nations, it has distinctive cooking techniques. These reasons led Cantonese food be popular around the world. It's said that Guangdong in ancient China always links trade with other countries as a south province near the ocean. The transport is much more easier than other regions, so ancient traders regarded it as the major port of exit. That's also why Cantonese cuisine spread earliest and influenced farthest, but the most important reason is that the Cantonese cuisine has its unique taste which attracted many foreigners. In ancient China, farmers in Guangdong always suffered natural disasters, since the region is tropical and subtropical monsoon climate with long time summer and abundant rainfall, even the typhoons are frequent. People had to try to find any food in nature as much as possible to survive. Foods such as “wood ears”, “lily bus”, have also been the main ingredients for the current Cantonese food. Because of the special geographic area that is surrounded by mountains and facing the sea, Guangdong province always has abundant resources (fruits and plants) and marine and freshwater products. The local people tried to cook the unique cuisine since ancient times, so nowadays, the Cantonese cuisine has become the most popular cuisine around the world. Cantonese cuisine has many sorts of food, but the basic and typical cuisine is “Chinese steam eggs.” It's easy to cook, and is made by beating eggs and then steaming them which maintains the nutrition from the protein in the eggs. The cuisine corresponds the Cantonese specialties which taste light and nutritious. It is worth mentioning that there is another popular Cantonese food named ""Shahe Noodles”, the name of the noodles is a part of district in Guangzhou ( a Chinese city) for now. The “Shehe noodles” are famous for their texture which is elastic and a little chewy, and they are not easy to freeze or dry, so it's necessary to buy them fresh in strips or sheets to make them wider. The Cantonese desserts are also popular around the world. It's a traditional habit for local people to serve the desserts with tea, along with the meals. The sorts for the desserts are abundant such as “sun cake” “mooncake” “red bean paste pancake”, and there is a traditional Cantonese dessert named “Tang” that is made with “cane sugar, malt sugar, nuts and fruit.” In addition, some kids prefer “shaved ice” with “sweet syrup”. Most strangely, Cantonese cuisine provides “fermented tea,” which the local people named “Bolei” or Mandarin Pu’er. It's really a typical symbol as Cantonese culture since it has a long history. The secret for cooking Cantonese cuisine is skillful techniques, so the use of the ingredients is extremely important. A successful Cantonese cook must know how to use them better. The common methods for cooking Cantonese food are somewhat diverse, such as “stir-frying,” “deep-frying,” “shallow-frying,” “braising,” “boiling,” “steaming,” and “roasting.” It's also the significance of the Cantonese food that every kind of the natural taste is worth cherishing. While steaming food does not appear difficult, it requires great effort and patience.",Easy

"Sexual dimorphism in biology means that the male and the female of a species look noticeably different. The word comes from the Greek: di (two) and morphe (form). The features that distinguish the two sexes of a species are called secondary sex characteristics. They are not directly part of the reproductive system. The difference between sexes can include: Sexual dimorphism may be the result of natural selection or more specifically sexual selection, that is, competition between members of the same species for reproduction: some traits would give an individual an advantage over its rivals in survival and reproduction. More generally, sexual dimorphism is inherited, which means the differences between males and females have survival value. Some animals show these differences only during mating season. Deer shed their antlers and peacocks shed their tails out of season. This minimises the key disadvantage of sexual dimorphism, which is, it makes the male much easier to be seen by predators. There is other polymorphisms. Human have a noticeable sexual dimorphism.

"French (Français) is a language spoken in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and several countries of Northern Africa (Tunisia, Gabon, etc.) and Western Africa (for example, Uganda), in the Caribbean (places like Martinique) and elsewhere. It is also the official language of the Canadian province of Quebec and one of the official languages of New Brunswick. French is a Latin language like Spanish and Italian. French uses the Latin alphabet just as English does, with the addition of several accent marks that are not used in English: the acute accent or accent aigu (é), the grave accent or accent grave (è), and the circumflex accent or accent circonflexe (ê). There is also a diacritical mark called a cedilla or cédille, which is placed under the letter c (ç) to give it a soft pronunciation (like an ""s"" sound) in certain situations where it would otherwise be pronounced hard (like a ""k""). There are 110 million people who can speak French natively. But there are 300 million French speakers total, which means that 190 million people decided to learn the language as adults! This is because there is a lot of interesting literature in French. French is also a language often used in diplomacy. French was first spoken in France. Four of France's neighbors — Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Monaco — also use French as one of their official languages. And because of colonization, French is spoken in Canada (the majority in Québec), Louisiana, some countries in Africa, and other places around the world. French evolved from the Latin language, just like Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian. In the 1600s, French people came to Canada and settled in the area we now call Québec. Some French people (who were expelled from Canada) also settled in Louisiana, which was named in honor of King Louis XIV of France. Louisiana is now a state of the United States. In the 1800s, France conquered large parts of northern, western, and central Africa. As France took over ruling these territories and their populations, they established French as the language of instruction in schools, and as the official language of the government. Over time, French became the second native language of many African people, although local languages are still used most often in the home. Although France no longer rules these former colonies, they still use French in daily life. Some famous authors or poets in this language are: This song can be sung as a 'round', which is when one person or group starts the song, and when they arrive at the end of the first verse, the second person or group begins.",Easy

"Ganymedes is a Greek vase painting attributed to the Berlin painter. It dates to about 500 BC. It was painted on a bell krater, now in The Louvre. The painting appears on one side of an Attic red-figure bell krater of clay. It dates to 500-490 BC. The bell krater measures 33cm in height and 33cm in diameter. A bell krater was a vessel in which water and wine were mixed at banquets. The Ganymedes krater is lugged, meaning it has very short handles, one on each side of the krater at the opening. The krater does not have a foot so it was probably set on a stand of some sort. Ganymedes was a handsome Trojan prince whom Zeus fancied. On this krater, Ganymedes is depicted as beardless, and his hair is loose and flowing. These are Greek conventions that indicate the subject is a youth. He plays with a hoop and holds a cockerel, the gift of Zeus. These are further indications that Ganymedes is a youth. On the opposite side of the krater, Zeus is seen wearing a himation and carrying a sceptre. He is depicted hurrying toward Ganymedes along a decorative meander. Zeus (or his eagle) carried Ganymedes to Mt Olympus. The youth served there as Zeus' cupbearer. The Berlin painter favored the arrangement of figures seen on this krater: one figure standing out against the black surface of the bowl on a band decorated with a meander. The Berlin painter trained with the Attic red-figure Pioneers, who taught him to study the body in movement and represent nudity. He produced a large number of works over his 50-year career.",Easy

"The Pancreas is an organ within the human body. Its primary function is to make the hormone Insulin, which is used by the body to break down carbohydrates and glucose so that the body can use them and give you energy. People can suffer from an illness called Diabetes. This is when the Pancreas stops working, or doesn't work as well. It causes the body to not break down sugar properly, so people can feel tired because they don't get the energy from their food. It can also cause damage to other organs, like the kidneys. This is because glucose is removed from the body when you go to the toilet to pass urine. All that sugar builds up in the kidneys and stops them working as well as they should.

Then, in July 1912, the Slye family floated on the Ohio River towards Portsmouth, Ohio. The Syles family wanted a more stable life in Portsmouth. So, they bought land on which they could built a home. But, because of the flood of 1913, they were able to move their houseboat to the land. So, they continued living in the houseboat on dry land. In 1919, the Slyes bought a farm in Duck Run, located near Lucasville, Ohio which is 12 miles north of Portsmouth. There they built a six-room home.

When Giorgio Vasari wrote about him in Lives of the Artists, in the 1500s, he was already known as Fra Giovanni Angelico (Brother Giovanni who is like an Angel). The Italians usually call him il Beato Angelico (the Blessed Angelico). He has been called this for a long time, because he was thought to be blessed by God who gave him the talent of painting, and also because he was such a good and holy man. The name ""Blessed Angelico"" has now been made official, because in 1982 Pope John Paul II ""conferred beatification"" which means that he is now on the way to being made a saint. Vasari says about him: ""It is impossible to think of enough good things to say about this holy father, who was so humble and modest in everything that he did and said, and whose pictures were painted with such cleverness and holy faith."" Fra Angelico was born in Mugello near Fiesole in Tuscany, Italy probably about 1385–87 and died in Rome in 1455. Nothing is known about his parents. He was baptized Guido or Guidolino. In 1407, he joined the Dominican Order at Fiesole. In 1423, when he became officially a friar, he changed his name from Guido to Fra Giovanni (Brother John). (People who are accepted into a holy order, usually take a new name.) Like the other ""brothers"" (friars) of the Dominican Order, he wore a white robe and a black cloak, and shaved part of his head. Fra Angelico had a brother called Benedetto who was also a Dominican friar. Fra Benedetto painted illuminated manuscripts. Fra Angelico possibly learnt to paint manuscripts as well. The convent of San Marco in Florence has several manuscript books that he is thought to have painted. He was very busy with other work at the convents where he lived, but he still found time to paint pictures, which very soon became famous. In January and February 1418, he was paid for paintings that he did in the church of Santo Stefano del Ponte. Between 1418 and 1436, Fra Angelico painted an altarpiece for the church in Fiesole, which has been damaged. Age caused the some of the paint to come off, or fade, and other artists have painted over some of Fra Angelico's work while trying to repair the paintings. The top part of the altarpiece is in the National Gallery, London. It shows Christ in Glory, surrounded by more than 250 figures, and is a large and magnificent piece of work. It has been described as one of the best works in the gallery. In 1436, a new Dominican Convent of San Marco was established in Florence in some older monastery buildings. Fra Angelico was one of the friars from Fiesole who moved to Florence. This was an important move for Fra Angelico because Florence already had a great number of artists from whom he could learn. The convent had a very wealthy ""patron of the arts"" called Cosimo de' Medici who loved to buy works of art for himself and his favourite churches. Cosimo took the largest of the friars' rooms, called cells, at the convent so that he could have a quiet place for religious thought. Fra Angelico painted a picture showing the Magi at Bethlehem on the wall of Cosimo's cell. Cosimo employed Fra Angelico to paint more pictures for the convent. All the cells for the friars were built upstairs around the sides of a square courtyard with a garden in the middle (called a cloister). On the wall at the top of the stairs, Fra Angelico painted a fresco of the Angel Gabriel announcing the birth of Jesus to the Blessed Virgin Mary. This is one of his most famous pictures. Fra Angelico then began to paint a picture in each of the monk's cells. Each cell has large picture with a round top on the wall beside the window. At least six of these paintings were done be by Fra Angelico, and others were done by artists who copied his style of painting. These pictures were to help the friars with their prayers. In 1439, he finished one of his most famous works, which is the altarpiece for San Marco's Church, which is where the friars worship. It shows the Madonna and Child on a throne, surrounded by saints from different dates, who are all grouped together as if they were standing in a room in Heaven, talking about holy things. This type of painting called a ""Sacred Conversation"" later became very popular, but this is one of the first ones. In 1445, Pope Eugenius IV sent a message for Fra Angelico to come to Rome to paint the frescoes of the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament at St Peter's. The chapel was later demolished by Pope Paul III to make way for the new St.Peter's Basilica and Fra Angelico's work was lost. Vasari says that one of the popes (it might have been Eugenius or Pope Nichoas V) asked Fra Angelico if he would like the very important job of Archbishop of Florence. But Fra Angelico did not want such a high job and he suggested the name of another friar for the position. In 1447 Fra Angelico went to the city of Orvieto with his pupil, Benozzo Gozzoli, to paint some pictures for the Cathedral there . One of his other pupils was called Zanobi Strozzi, but he did not become as famous as Benozzo. From 1447 to 1449, Fra Angelico was back at the Vatican, where Pope Nicholas V had built a small chapel where he could pray privately. The pictures that Fra Angelico and his pupils painted there are the lives of two young saints St. Stephen and St. Lawrence, who were both ""martyrs"" (they were killed because of their Christian faith). The small chapel, with its bright colours and gold leaf decorations is like a jewel box. From 1449 until 1452, Fra Angelico was back at his old convent of Fiesole, where he was the Prior (the head man). Fra Angelico's pupils were probably left in Rome to finish the work on the chapel. In 1455, Fra Angelico went back to Rome, probably to look at the work in Pope Nicholas' Chapel. He died at the Dominican Convent and was buried in the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Pope John Paul II beatified Fra Angelico on October 3, 1982, making him officially known as the ""Blessed Angelico"". In 1984 the pope made him the patron of Catholic artists. Fra Angelico never wanted to be important, and even though he was so talented he never put himself above other people. He thought his most important job was caring for others. He always prayed before he picked up his brushes to paint, and he never made any changes to his pictures later, because he believed that the Holy Spirit was guiding him. He painted a great number of scenes of the Crucifixion and he would always cry while he was painting them. The words on his grave say: Fra Angelico was working at a time when the style of painting was in a state of change. The changes had begun a hundred years before his time with the works of Giotto. Fra Angelico would have seen the famous pictures of the ""Life of Saint Francis"" that Giotto did for the church of Santa Croce in Florence. In Giotto's paintings the figures look more real and solid and lifelike than in the pictures of other painters of the 1300s. Giotto was also very good at painting the emotions on peoples faces and the actions that showed how they were feeling. His work was a big influence on every artist who saw it. At the same time, rich patrons like Cosimo de Medici liked to show off their wealth. They often did this by ordering paintings that had lots of bright colour and real gold backgrounds. The red colour called ""vermilion"" was one of the most expensive. But the most expensive colour was a beautiful blue made by grinding up a semi-precious stone called Lapis lazuli. This type of painting is called ""International Gothic"". Some artists of Fra Angelico's day were expert at doing paintings that would make very rich people happy. But other painters, like Masaccio were followers of Giotto and painted in a very plain way. Fra Angelico was able to paint in both ways. If the Pope or a rich family wanted an altarpiece or a fresco that had gold and expensive bright colours, then Fra Angelico could do it. But his most famous paintings have no gold and no bright colours. They are the simple gentle paintings of the life of Jesus that he did for the friars in their cells at San Marcos. This gallery shows stories from the life of Jesus. The square paintings are in tempera. They are all parts of a big altarpiece and are about 25cm wide. The ""tondo"" (round painting) is a small altarpiece about 1.4 metres wide. All the paintings with arched tops are frescos and were painted for the Dominican brothers.

"The Middle Ages are a time period in European history that stretched from the end of the Western Roman Empire (in the 5th century) to the start of the Renaissance and the time Christopher Columbus discovered the New World in 1492. (at the end of the 15th century). The 'Middle Ages' are called this because it is the time between the fall of Imperial Rome and the beginning of the Early modern Europe. This period of time is also known as the Medieval Age, the Dark Ages, or the Age of Faith (because of the rise of Christianity). When used narrowly, the term ""Dark Ages"" refer only to very early period, from 476 to 800 (when Charlemagne became king). Across Europe, the fall of the Roman Empire, after the invasions of different barbarian tribes, devastated towns and cities and their inhabitants. The Dark Ages are given this name because during this period of time Europe was in disarray, and it was not fun to live there and since few could write, little is known about it. Much of the knowledge that the Romans used (science, technology, medicine, and literature) was lost. The Dark Ages period was marked by mass migrations, wars and plagues. This lasted some 300 years until the development of feudalism partly diminished the continuous violence. Emperor Charlemagne was crowned in 800, and he promoted order, education and civilization. Europe began slowly regain what was lost during those centuries. During the Middle Ages, Europe changed as the remains of a great empire (the Western Roman Empire) slowly became independent countries (England, France (The Franks), Germany (Germania), Hungary, Spain, Portugal, Poland, and Russia. Due to invasions and disorganized society, royal authority, too weak, was unable to properly protect the people. So the latter put themselves under the protection of a lord. In exchange, they worked for him, paying him taxes and giving him a portion of their harvests. This put in place a society divided between the owners of land (then the key to wealth) and those who worked it. Men were bound to each other by ties of loyalties granted more or less freely. Beginning in the 11th century, the development of towns allowed a new group (bourgeois artisans, merchants, and judicial and administrative officials) to gain importance, but at the same time, laborers in craft industries became more numerous. The society was Christian and was organized in Western Europe through the Catholic Church, while in Eastern Europe, after the schism of 1054 it was the Orthodox churches that oversaw the population. The attempted political unification of Europe by the Carolingians failed after the disintegration of the Frank empire in 843. While in the Germanic countries the Holy Roman Empire remained, to the west, very individualized countries progressively came into existence such as France and England. Dynastic kingdoms would compete for several centuries for these questions. The economy remained largely tied to agricultural production. Agriculture experienced significant change beginning in the 12th century, with practically none in the 10th century. The 14th century was a period of great difficulty in Europe; agriculture declined but remained dominant in the 15th century. Craft industry was embryonic in the cities at the beginning of the 11th century. But the urban growth that took off in the 12th century developed it. At the same time, major commerce resumed throughout continental Europe and the Mediterranean world. Wealthy merchants organized it. Society was organised into categories: those who worked (labourers), those who fought (warriors), and those who prayed (priests). The workers (farmers and artisans in the countrysides) represented over 90% of the European population. In the 10th century, they were subject to the authority of the warriors (the lords). Gradually, either through purchase or by force, they get their freedom (the freedom of urban immigration from the villages to the cities). The peasant world became more unequal, with the greater part of the population living in difficulty from day to day, while a tiny minority, the farmers, was able to play and important role in the campaigns. The warriors (the nobility's army) would levy taxes on the agricultural production and the individual farmers are put in difficulty by the endless conflicts of the 14th century and the 15th century. A new nobility, made up of royal administrators, appeared in the 15th century. In the Middle Ages, Europeans were all true believers. For the most part they were Christians, but divided after the schism of 1054 into Catholics in the west, center and south of Europe, and the Orthodox in the east and southeast. Christians sought salvation of the soul above all else and feared the Last Judgment that would lead some to the eternal torment of Hell and others to eternal happiness in Paradise. For that, in the conduct of their ephemeral earthly life, they relied on the recommendations of the Church which were locally proclaimed by priests and popes. These monks were the gatekeepers for a population that can not read or write (except for a small minority), and can not have access to sacred books. The churches were responsible for education, but basic for the population. They were the only ones that could help the sick and the poor. The Catholic Church imposed the Peace of God to reduce the damage associated with wars between the lords. Efforts to reform the Catholic Church at the Council of Constance (1414-1418) failed. Believers proposed new ways to practice religion, such as John Wycliffe in England and Jan Hus in Bohemia (who was executed for this reason). Growing concern about salvation led some Catholics to question the validity of their religious beliefs and practices, particularly the heavy reliance on Works, on the veneration of saints and on spectacular expressions of penance. At the start of the 16th Century, this resulted in the birth of the Lutheran and Calvinist Churches, which separated from Rome. Intellectual and artistic life, weakened by the Germanic invasions of the fifth century, began again with the Carolingian Renaissance in the ninth century. Transfer of knowledge, largely controlled by the Catholic church, continued in monasteries and later in universities. After Carolingian art, Romanesque and Gothic art developed covering Europe in monuments testifying to the faith of the people. The Late Middle Ages were the last two centuries of the Middle Ages, from 1300 to 1492. During this period the gun changed war and aristocracy and feudalism became less important. States founded standing armies. Before, armies were only formed when there was a war. States only made their laws, money and identity the same in the entire country. Technology, economy and science developed. Cities were founded and existing cities grew larger and richer. France and England fought the Hundred Years War. The Grand Duchy of Moscow regained its independence from the Mongols just like the Chinese, and under the name ""Russia"" became the most important state in Eastern Europe. In the 15th century, the Ottoman Turks conquered the Byzantine Empire. That event cut off the Silk Road, and the Europeans had to find new trade routes. In turn, the Muslims were driven off Spain. This event triggered the period called the Great Expeditions. In the late Middle Ages the Frisians rebelled against the Habsburgians from 1515 until 1523. They were lead into battle by the legendary warriors and warlords Donia and Jelckama. They were eventually defeated and decapitated (beheaded) in Leeuwarden. Meanwhile, the remains of Eastern Rome had become the Byzantine Empire, which was started by Roman emperor Constantine in 330, and likewise had a capital city named Constantinople. The Byzantine empire controlled Asia Minor, Southern Spain, Northern Africa and sometimes southern Italy but its lands were slowly eaten away by enemies like the Turks and the Franks. As a walled city on a peninsula the city of Constantinople was extremely difficult to attack. The Byzantines were eventually destroyed by the Ottoman Turks, who seized Constantinople in 1453. They called the city by its present-day name, Istanbul. This event is sometimes called the end of the Middle Age. Islam was founded in the early 7th century by the prophet Muhammad. Muslims believe that the Qur'an is God's ultimate revelation to mankind. Islam spread quickly along the major trade routes of the old world, finding appeal with traders and travellers. The Islamic religion soon split; between the Sunni Muslims and the Shi'a. The Sunni religion is the majority (roughly 85% of Muslims belong to this sect), whereas most Shi'a live in modern-day Iran and Iraq. The Sunni-Shi'a split has been compared to the Catholic-Eastern Orthodox split of the Christian church much later in 1054. Muslims quickly conquered the Christian countries of Iraq, Syria, Egypt, North Africa and Spain. The Christians were able to keep France and other European countries. Later Muslims took other countries such as Persia and India where they built the Mughal Empire. The Muslim Ottoman Empire eventually conquered parts of eastern Europe. The Muslims took hold of vast areas of land making them a superpower of the Middle Ages. Christianity in Europe confronted Islam in the Middle East during the Crusades, in the Iberian Peninsula during the Reconquista. From the fifteenth century, Christianity, had to face the conquering Ottoman Turks advancing to Europe and Central Balkan. During the Early Middle Ages, Muslims achieved what is remembered as a golden age of knowledge. During these times of strife in Europe, Muslim caliphs gathered the ancient texts of the great empires (Rome, Greece, Egypt) and attempted to re-integrate that knowledge. During this time a Persian Muslim helped develop progress in algebra. The golden age of Islam ended with the Turkoman invasions in the 11th century.",Easy

Its riots resulted in a total of 34 deaths, about 1,100 injuries, 4,000 arrests, 977 buildings destroyed or damaged, and 35 million of dollars in damage after five days of violence.

Sometimes the nerve cells themselves do not break down, but the connections between them no longer work properly. This decrease causes the brain to work less well. In some patients, the decline is much faster than in others. As a result, one person can live independently for a long time and the other cannot.

"The Knights of the Round Table were characters in the legends about King Arthur. They were the best knights in King Arthur's kingdom, and lived in King Arthur's castle, Camelot.

"The Hague (Dutch: Den Haag or s-Gravenhage) is the Netherlands' third largest city, after Amsterdam and Rotterdam. While Amsterdam is the nation's capital, The Hague is the seat of government and the king. It's also the capital of the South Holland province. The City itself has 500,000 inhabitants, the agglomeration has more than 1 million. L'Aia (Italian Name) - The Hague (English name) - La Haye (French) The Hague's history began around 1230, when count Floris IV of Holland (Holland is a Dutch region, so not the whole country) decided to build a hunting residence along a pond, nowadays called the Hofvijver. His son, Willem II, expanded the residence and it became a palace, nowadays called the Binnenhof. Willem died before the palace was completed, so it was finished by his son Floris V. Since then, the counts of Holland used The Hague as their residence and administrative center when in Holland. Around the Binnenhof and the Hofvijver grew a village, called Haga. From the 17th century on, the name 's-Gravenhage was used (Old Dutch, the count's wood). When the Eighty Years' War, the Dutch independence war against the Spanish, started, the Spanish troops easily conquered the town, due to the absence of city walls. The government of Holland even wanted to demolish the city, but this was prevented by William of Orange, the leader of the Dutch revolt. After the Netherlands declared their independence, The Hague became the seat of government of the Dutch Republic. It never got city rights, but did have the benefits that came with it. In 1806, The Hague was granted city rights by Louis Bonaparte. After the Napoleonic Wars, modern-day Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands became one country, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, with Williams of Orange's descendants as kings and queens. Every two years, the capital switched from Amsterdam to Brussels, but The Hague remained the seat of government. After the Belgian revolt and separation in 1830, Amsterdam became the only capital, while The Hague stayed the seat of government. The Hague quickly grew, resulting in annexing (taking over) nearby municipalities, like the rural village Loosduinen. Many new neighborhoods where built. Most of them for Dutchmen who retired after they came back from the Dutch colony Dutch East Indies, modern-day Indonesia. In World War II The Hague was conquered by the Germans after the world's first paratroop assault. They built he Atlantic Wall straight trough the city, causing a large quarter to be demolished by the Nazi's and the evacuation of the people of neighboring fishing village Scheveningen. In March 1945 the British mistakenly bombed the historic and heavily populated Bezuidenhout quarter, causing 551 deaths. The Hague is divided into 8 boroughs (Dutch: stadsdelen): The Hague houses many major international and European organisations. Most of them have something to do with justice. Together with New York City, Geneva an Vienna it's one of the major United Nations cities. Because of all these organizations The Hague's motto is Vrede en Recht (Peace and Justice). The Hague's public transport is operated by HTM. The city has 11 tram lines, 3 light rail lines (which connect the city to its suburbs, like Zoetermeer) and 8 bus lines. The Hague has two major train stations: Den Haag Centraal (The Hague Central) and Den Haag Hollands Spoor. Southbound and northbound trains stop at Hollands Spoor, eastbound and westbound trains begin or terminate at Centraal. Centraal is also the terminal station for Line E of the Rotterdam subway. The Hague shares an airport with neighboring Rotterdam: Rotterdam The Hague Airport. It's also served by Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.",Easy

"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Hindi: मोहनदास करमचन्द गांधी, Mohāndās Karamchand Gāndhī; Gujarati: મોહનદાસ કરમચંદ ગાંધી; 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was a leader of nationalism in British-ruled India. He is more commonly called Mahatma Gandhi; mahatma is an honorific meaning ""high-souled"" or ""venerable"" in Sanskrit. He was first called this in 1914 in South Africa. He is also called Bapu in India (Gujarati endearment for ""father"", ""papa""). He was the Martyr of the Nation since 1948. Rabindranath Tagore gave him this name. Gandhi was one of the most important people involved in the movement for the independence of India. He was a non-violent activist, who led the independence movement through a non-violent protest. Mohandas Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, Gujarat, India. Several members of his family worked for the government of the state. When Gandhi was 18 years old, he went to England to study law. After he became a lawyer, he went to the British colony of South Africa where he experienced laws that said people with dark skin had fewer rights than people with light skin. He decided then to become a political activist, so he could help change these unfair laws. He created a powerful, non-violent movement. During Gandhi's life, India was a colony of the United Kingdom, but wanted independence. In 1930, Gandhi led the Salt March. When he returned to India, he helped bring about the country's independence from British rule, inspiring other colonial people to work for their own independence, break up the British Empire, and replace it with the Commonwealth. People of many different religions and ethnic groups lived in British India. Many people thought that the country should break into separate countries so that different groups could have their own countries. In particular, many people thought that Hindus and Muslims should have separate countries. Gandhi was a Hindu, but he liked ideas from many religions including Islam, Judaism and Christianity, and he thought that people of all religions should have the same rights, and could live together peacefully in the same country. In 1938, Gandhi resigned from Congress. He said that he was no longer able to work through Congress to unite the divisions in caste and religion. He also felt that he had little to offer to the political process. In 1947, India became independent from the British Empire and formed two separate countries: India and Pakistan. Gandhi wanted independence, but did not want the split into two different countries. Instead of celebrating on independence day, he was mourning the division of India. Gandhi's principle of satyagraha, often translated as ""way of truth"" or ""pursuit of truth"", has inspired other democratic and anti-racist activists like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Nelson Mandela. Gandhi often said that his values were simple, based upon traditional Hindu beliefs: truth (satya), and non-violence (ahimsa). On January 30, 1948, Gandhi was assassinated by an extremist Hindu activist, Nathuram Godse, who was angry because he felt that Gandhi was too lenient towards Muslims. Godse was hanged as punishment for this.",Easy

"A verb is a kind of word (see part of speech) that usually tells about an action or a state and is the main part of a sentence. Every sentence has a verb. In English, verbs are the only kind of word that changes to show past or present tense. Every language in the world has verbs, but they are not always used in the same ways. They also can have different properties in different languages. For example, in some other languages (e.g., Chinese & Indonesian) verbs do not change for past and present tense. This means the definition above only works well for English verbs. There are sixteen verbs used in Basic English. They are: be, do, have, come, go, see, seem, give, take, keep, make, put, send, say, let, get. The word verb originally comes from *were-, a Proto-Indo-European word meaning ""a word"". It comes to English through the Latin verbum and the Old French verbe. In simple sentences, the verb may be one word: The cat sat on the mat. However, the verb may be a whole phrase: The cat will sit on the mat. Verbal phrases can be extremely difficult to analyse: I'm afraid I will need to be going soon. There seem to be three verbal phrases here, which add to something like Sorry, I must go soon. In English and many other languages, verbs change their form. This is called inflection. Most English verbs have six inflected forms (see the table), but be has eight different forms. You should notice that some of the verb forms look the same. You can say they have the same shape. For example, the plain present and the plain form of walk have the same shape. The same is true for the past and the past participle. But these different forms can have different shapes in other verbs. For example, the plain present of be is usually are but the plain form is be. Also, the past of eat is ate, but the past participle is eaten. When you look for a verb in the dictionary, it is usually the plain form that you look for. An English sentence must have at least one primary-form verb. Each main clause can only have one primary-form verb. English has two main kinds of verbs: normal verbs (called lexical verbs) and auxiliary verbs. The difference between them is mainly in where they can go in a sentence. Some verbs are in both groups, but there are very few auxiliary verbs in English. There are also two kinds of auxiliary verbs: modal verbs and non-modal verbs. The table below shows most of the English auxiliaries and a small number of other verbs. There are several auxiliary verbs: The follow verbs are modal auxiliaries Auxiliary verbs also inflect for negation. Usually this is done by adding not or n't. Sometimes the verb do. It does not really change the meaning. It is also used in the negative when no other auxiliary verbs are used. Many other languages do not use the verb do as an auxiliary verb. They use the simple present for do, and the simple past or perfect for 'did Many people think that all different ways of using verbs are all different tenses. This is not true. There are three main systems related to the verb: tense, aspect, and mood. Tense is mainly used to say when the verb happens: in the past, present, or future. In order to explain and understand tense, it is useful to imagine time as a line on which past tense, present tense and future tense are positioned. Some languages have all three tenses, some have only two, and some have no tenses at all. English and Japanese for example have only two tenses: past and present. Chinese and Indonesian verbs do not show tense. Instead they use other words in the sentence to show when the verb happens. Aspect usually shows us things like whether the action is finished or not, or if something happens regularly. English has two aspects: progressive and perfect. In English, aspect is usually shown by using participle verb forms. Aspect can combine with present or past tense. English uses the gerund-participle, usually together with the auxiliary be (and its forms am, is, are, was, and were) to show the progressive aspect. Many other languages, such as French, do not use progressive tenses. The past perfect can be used to express an unrealized hope, wish, etc. After If, wish and would rather, the past perfect can be used to talk about past events that never happened. Finally, English mood is now usually shown by using modal verbs. In the past, English had a full mood system but that has almost completely disappeared. The subjunctive mood now uses the plain form. There is also a form of be that is used in conditionals to show that something is not true (e.g., If I were a bird, I would fly to California.) Certain parts of a sentence naturally come before verbs or after them, but these are not always the same for all verbs. The main sentence parts are: subject, object, complement, and modifier. Almost all English sentences have subjects, but sentences that are orders (called imperatives) usually do not have any subjects. A subject usually comes before a verb, but it can also come after auxiliary verbs. In the following examples, the subject is underlined and the primary verb is in bold. Many verbs can be followed by an object. These verbs are called transitive verbs. In fact, some verbs must have an object (e.g., take), but some verbs never take an object (e.g., sleep). Verbs that do not take an object are called intransitive verbs. Some verbs can even have two objects. They are called ditransitive verbs. In the following examples, the object is underlined and the primary verb is in bold. Some verbs can or must be followed by a complement. These verbs are called linking verbs or copula. In the following examples, the complement is underlined and the verb is in bold. Verbs can be modified by various modifiers, mainly adverbs. Note that verbs generally do not need modifiers; it's usually a choice. In the following examples, the adverb is underlined and the verb is in bold. Verbs also commonly take a variety of other modifiers including prepositions. Sometimes a verb and another word can have the same shape. In these cases you can usually see the difference by looking at various properties of the words. Sometimes a verb and an adjective can have the same shape. Usually this happens with participles. For example, the present participle interesting and the adjective interesting look the same. Verbs are different from adjectives, though, because they cannot be modified by very, more, or most. For example, you can say ""That is very interesting,"" so you know interesting is an adjective here. But you cannot say ""My teacher is very interesting me in math"" because in this sentence interesting is a verb. On the other hand, if you cannot change the 'be' verb to 'seem' or 'become', it is probably a verb. The gerund-particle sometimes looks like a noun. This is especially true when it is used as a subject, as in the following example: The main differences between these verbs and nouns are: modifiers, number, and objectcomplement Verbs cannot generally be modified by adjectives and nouns cannot generally be modified by adverbs. So, in ""Running regularly is good for you"", running is a verb because it is modified by regularly, an adverb. Verbs cannot change for number, so if you can make the word plural, it is a noun, not a verb. For example, ""this drawing is nice"" can change to ""these drawings are nice"", so drawing is a noun. But ""drawing trees is fun"" cannot change to ""drawings trees is fun"", so it is a verb here. Many verbs can take objects or complements, but nouns cannot. So, in ""parking the car is hard"", parking is a verb because it takes the object the car. But, if you say, ""there's no parking"", parking may be a noun because it does not have an object. Some verbs have become prepositions. Again, usually these share a shape with participles. Here are some examples: The main difference between verbs and prepositions is that verbs have a subject. Even if the subject is not written, you can understand what it is. Prepositions do not have a subject.",Easy

"Society is the term to describe human beings together (collective, the sum of their social networks and power networks). It does not refer to everything everybody thinks or does, but only to those things that everybody acts upon - or refuses to do - quite reliably. Because it must keep even the poorest and weakest members of a society willing to help even the richest and strongest, a society is very concerned with its citizenship, rights, ethics and time limits. These are basic ways to achieve fairness. If they break down badly, people will think the society is unfair and start taking things from each other, refusing to help each other, or seeing those who have more as cheats. While every society is different, the way it breaks down and fails is very often the same: fraud, theft, violence, war and sometimes even genocide if people stop identifying with the society and thus identify with what they think of as a ""race"" of people. A new society may be formed out of only those who still agree, or who just survive the collapse of an old failed one. If the strength and unity of any society's members' willingness to help each other is to be measured, it is called social capital, because it substitutes for other forms of capital. One needs less money with more solidarity in society, because the collective substitutes for the currency. However, usually, the strength is not directly measured, but only assumed. People take risks that society will support them, without knowing for sure that it will. For instance, they may refuse to obey the law, and count on their fellow society members to free them in a jury or court of appeal. A social contract sets out rules for this kind of cooperation. One kind of social contract is a constitution - which allows for a jury or court to decide that the law, not the person, is wrong, according to the society's rules.",Easy

"Limestone is a sedimentary rock, made up mostly of the mineral calcite, a form of calcium carbonate, CaCO3. The calcium carbonate is originally produced by living organisms. Later, some of it goes into solution in sea water. Limestone rocks include mainly organic remains and precipitated carbonate. Limestone makes up about 10% of the total volume of all sedimentary rocks. Limestones are mostly made of calcium carbonate. It is originally made by small photosynthetic protists like certain bacteria, coccolithophores, and algae. Then the carbonate gets used by various animals, like bivalves and the polyps which make coral reefs. They build their shells or framework out of CaCO3 crystals. Carbonates are rocks formed from these sources, plus any CaCO3 which is precipitated out of solution. Some carbonate dissolves in the water. It gets precipitated when the physical condition of the water changes. For example, if the concentration of CaCO3 is high, then a temperature drop, or a pH (acidity) change, can cause precipitation. Florida Bay, the shallow lagoon behind the Florida Keys, is a model for the conditions which produced limestones on the continental shelf. Of course, all the species were somewhat different then but, as an ecosystem, it is similar. In the Florida Bay a type of flowering plant called sea grass is in abundance. Also in abundance is white, milky water full of calcium carbonate. This is mainly formed by Melobesia, a small red alga which lives on the sea grass.p151 Finally, the organisms produce huge amounts of slime, which is a polysaccharide. There is good reason to think the slime is produced by microorganisms to control the way their carbonate skeletons are formed.p139 As a side-effect the slime limits the amount of carbonate which goes into solution.p155 Florida Bay is a flat platform which has laid down a huge amount of carbonate rock. Many limestones contain fossils, and some are made up almost entirely of skeletal material. Chalk is ~99% coccoliths; Solnhofen limestone is famous for its animal fossils; and there are many shelly limestones from different periods. Limestone is not found much before the Cambrian period, because shelled animals had not yet evolved. When limestone is heated to a high temperature, and squeezed at the base of a mountain, it becomes the metamorphic rock marble. Marbles are fairly dense, relatively easy to cut, or be shaped into blocks, and some forms are white in colour. Limestone is hard enough to resist weathering but usually soft enough to be worked (cut and carved) by stonemasons. It is used for building material. Limestone, particularly Portland limestone, became popular in the 19th and 20th centuries for building things such as churches, banks and houses. Limestone is used to make glass and cement. It is also used to make iron in a blast furnace, to remove impurities from the iron ore.",Easy

"Finland (Suomi in Finnish, Finland in Swedish) is a large country in northern Europe. It shares borders with Norway, Sweden and Russia. The capital city is Helsinki. Other big cities in Finland are Tampere and Turku. Finland has been a member of the European Union since 1995 and uses the Euro as its currency since 2002. Finland has a population of 5.5 millions inhabitants, most of them concentrated in the southern regions of the country. The northern regions are sparsely populated. The population density (approximately 16 inhabitants per square kilometre) is the lowest in the European Union. In Finland, most of people speak Finnish as their mother tongue (nearly 90% of the population), but there is an important minority of people having Swedish as their mother tongue (5.3% of the Finnish population). Also Finland is one of the Scandinavian countries. The area now known as Finland was settled at the latest around 8500 BC during the Stone Age. The settlers came from the areas of today's Estonia and Russia. Sweden established its official rule of Finland in the 13th century. Swedish became the dominant language of noble people and used in education. The Finnish famine of 1866–1868 killed 15 percent of the population, making it the last and one of the worst famines in European history. On September 17, 1809 Finland Became part of Russia, On December 6, 1917 Finland declared its independence. During World War II, Finland fought the Soviet Union twice and lost large parts of its territory. During the next 40 years Finland remains neutral and continued to trade with the Soviet Union and western countries. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Finland tried to build relationships with former Soviet republics and Europe. Finland joined the European Union in 1995 and started using the euro as its official currency in 2002. The area of Finland totals 338,145km2. Finland has over 187,000 lakes and 179,000 islands. Lake Saimaa is the 5th largest lake in Europe. Most of Finland is low-lying ground with occasional hills. The country's largest mountain is Halti at 1324 metres and is located in the extreme north. Thick forests cover about 74 percent of Finland making it the European Union's most forested country. Wildlife includes bear, wolf, lynx, and Arctic fox. Summer days in Finland are long and cool and winter days are short and cold. During summer, daylight lasts as long as 19 hours a day in the far south and 24 hours a day in northern parts. In winter, the sun does not rise above the horizon for 51 days in the northern parts of the country. The population of Finland is about 5,400,000. Most of the population in Finland are natives. They make up about 93 percent of the population. The other major ethnic group are the Swedish. The national languages of Finland are Finnish and Swedish. Most people are Christian. The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland is the national church. More than 85 percent of the population are members of the church. Education in Finland is free and required between the ages of 7 and 16. In international surveys the education system in Finland usually rates as the best of second-best education results in the world. Finland is well known for technological and innovative companies such as Nokia phones and the Angry Birds series of video games. Almost everyone who lives in Finland is literate. Because Finland is a big country with few people, it has many large national parks. Tourists are attracted to Finland by the capital, Helsinki, the lakes, forests and the northern area known as Lapland. Commercial Baltic cruises which visit other Baltic cities like Tallinn, Stockholm and Gdansk regularly bring tourists to Helsinki. Even though the sea freezes during the winter shipping continues as normal because of ice-breaking ships. Finland has 7 World Heritage Sites (including those which are in other countries as well as Finland) including Suomenlinna, an island fortress in the bay in front of Helsinki.

"Krishnachandra Roy (1810-182) was the king of Nadia. His role in the history of Bengali literature, Bengali culture and Bengali Hindu society is unforgettable. Nadia is considered as the best man of the royal family. He was a scholar, educated in Sanskrit and Persian, and a musician. Krishnachandra, an intensely conservative king, was the patron of the proverbial geniuses of Bengal, such as Ramprasad Sen of Shaktapadavali, Bharat Chandra Raigunakar, the author of the Annadamangal poem, and the humorous Gopal Bhar. Annadamangal Kavya was composed in his royal court. The world famous pottery of Krishnanagar was started on his initiative. Krishnachandra Roy was a man of strategy. When Nawab Sirajuddaula clashed with the British, he sided with the British. He was captured during the reign of the next Nawab Mir Qasim. He was released due to the intervention of the English. The Company Government conferred the title of Maharaja on him for his loyalty. His achievement is the worship of Jagadhatri in Bengal and the introduction of Shaktras in Navadvipa. According to legend, Krishnachandra was imprisoned in 1754 for failing to pay taxes to Nawab Alivardi Khan of Bengal. The time was near Durgotsab. When the fort festival was almost over when he was finally released from the Nawab's prison, on his way back to Krishnanagar, the king realized that it was Vijaya Dashami.

"The Sumerians lived in Mesopotamia around 4000 BC. Mesopotamia or ""the Fertile Crescent"" was a region in the Middle East between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, in the territory of modern Iraq, Iran and Syria. Ancient Sumeria was very small: it occupied only a narrow stretch of this territory, where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers reach the Persian Gulf. Their territory was mostly inside the modern-day borders of Iraq, with small stretches of land in Kuwait, Iran and Arabia. Sumerian traders are known to have sailed down the Gulf as far as modern-day Qatar and Bahrain, and to have traveled upstream to Haran, in the neighborhood of the modern-day cities of Mosul and Tikirit. Since the land between these two rivers was very fertile, people first started practising agriculture (farming), there. Sumer became home to the first civilizations and cities. In the beginning these cities were independent, each city being a state or nation of its own. Each city had its own king, laws, gods, and calendar. The biggest cities were Eridu, Kish, Lagash, Uruk, Ur, and Nippur. The rulers of these cities led constant wars The Sumerians built houses, palaces and temples using mud bricks. Good stone is not found in the Euphrates delta, so it had to be transported at great expense over long distances. Small quantities of precious stone would be used to cover the brick in places, but most Sumerian buildings were brick. Sumerians made bricks by scooping wet mud into a wooden frame. The bricks would be all of the same size, but slightly rounded on top. The Sumerians preferred low, wide bricks to the standard shape we use today. Sunshine would evaporate most of the water from the brick, which hardened. Builders only rarely fired their bricks to make them totally hard. This meant that heavy rains and floods would usually destroy Sumerian buildings. Fired bricks would be decorated with paints or glazes, and assembled to form pictures on walls. Sometimes the Sumerians covered walls of brick with an added layer of mud, into which they would push cones of colored clay to decorate walls. The most famous type of Sumerian architecture was the Ziggurat. Ziggurats were many-storied structures like pyramids, or wedding cakes. Each layer was square, with a smaller layer built on top. Stairs on the outside of the ziggurat led up the sides to the top of the building. This put the top platform of the ziggurat high in the air. There the Sumerian priests put temples to their gods. It is possible they also watched the movements of the stars from observatories there, built very high on a platform of mud brick. On these large platforms were built smaller and smaller platforms, creating a pyramid shape. Originally they were made out of mud brick but Ziggurats from later times were made out of fired bricks, which were glazed and adorned with pictures or faced with stone carvings. Most people's houses did not look like this. They were simple mud brick huts, similar to those found all over the Middle and Near East. Many of them had courtyards at the center, with chambers for eating and working on the main floor, and rooms for sleeping either at the back or upstairs. We do not know what the roofs of these houses were like, but we can guess. They were built of heavy sticks set into the wall in one direction, and lighter sticks laid over them in another direction, and covered with a layer of mud. As Sumerians were mostly agricultural people, they ate what they farmed: wheat, barley, lentils, beans, garlic, onions, milk and milk products. They made bread and beer from grains. Meat, usually from goats or sheep and occasionally cattle, was probably rare in their diets; the animals were too expensive to kill. They ate apples and other kinds of foods. Records of ancient Sumerian laws show that oxen — cattle bred, de-horned and neutered for work — were valuable but potentially dangerous animals. When they escaped, they did damage to fields and sometimes injured or killed people. Sheep and goats were probably more common. The wool and leather from the animals was also useful, because it could be turned into clothing or armor or tools. Their clothing was mostly made out of wool and flax. flax is a plant with blue flowers. the stem of flax was used in making the clothing. clothing was also made out of other products they could grow themselves. The men of Sumer often had long hair with a parting in the middle. Many had long beards as well, although some men preferred to be clean-shaven. The mens attire consisted of long skirts and no shirts. woman wore floor-length gowns that covered the left shoulder. The right shoulder and arm were left bare. Sumerian women also wore their hair long. Most women would braid their locks into one long braid which they then wrapped around the top of their heads. when there were guests around women would wear a headdress. princesses wore bright colored clothes and expensive jewelry made out of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and carnelian. heavier clothing was worn in the winter and lighter clothing was worn in the summer. social status was determined by the quantity and quality of jewelry and clothing a person owned but they did not need a lot of clothing because of where they lived (in a warm, dry climate). Sumerians were the first to invent writing. They wrote with sharpened sticks made of reed – a plant that grows on the banks of rivers. One of these sticks is called a stylus. When you push this kind of pen into a tablet of raw clay, you’ll get lines that look like wedges: thicker on one side, thinner on the other. That is why their writing is called Cuneiform, which means ""wedge-shaped"". Writing consisted of small pictures. At first, these pictures were drawn into the clay with the stylus. There was a different picture for each word. That meant that a person had to know thousands of these pictures to read and write. Only very educated people, called scribes, were able to read and write. The scribes found drawing pictures to be very hard even in smooth wet clay, so they invented standard ways to combine wedges to form the pictures. After many centuries, they created very quick combinations of wedges that formed the pictures. Children went to schools to learn how to be scribes. They began by reciting prayers to their gods and promises to their teachers to study hard and learn well. Then they learned to shape clay into many kinds of tablets — rounded squares for legal contracts, and large oblongs for poetry, and cylinders or prisms for royal decrees. They also copied out word lists — rows of symbols that belonged to specific categories, like the names of kings, and the words for different kinds of jobs, and words for different products available in the markets of the city. The teachers used sticks to beat slow learners, but also gave special tutoring to the students of parents who paid extra. After learning many words, scribes practised making whole documents by copying out famous laws, poems and songs. This made them fast and accurate scribes. Scribes wrote numbers with the back end of the stylus, and used different symbols for 1, 5, 10, 20, and 60. So the number ""157"" would be written with two 60s, a 20, a 10, a 5 and two 1s (60+60= 120 + 20 = 140 + 10 = 150 + 5 = 155 + 1 +1 = 157). Scribes could add and subtract. Some seem to have known how to multiply and divide, but most did not. Highly trained scribes appear to have known some geometry and some astronomy, but the Sumerians did not have an accurate calendar. Sumerians had many gods. An was the god of the sky, Enki the god of water, Enlil the god of air, Ki the goddess of the earth, Inanna the goddess of fertility and many more. Plus, they had lots of local deities; each town had its own. The sky god An was very important, but not always very smart. In one story, he decided to destroy all humans one day, because their noise was tremendous and it kept him awake. An ordered Enki to send a flood to destroy everyone, and Enki did so. But An had forgotten that people give the gods sacrifices of food, drink, and incense. Because of this, the gods nearly starved because An was upset about a little noise. Fortunately, a Sumerian named Utnapishtim had gotten warning of the flood from Enlil, the god of air. Enlil told Utnapishtim to build a boat, and sail away on the flood with useful plants and animals in the boat. The old Sumerian man had done so, and when the flood waters receded, he sacrificed to the gods. The food revived An and the others, and they recognized their folly at last. Never again, they promised, would they try to wipe out humans. A version of this story is recorded in the Hebrew Bible, which is repeated in the Christian Bible. The Sumerians began as a series of powerful city-states. Each city had its own god and looked after itself and ruled the surrounding countryside. They fought each other as well as made alliances. This culture lasted from about 2900 - 2400 BC. They had a very distinct culture and their style of architecture, writing and religion spread throughout the Middle East. The Akkadians settled North of Sumer along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and copied many of the Sumerians' ideas. Later on, one of the Akkadian kings, Sargon I conquered all the city states of Sumer and Akkad and created the world's first empire. His reign lasted about 60 years (2371 - 2316 BC) and his empire stretched from the coast of Lebanon to Iran. When Sargon died, his empire broke up and the Sumerians and Akkadians were invaded by other groups of tribesmen from the mountains. After this, the dominant forces in the Middle East were the Babylonians and Assyrians. These two civilizations were descendents of the Akkadians who had ruled over the whole area, but they split into separate empires. The Assyrians were in the North and the Babylonians were in the South. The Sumerians as a people no longer existed, though their writing, architecture and religion influenced the civilizations in this area for centuries after. They had over 100 gods. The most famous of Sumerians is Gilgamesh, legendary king of Uruk. He is known due to the Epic of Gilgamesh, a collection of Sumerian legends, later translated and written down in Akkadian. It tells about the adventure of Gilgamesh, his friendship with Enkidu, a wild man raised by animals, and his journey to obtain the secret of immortality. In the Epic, Gilgamesh is portrayed as a young king full of arrogance and pride. Gilgamesh is a bully, and has no friends. The gods are worried because Gilgamesh is so unkind to his people, so they send Enkidu, a wild man every bit Gilgamesh's equal, to be his friend. When they meet each other, Gilgamesh starts a fight, but he discovers that Enkidu is so strong that he cannot win; but Enkidu discovers the same thing about Gilgamesh. As soon as they have tired each other out, without one or the other winning, they become fast friends. Enkidu teaches Gilgamesh kindness, while Gilgamesh teaches Enkidu to be civilized. Both grow up to be very handsome. Gilgamesh decides he needs a tree for the roof of his palace, so he proposes a quest to the cedar forest to cut down a tree. Enkidu is horrified and warns Gilgamesh of the terrifying monster Humbaba who guards the forest. Gilgamesh manages to persuade his friend to go anyway, and they go on the quest in search of the tree. Together they meet and kill the monster, and chop down the tree. But the death of Humbaba makes the gods angry. Further, the goddess Inanna sees Gilgamesh and wants him for her husband. But Gilgamesh tells her that she has already had too many husbands, and she has used them all up — she even kills them when she tires of them! Gilgamesh prefers being a bachelor, thank you. Angered, Inanna persuades her father to release the Bull of Heaven in Uruk, to destroy Gilgamesh and his people. The Bull runs wild in the streets, for to touch it is death. Many are slain by the touch of the Bull, its horns or its flanks or its tail. Enkidu and Gilgamesh go out to destroy the Bull, and they succeed in killing it. But the Bull manages to touch Enkidu, who sickens and dies. Gilgamesh is heartbroken, and refuses to let anyone care for the body or bury his friend. He delays so long that maggots begin falling out of Enkidu's eye sockets and nostrils. Finally, Gilgamesh consents to the burial of his friend, but he cannot bear the thought of dying himself. His mother tries to console him and tell him that death is normal, but the king of Uruk will not hear it. He resolves to go to the ends of the earth in search of a cure for dying — a way to become immortal. He faces many perils on his trip. First he travels through the tunnel that the Sun uses when traveling underneath the earth. He enters it at sunrise, and races to the other end, hoping to get out before the hot sun comes in at sunset, and burns him alive. He makes it, but then he must confront the scorpion monster. However, the scorpion monster's wife tells her husband to leave the human alone, he is so tired. The scorpion monster allows Gilgamesh to live, and guides him to Sudri, a woman who keeps a tavern for the gods at the end of the earth. Sudri refuses to give Gilgamesh the secret of eternal life, but the boatman offers to guide Gilgamesh to Utnapishtim, who lives forever. Together, Gilgamesh and the boatman cross the Waters of Death, though not without some trouble. The next chapters of this epic form the story of Utnapishtim, the king who saved humankind of the Great Flood. His tale is very similar to the Biblical story of Noah's Ark. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh that he cannot handle living forever, because he cannot even stay awake seven days. Despite his weariness, Gilgamesh agrees to stay awake for seven days. Mrs. Utnapishtim promises to bring Gilgamesh a loaf of bread every day so that he can eat. No sooner than she goes away to prepare the loaf for the first day, but Gilgamesh falls asleep! He sleeps all through all seven days. When he wakes, he insists to Utnapishtim that he only dozed a moment — but the seven stale and moldy loaves of bread beside him prove otherwise. Utnapishtim denies Gilgamesh the secret, and takes him back to the boatman. The boatman is sympathetic to Gilgamesh, though, and tells the king of Uruk that Utnapishtim gets his eternal life from a plant under the water. If Gilgamesh only dives into the water and brings up the plant, he will have eternal life. Gilgamesh, now thinking of home, decides to get the plant and bring it home to his royal gardens in Uruk. There, it will make everyone immortal, and the whole city will thank him. He dives into the water, retrieves the plant, and returns across the water. There, while he sleeps, a snake comes along and devours the plant. Not until he is within sight of the walls of his home city, Uruk, does Gilgamesh realize that his journey was for nothing. He weeps, but consoles himself with the knowledge that he has built a strong city which will endure long after he is dead and gone. Though Sumerians do not exist anymore, they left many technological inventions, like the wheel (which made transport easier and quicker), the potter’s wheel, baked clay, the cuneiform script, and lots of agricultural inventions: irrigation systems, agricultural tools and even beer-brewing. They may have been the first people to fit sails to boats. They made astronomical observations, and were also the first to measure time in 60-minute hours and 60-second minutes. Their priests invented clocks too, some were just like kinds of sundials and others were a type of water clock, with water dripping slowly from a pottery jar. The peasants in Sumeria were the first ones to find out how to harness animals to plows, instead of cultivating the land with hand hoes, and this allowed people to grow much more grain. Recent collaboration between archeologists and DNA analysts tell that there is a strong connection between the marsh Arabs of Iraq and Iran and the Sumerian culture.",Easy

"The Nile is one of the major rivers of the world. It is entirely within Africa. It is the longest river on Earth (about 6,650km or 4,132 miles). It begins near the equator and ends in a large delta into the Mediterranean Sea near Alexandria, Egypt. Its name is from the Greek word Neilos, meaning ""river valley"". The Nile was very important to Ancient Egyptians. With its annual flood the Nile provided most of the water used to grow crops in Egypt, whereas the rest of Egypt is a desert. Thus, the Nile Valley is an oasis. The Greek historian Herodotus wrote that Egypt was the gift of the Nile. The Nile no longer floods in Egypt since the completion of the Aswan Dam in 1970. The drainage basin of the Nile covers 3,254,555 square kilometres (1,256,591 sq mi), about 10% of the area of Africa. The Nile is composed by the junction in Khartoum of two tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile (photography taken in October) the Falls of the Blue Nile in Ethiopia (photography taken in October) The Nile in Egypt near Beni Hassan (photography taken in March) The delta and the northern valley of the Nile from space The Nile provided a great role in the development of Egyptian civilization. Silt deposits from the Nile made the surrounding land fertile because the river overflowed its banks annually. The Ancient Egyptians cultivated and traded wheat, flax, papyrus and other crops around the Nile. Water was vital to both people and livestock. The Nile was also a convenient and efficient means of transportation for people and goods. Hapy was the god of the annual floods, and both he and the Pharaoh were thought to control the flooding. The ancient Egyptian calendar was based on the 3 cycles of the Nile. These seasons, each consisting of four months of thirty days each, were called Akhet, Peret, and Shemu. Akhet, which means inundation, was the time of the year when the Nile flooded, leaving several layers of fertile soil behind. Akhet began in June. Peret was the growing season and Shemu, the last season, was the harvest season. The Nile was considered to be a causeway from life to death and afterlife. The east side of the Nile was thought of as a place of birth and growth, and the west side was considered the place of death. In Ancient Egyptian believed that the god Ra, the Sun, underwent birth, death, and resurrection each day as he crossed the sky from east to west. Thus, all tombs were west of the Nile, because the Egyptians believed that in order to enter the afterlife, they had to be buried on the side that symbolized death. adapted from English Wikipedia ",Easy
"Seagulls are birds that belong in the family of Laridae, in the order of Charadriiformes. They live on the coasts, in the fields, near the cities and in the ports. They eat fish, worms, insects and waste depending on where they are located and they nest in the larger areas of lakes, ponds, rivers and swamps. They live in large colonies. Scientific classification of the Seagull Phylum: Chordata Class: Aves Order: Charadriiformes Family: Laridae Species: Larus Ridibundus The seagulls have adaptations that allow them to satisfy their carnivorous diet. Aberdeen is a great place, the seagulls use this to their advantage. Seagulls can be observed ""dancing"" and beating their feet on the grass. The presence of the gull goes from Greenland to Central Asia, passing through most of Europe. Northern gulls migrate southwards during the winter, to go to warm places. They live also in the coastal areas but they also prefer the humid areas of the hinterland. The evolutionary background is actually very interesting as it highlights their evolutionary similarities with reptiles and dinosaurs. One of the most important discoveries that caused this bird-dinosaur hypothesis was that of the Archeopteryx of 150 million years.. This oldest bird had an essential characteristic that identified it as a bird. This closing feature of a bird was found next to the reptilian jaws and a long bony tail like a reptile. The seagull is present in the ""Seagull and the cat"" by Luis Sepúlveda. The beak is long, the wings are white, gray or black and in the young also brown. Depending on the species the young take from two to four years before becoming adults. In this phase both the colors of feathers, beak, legs and eyes change.

There he studied the Quran and the Maliki fiqh as a pupil with Ali Menguelleti, a recognized theologian from Kabylie. Béjaïa was then at the beginning of the fifteenth century a religious center and a place of influence of Sufism. He made his destination in 1415 to Tunis, where he deepened his knowledge of Maliki Madhhab.

"Annelies Marie Frank (Anne) (Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany, 12 June 1929 - Bergen-Belsen, February 1945) was a German - Jewish girl. She died during World War II, along with 6 million other Jews. She perished in the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen, Germany, in February 1945. She died of Typhoid Fever, an infectious illness usually passed onto humans by flea bites. Anne Frank became famous only after her death because of a diary she had written. After the war was over, the diary was published and has been translated into more than 70 languages. Anne is the symbol today which represents the 6 million other Jewish people who died during the Second World War. There have been many books written about her and there are also theatre plays which have been written, based on her diary. Anne received the diary as a gift from her parents for her 13th birthday, on 12 June 1942. The very first words she wrote in the diary were: I hope that I can entrust everything to you, as I have not been able to do to anyone, and I hope that you will be a great support to me. — 12 June 1942 Anne was the daughter of Otto and Edith Frank-Holländer. She had an older sister named Margot, who was born on 16 February 1926. On 13 March 1932, there was an election in Germany, in which the Nazis (people who followed Hitler) won many votes. Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933. Anne's parents realized that they and the children had no future in Germany because Adolf Hitler persecuted Jews. They fled to Amsterdam in 1933 and went to live at Merwedeplein 37 on the second floor. Anne's father Otto went to the Netherlands in the summer of 1933, Edith went in November, Anne and Margot went to their Grandmother's house in Aachen (near the Dutch border). Margot went to the Netherlands in December 1933 and Anne followed in February 1934, where she was put on the table as a birthday present for Margot. Anne and Margot both went to school in the neighborhood and learned Dutch. Anne had many friends at school and in the neighborhood, and she enjoyed playing with them. Anne loved skating, reading, watching films and she collected pictures of movie stars. The Frank family were liberal Jews. That meant that they felt connections with Jewish traditions, but were not strict about following the rules. Anne Frank had a wonderful time in Amsterdam, until the German army filed into the Netherlands and occupied it in May 1940. In 1941, everyone had to report and register if they were Jewish or Non-Jewish. There followed scores of measures against Jews and other groups that the Nazis wanted to exterminate, including Gypsies (Sinti and Roma), people with disabilities, and homosexuals. Jews weren't allowed to go to the cinema, the swimming pool, and Jewish children like Anne had to go to a Jewish school with other Jewish students. Jews were made to stay away from others. On 29 June 1942, notices were posted in all Dutch newspapers stating that the German occupiers had decided that all Jews must be sent to work camps in Germany. Margot was one of the first Jews who, on 5 July 1942, received a letter telling her that she had to go to a work camp. Anne heard from her father the following morning that they were going into hiding. Onto the back of her Father's company building at Prinsengracht 263, a small house had been built, which stood empty. It was called the ""Achterhuis"" (Secret annex) and it was part of the company ""Opekta"", which Otto Frank was a director of. On 6 July 1942, they hid themselves in that little house. Many people didn't believe that they had to go to Germany to work. They looked for houses where they could hide with the help of residents. They hoped to stay out of the hands of the Germans. But that was not easy. You had to find a place and people who would help you. It was also dangerous, because going into hiding was forbidden. The father and mother of Anne Frank had also come up with a plan. They'd been taking things to the secret annex. Four people who worked for Otto Frank decided that they wanted to help, and they all went into hiding together; Hermann van Pels, Auguste van Pels and their son Peter van Pels and later, Fritz Pfeffer. People worked for Otto Frank's company during the week and also on Saturdays. They were absolutely not allowed to know that people were in hiding in the secret annex. There were only 4 people who knew and helped those hiding there: Miep Gies, Bep Voskuijl, Johannes Kleiman and Victor Kugler. They provided food and clothing and everything else that the people in hiding needed, such as textbooks for Margot, Anne and Peter. They made curtains for the windows, and they had to be very quiet so that people who worked at the company during the day, didn't hear them. They knew that there were very heavy penalties for going into hiding, so there was a constant fear of being discovered. During the day, they could not even go to the toilet - because if they did, the people working at the company would find out there were people hiding there. They had to wait until all the people who worked there during the day, went home. Nobody knew how long the war would last. Anne regularly wrote in her diary. It became her best friend and she called it ""Kitty"". One day in 1942, Anne wrote in her diary: ""Our hiding place has only now become a real hiding place. Mr Kugler (a friend of her Father) thought it would be better to place a cupboard in front of our entrance door - but of course, a cupboard that can be rotated and that opens like a door."" Anne Frank and the other people in hiding hoped that the Germans would not find them. They thought themselves safe in the house on Prinsengracht in Amsterdam. But unfortunately, on 4 August 1944, their hiding place was discovered. The person who arrested them was called Karl Silberbauer. On 4 August 1944, a car stopped in front of the house at Prinsengracht 263 somewhere between 10:00 and 10:30am. The SS Squadron Leader, Karl Silberbauer, stepped out together with around three Dutch helpers. They had been betrayed by someone, but to this day, nobody knows who gave their secret away. It is also possible that they had been discovered during a house search. The people who had hidden there, had been there for more than two years, having arrived on 6 July 1942. Shortly after the Frank family was captured, Anne's diary and other papers were found in the secret annex by Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl. All 8 of the people who had been in hiding were taken to Camp Westerbork on 8 August, thereafter they were transported to the concentration and extermination camp at Auschwitz. Auschwitz was in Poland, which had also been occupied by the Germans. That was for Anne, the last time that she saw her father. From Auschwitz, Anne and her sister Margot were taken to the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen in Germany. Anne met one of her best friends from Amsterdam there. Her name was Hanneli Goslar. Hanneli had it somewhat better than Anne, because she sometimes got food parcels from the Red Cross. She tried to help Anne by throwing some of the food to her over the fence. Bergen-Belsen laid between the German cities of Hamburg and Hannover. Anne Frank died of Typhoid Fever around February 1945, a few days after her sister Margot. She was not even 16 years old. Six of the other hiders from the Secret Annex were taken there too. Her father, Otto Frank, was the only one from her family who remained alive.",Easy
"The violin is a string instrument that is played with a bow. The violin has four strings, which are tuned to the notes, G, D, A, and E. The violin is held between the left collar bone (near the shoulder) and the chin. Different notes are made by fingering, with the left hand while bowing with the right. It has no frets or other markers, so players have to learn the exact place to put the fingers of the left hand by memory alone. The violin is the smallest and highest pitched instrument in the string family. The other instruments in the family are: viola, cello and double bass. A person who plays the violin is called a violinist. A person who makes or repairs a violin is called a luthier. The violin is about 400 years old. By the time the modern orchestra started in the 17th century the violin was fully developed and it became the most important orchestral instrument. It is used as a solo instrument, in chamber music, in orchestral music and in jazz as well as in folk music. The violin was more like the medieval rebec which was an instrument held under the chin and bowed. In the 16th century there was an instrument called the lira da braccio, which was an early form of the violin. In the 17th century there were several families of luthiers who were extremely good at making instruments. The most famous violin makers were Stradivarius, Amati and Guarneri. Some of the instruments that these luthiers made are still in existence today. They are some of the best instruments in existence, and can fetch prices of several million dollars. The biggest part of the violin is the wooden body. It is made of spruce. Many violins also have a chinrest. This helps to hold the violin against the player's shoulder. A shoulder rest is also used. These are now made of foam, with special legs to hold them on to the violin. As these are not particularly cheap, many beginners instead use a sponge and an elastic band. To make it easier to tune the violin, many people find it helpful to have “adjusters” for “fine tuning” when the string is only slightly out of tune. These adjusters go through holes in the tailpiece. Strings used to be made of gut, but now they are mostly made of steel or nylon. Adjusters can only be used with steel strings. The bow can be made of several kinds of wood, for example pernambuco. Some players today use bows made of carbon fibre. The bow is strung with horsehair. As with most instruments, it takes years of practice to become a really good violinist. Beginners start by practicing on the “open strings” (without using the left-hand fingers). At first the beginner can pluck the strings, then he or she can learn how to use the bow. Gradually the player can learn how to stop the strings with the fingers to get all the different notes. At first the learner will play in “first position”. This means that finger 1 (the fingers are numbered from 1 to 4, the thumb being behind the neck of the instrument) is playing a note which is a whole tone above the open string, e.g. on the D string it is playing a stopped E. When he or she is more advanced they will play in other positions by moving the left hand up the fingerboard nearer to the bridge. There is also a half position in which the first finger is stretched back. The violinist has to learn to put the fingers in exactly the right place so that the music is “in tune” (this is called intonation). He will also learn vibrato. Besides plucking (pizzicato) there are many special effects such as glissando, portamento and harmonics as well as double stopping, chords or using scordatura tuning. The violin can be played either standing or sitting down. When playing solo music the violinist normally stands, but when playing in chamber music or in orchestras he sits (although this was not always the case). When sitting he may have to turn his right leg in so that it does not get in the way of the bow. In the 17th and 18th centuries composers wrote a lot of music for solo violin. Many of these composers were from Italy and were themselves violinists: Corelli, Vitali, Vivaldi, Veracini, Geminiani, Locatelli and Tartini. In Germany, Schmelzer and Biber wrote some very virtuoso violin music. Later, in the early 18th century, Bach and Handel wrote many masterpieces for the violin. In the Classical music period the great composers Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all wrote solo works for the violin as well as a vast amount of chamber music, especially string quartets. In the Romantic period many virtuoso violin works were written. These include concertos by Mendelssohn, Saint-Saëns, Brahms, Bruch, Wieniawski, Tchaikovsky, Dvořák. In the 19th century Niccolò Paganini was undoubtedly the most famous violinist. He composed and played violin music that was harder than anyone had played before. People compared him to the devil because he could play so brilliantly (and because of his looks). In the 20th century Elgar, Sibelius, Szymanowski, Bartók, Stravinsky, Berg, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Hindemith and Penderecki. In recent years the violin has also been used in jazz playing. Stephane Grappelli was especially famous for this. Some of the most famous violinists of the last century are Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz, David Oistrakh, Yehudi Menuhin, Ida Haendel and Isaac Stern. Today some of the greatest players include Itzhak Perlman, Maxim Vengerov, Vadim Repin, Nigel Kennedy, Hilary Hahn, Joshua Bell, and the fiddler Sara Watkins.",Easy

"The United States Constitution is the highest law of the United States of America. It was put in writing on September 17, 1787 by the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and later put into effect, or ratified, by representatives of the people of the first 13 states. When nine of the states ratified the document, they put forth a union of sovereign states, and a federal government for that union. That government started on March 4, 1789, taking the place of the Articles of Confederation. The Constitution of the United States is the oldest federal constitution now in use. Since 1787, changes have been made to the United States Constitution 27 times by amendments (changes). The first ten of these amendments are together called the Bill of Rights. When it was written in 1787, the Constitution had a preamble and seven main parts, called articles. The Preamble states: The Preamble is not a law. It gives the reasons for writing the Constitution. The Preamble is one of the best known parts of the Constitution. The first three words, ""We the people,"" are used very often. The six intentions that are listed are the goals of the constitution. Article One says that the Congress of the United States (the legislative branch) will make the laws for the United States. Congress has two parts (Bicameral), called ""Houses,"" the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Article says who can be elected to each part of Congress, and how they are elected. The House of Representatives has members elected by the people in each state. The number of members from each state depends on how many people live there. Each member of the House of Representatives is elected for two years. The Senate has two members, called Senators, from each state, no matter how many people live there. Each Senator is elected for six years. The original Constitution allowed the state legislatures to choose the Senators, but this was changed later by the seventeenth amendment. Article One also says how the Congress will do its business and what kinds of laws it can make. It lists some kinds of laws the Congress and the states cannot make. Article One also makes rules for Congress to impeach and remove from office the President, Vice President, judges, and other government officers. Article Two says that the President (the executive branch) will carry out the laws made by Congress. This article says how the President and Vice President are elected, and who can be elected to these offices. The President and Vice President are elected by a special Electoral College chosen by the states, for four years. The Vice President takes over as President if the President dies, or resigns, or is unable to serve. Article Two also says that the President is in charge of the army and navy. He can make treaties with other countries, but these must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate. He appoints judges, ambassadors, and other officers, but the Senate also must approve these appointments. The President can also veto bills. However, Congress can override the veto. Article Three says there will be a court system (the judicial branch), including the Supreme Court. The article says that Congress can decide which courts, besides the Supreme Court, are needed. It says what kinds of ""cases and controversies"" these courts can decide. Article Three also requires trial by jury in all criminal cases, and defines the crime of treason. Article Four is about the states. It says that all states must give ""full faith and credit"" to the laws of the other states. It also says that state governments must treat citizens of other states as fairly as they treat their own citizens, and must send arrested people back to another state if they have been charged with a crime. Article Four also says that Congress can make new states. There were only 13 states in 1787. Now there are 50 United States. It says Congress can make rules for Federal property and can govern territories that have not yet been made into states. Article Four says the United States must make sure that each state has a republican form of government, and protect the states from invasion and violence. Article Five gives two ways to amend, or change, the Constitution. Any change that is written by Congress or by a convention must be sent to the state legislatures or to state conventions for their approval. Congress decides whether to send a change to the legislatures or to conventions. Three-fourths of the states must approve a change for it to become part of the Constitution. An amendment can change any part of the Constitution, except one—no amendment can change the rule that each state has equal suffrage (right to vote) in the Senate. Article Six says that the Constitution, and the laws and treaties of the United States, are higher than any other laws. It also says that all federal and state officers must swear to ""support"" the Constitution. Article Seven says that the new government under the Constitution would not start until conventions in at least nine states approved the Constitution. Since 1787, Congress has written 33 amendments to change the Constitution, but the states have ratified only 27 of them. The first ten amendments are called the Bill of Rights. They were made in 1791. All of these changes limited the power of the federal government. They were: After the Bill of Rights, there are 17 more changes to the Constitution that were made at different times. Declaration of Independence• Constitution• Bill of Rights",Easy
"The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a non-governmental organization founded in 1947, whose aim is to promote worldwide usage of common standards.

"Petrushka is a neoclassical ballet with music by Igor Stravinsky and choreography by Michel Fokine. The ballet is based on Russian popular culture, especially a Punch-like puppet called Petrushka and the Shrovetide Fair in St Petersburg. The ballet was written for the 1911 Paris season of the Ballets Russes. It premiered on 13 June 1911 at the Théâtre du Châtelet. Vaslav Nijinsky starred as Petrushka, Tamara Karsavina played the Ballerina, Alexandre Orlov played the Moor, and Enrico Cecchetti played the Magician. The ballet was a huge success. The ballet opens in St Petersburg's Admiralty Square about 1830. Crowds are wandering about the square looking for fun. At the back of the stage, a large puppet booth is seen. The Magician raises the curtain. Three puppets are seen in the booth dancing furiously. They leave the booth to dance in the square. They collapse, and the curtain falls. The second scene is set in Petrushka's dismal little room in the puppet booth. The door opens. The Magician throws Petrushka to the floor. Petrushka recovers slowly. He shakes his fist at a picture of the Magician on the wall. He runs about the room, pounding on the walls. He breaks a hole in one wall, and falls through it. The third scene is set in the Moor's room. The Moor is sitting on a divan worshipping a coconut. The door opens. The Ballerina enters. She dances for the Moor, then sits beside him on the divan. They cuddle. Petrushka enters. He is in love with the Ballerina, and he is furious she is cuddling with the Moor. The Moor draws his scimitar, and chases Petrushka from the room. The fourth scene is set in the Square. Evening is falling. The crowd is having a good time. Suddenly, Petrushka runs from the puppet booth. He is pursued by the Moor who brandishes the scimitar. He kills Petrushka. Nothing is left except some sawdust and Petrushka's clothing. The Magician enters as night falls. The crowd leaves. The Magician picks up Petrushka's clothes. Suddenly, Petruska appears on the top of the puppet booth. He shakes his fist at the Magician and mocks him. The frightened Magican runs away. Petrushka collapses.",Easy

"The Bengali Language Movement, also known as the Bhasha Andolon, was a political movement in former East Bengal (renamed East Pakistan in 1955) advocating for the recognition of the Bengali language as an official language of the then-Dominion of Pakistan. The movement sought to allow the use of Bengali in government affairs, education, media, currency, and stamps, and to maintain its writing in the Bengali script. Bengali is the native language of over 265 million people, making it the second most spoken language in the world after Mandarin Chinese. In the early 20th century, Bengali was the dominant language in the eastern part of British India, which was known as Bengal. After the partition of India in 1947, Bengal was divided between India and Pakistan. The eastern part, which became East Pakistan, was home to over 50 million Bengalis. The Pakistani government, dominated by West Pakistani politicians, imposed Urdu as the sole official language of Pakistan in 1948. This decision was met with widespread protests from Bengalis, who saw it as an attempt to suppress their culture and identity. The Bengali Language Movement gained momentum in the late 1940s and early 1950s. A number of key events marked the movement's progress: The Bengali Language Movement had a profound impact on Bangladeshi history and culture. It helped to unify Bengalis and strengthen their sense of national identity. The movement also played a key role in the eventual independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971. The Bengali Language Movement is remembered as a watershed moment in the struggle for linguistic rights and cultural preservation.

"Geography is a science that describes and studies the Earth as a space where humans and nature interact. It's mostly concerned with locations and distribution on the Earth surface, trying to answer questions such as ""where?"" and ""why there?"". One major geographer's tool is the map, where he shows locations and distributions. Several maps may constitute an atlas. For the convenience of describing and analyzing the main content of geography: Natural geography is the part of geography where different parts of the earth and their structural elements are discussed. It consists mainly of the fossils, the atmosphere, the atmosphere, the earth's surface, and the global plant and animal world (biosphere) and discusses their problems and their solutions. The different branches of natural geography are as follows: The branch of science that studies the physical environment of the surface of the crust and the various geophysical processes at work in it is called natural geography. Most geographers are interested in dividing geography into two branches, natural and human. Many people divide geography into three branches namely natural, human and biogeography as it is not advisable to ignore the ecology of the biosphere on the surface. Over the past few decades, the definition, content, and reading methods of natural geography have changed dramatically. In the beginning, natural geography meant only the study of the natural environment (land friendliness, water and air). For example, according to Arthur Holmes (1960), ‘natural geography is the study of the Earth's surface friendliness, the oceans and the atmosphere that make up the natural environment. According to Carl Ritter (1779-1859), ""natural geography is the branch of science that considers the earth as a distinct unit with all its shapes, variations and relationships."" The work of natural geography provided. ' Considered from this point of view, natural geography is not only an integration of some geological subjects, it also reviews the type of interaction of human activities with the natural environment. Natural geography as an established branch of geography studies the spatial type in the regional context and the ecological relationship of the elements of the terrestrial environment. It also explains the reasons for the environmental relationship with the regional type, as well as the reasons for the change in the elements of the environment. From this it can be said that natural geography is a detailed study of the land, air, water and the biosphere that supports the life of animals and plants.",Easy

"The Meghna River (Bengali: মেঘনা নদী) is one of the major and holiest rivers in Bangladesh, one of the three that form the Ganges Delta, the largest delta on earth, which fans out to the Bay of Bengal. A part of the Surma-Meghna River System, Meghna is formed inside Bangladesh in Kishoreganj District above the town of Bhairab Bazar by the joining of the Surma and the Kushiyara, both of which originate in the hilly regions of eastern India as the Barak River. The Meghna meets its major tributary, the Padma, in Chandpur District. Other major tributaries of the Meghna include the Dhaleshwari, the Gumti, and the Feni. The Meghna empties into the Bay of Bengal in Bhola District via four principal mouths, named Tetulia (Ilsha), Shahbazpur, Hatia, and Bamni. The Meghna is the widest river among those that flow completely inside the boundaries of Bangladesh. At a point near Bhola, Meghna is 13 km wide. In its lower reaches, this river's path is almost perfectly straight. The Meghna is formed due to the confluence of the Surma and Kushiyara rivers originating from the hilly regions of eastern India. Down to Chandpur, Meghna is hydrographically referred to as the Upper Meghna. After the Padma joins, it is referred to as the Lower Meghna. Near Muladhuli inBarisaldistrict, the Safipur River is an offshoot of the Surma that creates one of the main rivers in South Bengal. 1.5km wide, this river is one of the widest in the country as well. At Chatalpar ofBrahmanbaria District, the riverTitasemerges from Meghna and after circling two large bends by a distance of about 240 kilometres (150mi), falls into the Meghna again nearNabinagar Upazila. The Titas forms as a single stream but braids into two distinct streams that remain separate before re-joining the Meghna. In Daudkandi, (Comilla District), the Meghna is joined by the Gumti River, which increases the Meghna's water flow considerably. The pair of bridges over the Meghna and Gumti are two of the country's largest bridges. Meghna is reinforced by the Dhaleshwari before Chandpur. Further down, the Padma River- the largest distributary of the Ganges in Bangladesh, along with the Jamuna River- the largest distributary of the Brahmaputra, join with the Meghna in Chandpur District, resulting in the Lower Meghna. After Chandpur, the combined flow of the Padma, Jamuna, and Meghna moves down to the Bay of Bengal in an almost straight line, braiding occasionally into a number of riverines including the Pagli, Katalia, Dhonagoda, Matlab, and Udhamodi. All of these rivers rejoin the Meghna at different points downstream. Near Bhola, just before flowing into the Bay of Bengal, the river again divides into two main streams in the Ganges delta and separates an island from both sides of the mainland. The western stream is called Ilsha while the eastern one is called Bamni. They form the largest delta named Ganges delta.",Easy

"Austria is a country in Europe. Austria is bordered to the north by the Czech Republic and Germany, Slovakia and Hungary are to the east, Slovenia and Italy are in the south, and Switzerland and Liechtenstein are in the west. The capital of Austria is Vienna. The main language of Austria is German. Other big cities are Salzburg and Linz. Austria has been part of the European Union since 1995 and uses the Euro as its currency. Austria has a long history. The area that is Austria today, used to be a place where the Romans were the boss. The Romans had conquered it during the expansion of the Roman Empire. During the Migration Period, the Huns were the new rulers in the area. During the Middle Ages Austria consisted of several duchies. All these duchies were part of the Holy Roman Empire. From the 10th to 13th centuries, the duchies were ruled by members of the house of Babenberg. Later, between 1278 CE and 1914 it was ruled by the members of the house of Habsburg. The Habsburgs were the Austrian Royal family. Many members of these families were also Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1804, the territories ruled by the house of Habsburg were united into the Austrian Empire (with some of them also being members of the Holy Roman Empire until that one was dissolved in 1806 after Napoleon won the battle of Austerlitz). In 1815, the German Confederation was established with Austria and Prussia as the two largest member countries. Those two however never agreed with one another and, after a war, Austria had to leave the union. Austria-Hungary was born in 1867 while the remaining part of the confederation would be renamed into German Empire in 1870. The Austrian Empire covered a big part of central Europe, including the current countries Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Slovenia as well as the southern part of Poland, the northern part of Serbia, the north-western part of Rumania, the western part of Ukraine and the north-western part of Italy. The huge number of ethnic groups in the empire created problems and in 1914 Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated by a Bosnia-Serb in Sarajevo, the capital of present-day Bosnia (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) kicking off World War I. During the World War I, Austria-Hungary was on the side of the German Empire and Italy. The First World War started after the Austro-Hungarian crown prince was murdered in Sarajevo. The culprit turned out to be a Serb, and Serbia had to surrender within 24 hours otherwise Austria-Hungary would take over the country. Russia opposed to this and Austria-Hungary asked Germany for help. Germany declared war on Russia. France interfered there too and also declared war. So the conflict was increasing and there was a world war lasting from 1914 to 1918. After World War I the empire split up and Austria became a republic. Austria's size was reduced to more-or-less today's size and the country was forbidden to unite with Germany. Economic and political problems continued during the 1920s and 1930s and in 1938 Austria became part of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. World War II crippled Austria resulting in 260,000 military deaths, 65,000 Austrian Jews killed in the Holocaust and 140,000 other Jews fleeing the country. Austria was officially neutral in the years after the end of the war. Since that time Austria has became a very peaceful and economically successful country and joined the European Union in 1995. The population of Austria is 8,205,533. The total area of Austria is 83,870 km2. About 34 of Austria is covered with mountains and because of this the climate varies greatly from one place to another. Some of Europe's highest mountains, part of the Alps, are located in Austria. The highest mountain in Austria is Großglockner at 3,797 metres. In Eastern Austria the climate is average with cold winters and warm summers. The Western part of Austria's climate changes depending on the conditions of the Atlantic Ocean. Austria is one of the countries in Europe that have the most forest land. 42 percent of the land is covered with forests. Because of this Austria has a wide variety of trees but the wildlife in Austria is scarce. Chamois, deer, and marmot are still present but the bears which used to have a large population are almost gone. Hunting is regulated to protect the remaining animals they have in the country. The official Language of Austria is German. Other popular languages are Slovene, Croatian, and Hungarian. Most of the population's religion is Roman Catholic. Before World War II Austria had a very large Jewish population. In Austria you are required to go to school from the ages of 6 to 15. After that you have a few choices for secondary school. You can choose to go to a school that prepares you to go to a technical college for specialized training in certain areas or you can go to a general high school and receive an education which allows you to continue on to a University. Austria is one of the world's top tourist destinations. Austria is a great winter sports area, and has many summer music festivals and lake resorts. One of the largest tourist attractions of Austria are the Alps. Most of the tourism that comes to Austria comes from Germany. 9% of Austria's money comes from tourism and it's the 9th biggest country for tourism in the world.

"Evaporation is when a liquid becomes a gas. When the molecules in a liquid are heated, they move faster. This makes them full of energy and so the particles collide with each other, and eventually they become so far apart that they become a gas. For example, a water left in a bowl will slowly disappear. The water evaporates into water vapor, the gas phase of water. The water vapor mixes with the air. Evaporation is a type of phase change in which matter changes from a liquid to a gas. Some liquids evaporate more quickly than others. Liquid with high boiling points (those that boil at very high temperatures) tend to evaporate more slowly than those with lower boiling temperatures. Water boils at around 100 degrees Celsius.(Boiling Point Of Water) There are many factors that affect the evaporation rate. Different liquids evaporate at different temperatures. For example, aluminum evaporates at 87 degrees Celsius. When water is evaporating, it transforms into a gas called water vapor. The reverse of evaporation is condensation. Evaporation is a very essential part of the water cycle. When water is boiling in a closed container, sometimes evaporation happens at the same time as condensation. Evaporation is vital in nature and is always the same as temperature and vapor pressure in nature. This means that if there is a lot of evaporation, the temperature goes down. Alternatively, if there is hardly any evaporation, there will be a temperature increase. The rate of evaporation are affected by the liquid's exposed surface area (faster when increased), the humidity of surroundings (slower when increased), the presence of wind (faster when increased) and the temperature (faster when increased).",Easy

"A playback singer is a singer whose work is recorded in advance as part of the soundtrack to a Bollywood or other similar type of film. The art of playback singing involves one or more singers performing a piece of work, which will be played over the top of the film. The actors and actresses on the screen lip sync to the song, so it looks like they are singing it, when in reality they're not. Sometimes this is done because it is cheaper for the film producers to have the whole soundtrack ready to go over the film, than it is to record it piece by piece during the production. Other times it may be done because the actor or actress playing the part in the film, cannot sing. Playback singers in the Indian film industries are very popular and are treated like celebrities, even though they're never seen in the films they have sung for. Some singers are household names across South Asia, such as Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Udit Narayan, Alka Yagnik, Mahendra Kapoor, Ahmed Rushdi and Mohammed Rafi.",Easy

"Ukraine is a country in eastern Europe. It is the second largest country in Europe, behind Russia. Its neighboring countries are Russia, Belarus, Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary, and Moldova. Ukraine is the largest all-European country and the 44th largest country in the world. The name Ukraine means border land in Ukrainian and Russian. The capital city is Kiev. Other big cities are L'viv, Kharkiv, and Odessa. Ukraine is not part of the European Union. The currency of Ukraine is the hryvnia. Although people have lived in Ukraine since 32,000 BCE, the country Ukraine is a fairly recent country. In the centuries before the 20th century, Ukraine was controlled by the Polish, Prussians and other groups of people. Like the majority of nations in Eastern Europe, Ukraine used to be part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) (between 1921 and 1991), or Soviet Union. Before that, Ukraine was part of the Russian Empire. As many as 10 million people died in a famine in Ukraine and other parts of the USSR in the 1930s and over 1 million were killed during World War 2. In 1986 Ukraine (and Belarus) suffered the world's worst nuclear accident when a reactor at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station exploded. Since the disaster over 4,000 people have developed cancer because of the radiation from the explosion. Ukraine became an independent country in 1991. In 2004, after protests against corrupt elections there was a revolution, known as the Orange Revolution which brought in a new government. In 2012 Ukraine and Poland will host the Euro 2012 football competition. Large protests against the government took place from November 2013 which resulted in another revolution in February 2014, which was accused by some of being supported by the CIA. This caused Russia to invade Crimea in the south of Ukraine and local people to vote to leave Ukraine and join Russia. Since the 2014 revolution parts of eastern Ukraine have been involved in conflicts against the government in Kiev with several hundred killed as of June 2014. In 2022, Ukraine was attacked by Russia. Ukraine is the largest country by area that is located entirely in Europe. Though Russia and Kazakhstan are larger, they aren't entirely in Europe. The total area of Ukraine is 603,700km2 (233,100 sq mi). Most of Ukraine has 4 very distinct seasons with warm summers and cold winters. Rainfall occurs more often in the summer months. Ukraine has a very wide variety of animals that live throughout the country. Most of the country is flat but there are mountains in the west. The highest mountain in Ukraine is Hora Hoverla at 2016 metres. The population of Ukraine is around 46,300,000. Ukrainians make up 73 percent of the population and Russians make up 22 percent of the population. The official language of the country is Ukrainian. Russian is also used within the country, especially in cities and the east. Most of the people in Ukraine are literate. Education is required for the ages 6 to 14. Most people in Ukraine are Christians - mainly Ukrainian Orthodox. There are small numbers of other Christians, Muslims and Jews living in the country. Because of historical cities, a coastline on the Black Sea and its close location to Russia, Poland and Germany, Ukraine is a popular holiday destination. 20 million tourists visit Ukraine every year. It is the 8th most visited country in Europe and has become more popular in recent years because EU citizens, Canadians, Americans (USA), Japanese and South Korean tourists no longer require visas to enter the country. The capital city of Kiev is popular for its churches, landscapes and Soviet architecture. L'viv, in the west, is popular because of its architecture, its Polish and Jewish history and its nightlife. Odessa, on the Black Sea coast, is also popular because of its diverse culture and location. There are five UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Ukraine. These include Saint-Sophia Cathedral in Kiev and the historic centre of L'viv. For a long time, the Ukraine had been a part of Soviet Union. In November 2013, protests (called Euromaidan) began in Ukraine in response to the former president Viktor Yanukovych's decision to not associate with the European Union. In February 2014, he fled Ukraine to Russia and was replaced by the interim president Oleksandr Turchynov and prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. In late February 2014, armed forces moved into Crimea, a territory in southern Ukraine. A referendum was performed to determine if Crimea would join Russia or remain part of Ukraine with more autonomy. According to the referendum, the majority of Crimea wanted to join Russia. However, western nations still consider it illegitimate because of the presence of armed forces. The government of Crimea then asked to join Russia. Currently, Crimea is controlled by Russia but still claimed by Ukraine. From March 2014, pro-Russian unrest continued in eastern Ukraine, mainly in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Pro-Russian forces took over many government and police buildings. Shortly after Petro Poroshenko was elected president on May 25, the Ukrainian military began to attempt to retake areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists. On July 17, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over the Donetsk Oblast, killing all on board. The plane was believed to be shot down by pro-Russian separatists. On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. The Invasion in the north was eventually repulsed, but the battle in southern Ukraine is still ongoing.

"The Flat Earth is the idea that the Earth is a flat motionless disk rather than a spinning ball, with some even saying it is a square. Educated people in Europe and the Middle East believed the earth was flat until around 300 B.C. People in India believed the Earth was flat until around the 3rd century. And people in China believed the earth was flat until around the 17th century. There is a myth that people believed the Earth was flat until Christopher Columbus sailed to America. The flat Earth myth first appeared in the 17th century when Protestants tried to make Catholics look stupid by saying Catholics believed the Earth was flat. Then in 1828, Washington Irving (who wrote ""Rip Van Winkle"" and ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"") wrote a biography about Christopher Columbus. In it, he said that people believed that Earth was flat and that Columbus believed it was round. The issue in the 1490s was not the shape of the Earth, but its size. Columbus thought the Earth was smaller than everyone else, and so he thought he could sail to India. Columbus was wrong and everyone else was right. Nobody knew about the Americas. Columbus was lucky and he didn't die at sea. Other anti-religious scholars started quoting Irving's biography as evidence that religious people were stupid. John William Draper and Andrew Dickson White wanted to portray science and religion as incompatible. Draper was a scientist who hated his sister, who was a Catholic nun. White got in fights with churches when he tried to create the non-religious Cornell University in New York. Because both Draper and White were highly educated and respected their teachings became very popular between 1870 and 1920. We now know that their books about religion and science were wrong. But many of their false teachings are still believed today, including the idea that people in the past believed the Earth was flat. Some also claim that certain phrases in the Bible teach the earth is flat, specifically phrases like ""the four corners of the earth"", ""ends of the earth"", and the earth's “pillars.” One could interpret this to mean the Earth is flat and would could also interpret this to be poetry and figurative language. Either way, the Bible doesn't talk about the shape of the Earth anywhere. And the Bible uses the word ""dragon"" several times and Christians knows that it isn't teaching that literal dragons exist. The flat Earth has seen a rise in belief in the 21st Century. Modern belief in the flat earth started in 1849. Samuel Rowbotham began lecturing and promoted the idea of a flat Earth in his book ""Zetetic Astronomy"". After Rowbotham died the Universal Zetetic Society was created and they kept the idea alive in their publications. In 1956, Samuel Shenton created the International Flat Earth Research Society. At one time there were 3,500 members. The group declined in 1997. In 2004, Daniel Shenton (not related to Samuel Shenton) resurrected the Flat Earth Society on the Internet. The society was officially relaunched in October 2009. Members of the society say that NASA and government agencies are deluding the public. The most popular flat Earth theory says that the world is a round disk, that the top of the Earth is in the center, and that Antarctica is not a continent but a large round wall that holds the oceans in like a dish. They say NASA is guarding the Antarctic ice wall and that NASA photoshops its satellite images. There is another way in which it has been proved that the earth is flat: if the earth were a rotating sphere, the stars would be in completely random places every night, and the north star would not be above the north pole every night.

"The scientific name is how species of any living organism are named by biologists. Is follows the binomial nomenclature, that is to say the name of a species is made of two parts: one indicating the genus and one indicating the species. Binomial nomenclature means ""two-part name"" or ""system of two-part names"". It is made of Latin words or at least Latinized words that are not real Latin and may come from another language. The person who popularized this system for use was Swedish botanist and physician Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778) who tried to name all things in the natural world and gave every species (animal, vegetable or mineral) that he knew a two-part name. This kind of naming had been used before Linnaeus, but before Linnaeus, almost nobody used binomial nomenclature. After Linnaeus, about everybody did. The value of the binomial nomenclature comes from its economy, its widespread use, and the uniqueness and stability of names in the system. The system replaced the use of Latin descriptive names, which were not handy as they were long (and growing all the time). An important reason for the stability of names is that they need not be descriptive. For example, Simmondsia chinensis has the component chinensis which means ""from China""; this was used in error, as the species is from California. Nevertheless, this name is used worldwide and is not to be 'corrected'. In today's system of naming, a name is just a label, and remains stable even if it is misdescriptive. Of course, ideally names should be descriptive; this makes it easier to remember them: Populus alba has leaves which are white underneath (alba means ""white""). The components of a name may come from any source whatsoever. Often they are Latin words, but they may also come from Ancient Greek, from a place, from a person, a name from a local language, etc. The names themselves are always treated grammatically as if they were a Latin sentence. This is why the name of a species is sometimes called its ""Latin name,"" but scientists like calling these names scientific names. The genus name must be unique inside each group of life. Species indicators need not be unique, but of course may not be used twice within the same genus.",Easy

"Victory Day in Bangladesh is an annual commemoration observed on December 16th, marking the historic occasion when the nation achieved independence from Pakistan in 1971. This day holds immense significance in the hearts of Bangladeshis, symbolizing the triumph of freedom, the spirit of resilience, and the sacrifices made during the Bangladesh Liberation War. The roots of Victory Day lie in the Bangladesh Liberation War, a conflict that took place from March 26, 1971, to December 16, 1971. The struggle for independence arose as a response to political and economic disparities between East and West Pakistan. The people of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) sought autonomy and self-determination, leading to a declaration of independence on March 26, 1971. The conflict intensified, resulting in widespread atrocities and the displacement of millions of people. The war concluded on December 16, 1971, with the Pakistani military's surrender to the joint forces of Bangladesh and India, marking the birth of the independent nation of Bangladesh. Victory Day is a national holiday in Bangladesh, celebrated with fervor and enthusiasm throughout the country. The day typically begins with the hoisting of the national flag and the singing of the national anthem. Various events and ceremonies are organized to pay tribute to the martyrs and freedom fighters. Parades, cultural programs, and patriotic songs are integral parts of the celebrations. The day also witnesses the awarding of honors to individuals who played significant roles during the Liberation War. The Jatiyo Sangsad Bhaban (National Parliament House) is illuminated, and the entire nation engages in remembering the sacrifices that led to the establishment of an independent Bangladesh. Victory Day is not only a historical milestone but also a testament to the cultural identity and resilience of the Bangladeshi people. The day fosters a sense of unity and pride, transcending generations as the nation reflects on its journey to independence. While Victory Day primarily commemorates the liberation from Pakistan, Bangladesh emphasizes peaceful coexistence and positive diplomatic relations.

"The Albert Hall (official name: Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences), is a large building in the City of Westminster, London. It was opened in 1871, by Queen Victoria. The hall is dedicated to her husband, Albert, Prince Consort, who had died ten years earlier. It is an auditorium where events are held. The Albert Hall is one of the most famous buildings in the world. Events like concerts for classical music or pop music, ballet, even tennis or boxing matches, or large ceremonies or parties or conferences. In the summer the BBC Proms take place there every day. The Royal Albert Hall has been holding concerts since 1941. In the early 19th century the whole area was still countryside. In 1851, there was a Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, just next to Kensington Park opposite where the RAH now stands. The exhibition building, called Crystal Palace, was a glass building which was just there for the exhibition. Prince Albert had the idea that public buildings should be built in the area for the arts and sciences. Some huge museums were built, including the Science Museum, Natural History Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum etc. When Prince Albert died in 1861 this plan had only just got started. The Royal Albert Hall was built and named after him. Queen Victoria laid the first stone. The Royal Albert Hall is very large. As many as 9,000 people used to get in, but now the safety rules make about 5,500 the usual number. It is round, like an Ancient Greek or Roman amphitheatre. This is why the floor area is called the “arena” (as in an amphitheatre). There is a very large glass and wrought-iron dome. It is 41m high. Round the outside, a little lower than the roof, there is a big mosaic frieze with pictures of ""The Triumph of Arts and Sciences"" and some writing in terracotta letters. It says that the first stone was laid by Her Majesty Queen Victoria on 20 May 1867 and was opened by her on 29 March 1871. It also has some words from the Bible. When Queen Victoria opened the building she was so emotional that she could not speak. Her son Edward, the Prince of Wales had to say her words for her. He said: ""The Queen declares this Hall is now open"". The hall has been used for lots of important events ever since 1871. Many of the seats are still owned by members of a Corporation which was called “the Corporation of the Hall of Arts and Sciences”. This group had been formed in 1866 as a charity to get money to build the hall. Its members still have a right to occupy 1,300 of the 5,200 seats. There was a problem with the sound because there was too much echo. It was not until 1969 that something was done about it. Big fibreglass dishes were hung from the ceiling. People who go to the RAH today call them “mushrooms” or sometimes “flying saucers”. They make music sound much better. There is a very large organ at the front of the hall. It was built by an organ maker called Henry Willis and was later rebuilt by Harrison & Harrison and most recently by Mander Organs; It is the biggest organ in the British Isles with 9,997 pipes. The Promenade Concerts which were started by Henry Wood in 1895 have taken place in the RAH ever since 1941 when the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombs in World War II. For two months there is at least one concert every day, and people can be seen queuing for standing tickets all the way down the steps towards Prince Consort Road. People who go to the proms today can choose between standing in the arena (the flat area downstairs), or sitting in the stalls (the seats around the side of the arena), or sitting in the Loggia Boxes, Second Tier Boxes, Circle (upstairs), Choir (where the choir sit if there is one, i.e. behind the orchestra) or standing in the gallery (at the very top). For some events such as tennis matches or ballets or operas the action takes place in the arena, so audience do not sit or stand there. During the last few years a lot of money has been spent on improving the Royal Albert Hall. The 1,800 seats in the balcony (now called the “Circle”) were very uncomfortable, so new seats were put in which are slightly bigger. The south entrance has been made into the main entrance (as it was years ago), with a porch to match the north entrance. The area south of the hall has been blocked off to traffic and pedestrianised. Dressing rooms (where artists change) are now on stage level instead of down in a basement. There is an underground car park and loading area so that lorries bringing things do not need to unload in the street and get in the way of the people.

"Historic Jamestowne is the site of the first permanent English settlement in the New World. It was established by the Virginia Company of London as ""James Fort"" on May 4, 1607 on the James River. It was briefly abandoned in 1610 with other settlements such as the Lost Colony of Roanoke. Jamestown served as the capital of the colony for 83 years, from 1616 until 1699. At first, the local native peoples welcomed and helped the British colonists. Relations with the natives deteriorated however. These people were annihilated in warfare within three years. Deaths of the colonists occurred in Jamestown due to starvation and disease. Over 80% of the colonists died in 1609-1610 in what became known as the ""Starving Time"". In the modern age, only archaeological ruins remain. In 2006, many preparations were underway for the Jamestown 2007 event celebrating the 400th anniversary of the settlement. Queen Elizabeth II visited Historic Jamestowne on May 4, 2007 — she had previously visited the park in October 1957.

"The theatre of ancient Greece is a literary genre. It was at its best from 550 to 220 BC. It was the beginning of modern western theatre, and some ancient Greek plays are still performed today. They invented the genres of tragedy (late 6th century BC), comedy (486 BC) and satyr plays. It is also, in the architectural sense, the place of theatre performance in ancient Greece... The city-state of Athens was a great cultural, political and military power during this period. Drama was at its centre. Theatre was part of a festival called the Dionysia, which honoured the god Dionysus. In the Dionysia, the playwrights presented their work to an audience. It was a competition, with a winner and prizes. These two main genres were never mixed: they each had their own typical structure. Athens exported the festival to its numerous colonies and allies in order to promote their way of life. Only men were allowed as actors. The chorus were men, as were the actors and the audience. Technically, they had to be citizens of Athens, which only applied to free-born men plus a few special cases. The actors wore masks, so that the people would know which persona (character) the actor played. The best known writers of plays are Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides for tragedies, and Aristophanes for comedies. Greek tragedy as we know it was made in Athens some years before 532 BC, when Thespis was the earliest recorded playwright. He won the first theatrical contest held at Athens, so he was the leader of the dithyrambs performed in and around Attica. Dithyrambs were ancient hymns sung in praise of the god of wine and fertility, Dionysus. They had a wild and ecstatic nature. By Thespis' time the dithyramb had evolved far away from its cult roots. It had become a narrative, ballad-like genre. Because of this Thespis is often called the ""Father of Tragedy"". The statesman Solon is said to have created poems in which characters speak with their own voice. Spoken recitations, known as rhapsodes, of Homer's epics were popular in festivals before 534 BC. Thespis's contribution to drama is unclear, but his name is remembered in the common term for performer—a 'thespian'. The dramatic performances were important to the Athenians – this is made clear by the Dionysian festival. The festival was created roughly around 508 BC. Phrynichus was the first poet known to use a historical subject – his Fall of Miletus, 493, told the fate of the town of Miletus after it was conquered by the Persians. He is also thought to be the first to use female characters (though not female performers). Until the Hellenistic period, all tragedies were unique pieces written in honour of Dionysus and played only once, so that today we only have the pieces that were still remembered well enough to have been repeated when repetition of old tragedies became fashion. After the Great Destruction of Athens by the Persians (Achaemenid Empire) in 480 BC, the town and acropolis were rebuilt, and theatre became an even more major part of Athenian culture and civic pride. The centre-piece was the competition between three tragic playwrights at the Theatre of Dionysus, twice a year. Each submitted three tragedies, plus a satyr play (a comic version of a mythological subject). From 486 BC, each playwright also submitted a comedy. Aristotle claimed that Aeschylus added the second actor, and that Sophocles introduced the third. Apparently the Greek playwrights never used more than three actors. Tragedy and comedy were viewed as completely separate genres, and no plays ever merged aspects of the two. Satyr plays dealt with the mythological subject matter of the tragedies, but in a purely comedic manner. However, as they were written over a century after the Athenian Golden Age, it is not known whether dramatists such as Sophocles and Euripides would have thought about their plays in the same terms. The power of Athens declined following its defeat in the Peloponnesian War against the Spartans. From that time on, the theatre started performing old tragedies again. Although its theatrical traditions seem to have lost their vitality, Greek theatre continued into the Hellenistic period (the period following Alexander the Great's conquests in the fourth century BC). The main Hellenistic theatrical form was not tragedy but 'New Comedy', comic episodes about the lives of ordinary citizens. The only playwright from the period whose work has survived is Menander. One of New Comedy's most important contributions was its influence on Roman comedy, an influence that can be seen in the surviving works of Plautus and Terence. The plays originally had a chorus of up to 50 people, who performed the plays in verse accompanied by music, beginning in the morning and lasting until the evening. The performance space was a simple semi-circular space, the orchestra, where the chorus danced and sang. The orchestra was on a flattened terrace at the foot of a hill, the slope of which produced a natural theatron, (watching place). Later, the term ""theatre"" came to be applied to the whole area of theatron, orchestra, and skené (scene). The theatres were built on a very large scale to accommodate the large number of people on stage, as well as the large number of people in the audience, up to fourteen thousand. Actors' voices needed to be heard throughout the theatre, including the very top row of seats. The Greeks' understanding of acoustics compares very favourably with the current state of the art. In 465 BC, the playwrights began using a backdrop or scenic wall, which hung or stood behind the orchestra, which also served as an area where actors could change their costumes. It was known as the skênê (scene). In 425 BC a stone scene wall, called a paraskenia, became a common supplement to skênê in the theatres. The proskenion (""in front of the scene"") was columned, and was similar to the modern day proscenium. Greek theatres also had entrances for the actors and chorus members called parodoi. They were tall arches that opened onto the orchestra, through which the performers entered. By the end of the 5th century BC, around the time of the Peloponnesian War, the skênê, the back wall, was two stories high. Some theatres also had a raised speaking place on the orchestra called the logeion. There were several scenic elements commonly used in Greek theatre: Although in the early days the chorus was much larger, the numbers settled down to 12 or 15 in tragedies and 24 in comedies. They usually play a group character, such as 'the old men of Argos'. The chorus offers background information, summaries and comments. In many of these plays, the chorus expresses to the audience what the main characters cannot say, such as their hidden fears or secrets. The chorus might sing, or might speak in unison (say the same thing together). The chorus made up for the fact that there were only one, two or three actors, who played several parts each (changing masks). Before the introduction of several actors by Aeschylus, the Greek chorus was the main performer opposite a solitary actor. The importance of the chorus declined after the 5th century BC, when the chorus began to be separated from the dramatic action. Later dramatists depended less on the chorus. The mask is known to have been used since the time of Aeschylus in the 6th century AD. It is one of the feathure classical Greek theatre. Masks were also used in the worship of Dionysius, and that is probably how the tradition started. Most of the evidence comes from a few vase paintings of the 5th century BC which depict actors preparing for a Satyr play. No physical evidence survived: the masks were made of organic materials. They were not considered permanent objects, and were dedicated to the altar of Dionysus after performances. There are, however, examples of statues of actors carrying a mask in hand. Masks were made for the actors and the chorus, who help the audience know what a character is thinking. The chorus all wear the same mask, because they represent the same character. In a large open-air theatre, like the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens, the masks brought the characters' face closer to the audience, as they had exaggerated features and expressions. An actor could appear and reappear in different roles, since the audience did not identify the actor with one character. Their variations help the audience to distinguish sex, age, and social status. Also, they could show a change in a character's appearance, for example, Oedipus after blinding himself.p70 Unique masks were also created for specific characters and events in a play, such as The Furies in Aeschylus’ Eumenides and Pentheus and Cadmus in Euripides’ The Bacchae. Worn by the chorus, the masks created a sense of unity and uniformity, a sort of multi-voiced persona or single organism.",Easy

"A conspiracy is when there is a lot of people who are working on something in secret and they don't tell anybody about. It can also be a lie that starts as just an idea or a rumour, in order to trick people into doing something. It is also called a conspiracy theory, because sometimes it is just an idea that is not true and that is very difficult to prove or disprove because if it was true then it is supposed to be a secret, which provides an excuse for the lack of proof. There have been many conspiracies in the history of the world and they are usually connected to people trying to take things from other people without the other people noticing until it is too late. There are a lot of conspiracy theories because anybody can make one up and it because it is supposed to be secret. A good example is the word tank. Today everybody knows that a tank is a vehicle with a turret on it, a cannon, but when the first tanks were built, they didn't want people to know that they are building weapons, so they said that they are building water tanks.

"The Labors of Herakles is a series of tasks performed by the Greek hero Herakles. He had committed a terrible crime and these tasks were a form of penance. They involved killing fierce animals and horrible monsters. The Labors were devised by Hera, the Queen of Heaven and the goddess of marriage. She hated Herakles because he was a bastard son of her husband Zeus. She hoped these tasks would kill him. Herakles however performed the Labors with great success, and became very famous. The Labors of Herakles probably had their origin in the religious and magical practices of prehistoric man. Mortals die, but gods live forever. Herakles was part mortal, part god. His father was the god Zeus and his mother was the mortal Alkmene. Zeus' wife Hera was the Queen of Heaven and the goddess of marriage. She hated Herakles because he was one of her husband's bastards. She tried many times to kill him, even when he was a baby. He survived in spite of Hera's persecution and hatred, and did many great deeds as a young man. Herakles married Megara, the daughter of a king. They became the parents of several children. Hera caused Herakles to go mad, and to kill his family. The priestess of Delphi ordered Herakles to serve his cousin King Eurystheus of Tiryns as a penance for this crime. Eurystheus would present a series of tasks to Herakles. These tasks were designed by Hera herself in the hope that they would kill Herakles. There is no definite order for the Labors. Most of the time, however, the order is: Nemean Lion, Lernean Hydra, the Golden Hind, Erymanthian Boar, Augean Stables, Stymphalian Birds, Cretan Bull, the Mares of Diomedes, Girdle of Hippolyta, Cattle of Geryon, Apples of the Hesperides, and Kerberos. The order here is that of the sculptures on the Temple of Zeus at Olympia. These sculptures (made about 460 - 450 BC) were placed high on the outside of the temple. Their order was described by the ancient Greek geographer, Pausanias. Some of these metopes are used in this article to illustrate the Labors. The first group of six metopes are from the west end of the temple. The second group of six are from the east end. Some of the illustrations here are taken from Greek vase paintings. The Labours of Herakles became the subject of much ancient and modern art, and even movies such as Hercules (1958) starring bodybuilder Steve Reeves and the Walt Disney animated movie Hercules (1997). A large and dangerous lion was terrorizing the people and animals near the city of Nemea. Weapons of iron, bronze, or stone could not pierce the lion's thick hide (skin). Eurystheus ordered Herakles to kill and skin this lion. Herakles went to the region of Nemea and stayed with a poor man named Molorchos at Kleonai. Molorchos' son had been killed by this lion. Molorchos wanted to sacrifice his only ram to Herakles, but Herakles asked him to wait thirty days. If he did not return within thirty days, the ram was to be sacrificed to him as a hero. If he returned within thirty days, the ram was to be sacrificed to Zeus the Deliverer. Herakles found the lion outside its lair on Mount Tretos. His arrows and sword were useless against the beast. He hit the lion with his club and the animal went into his lair. Herakles blocked one of the two openings to the cavern with nets, then entered the cavern. He wrestled the lion and choked it to death. The lion bit off one of his fingers. He returned to Molorchos' hovel with the lion's carcass on his back. The two men sacrificed to Zeus. When Herakles presented the dead animal to Eurystheus, the king was disgusted. He ordered Herakles to leave such things outside the gates of Tiryns in the future. Eurystheus then put a large bronze jar underground. This was the place where he would hide whenever Herakles returned to the city with some trophy of his Labors. Zeus put the lion among the stars as the constellation Leo. In the future, Eurystheus would only communicate with Herakles through Kopreus, his dungman. Herakles skinned the lion with one of its own claws. He wore the skin as a kind of armor and the lion's skull as a helmet. Euripides wrote in his play Herakles:""First he cleared the grove of Zeus of a lion, and put its skin upon his back, hiding his yellow hair in its fearful tawny gaping jaws."" The origin of the Nemean Lion is not certain. Some say he was the son of either Typhon or the Chimera and the dog Orthros. Some say the moon goddess Selene gave birth to the lion and let it fall to Earth near a two-mouthed cave at Nemea. She set it against the people because they had failed to properly observe her worship. Some say that Hera had Selene create the lion from sea foam and that Iris, the goddess of the rainbow, carried it to Nemea. Others say the lion was the son of the snake goddess Echidna and her son, the dog Orthos. This would make the lion a brother to the Sphinx of Thebes. Hera was said to have brought the lion from the eastern land of the Arimoi and to have released it near Nemea. The Hydra (""water-snake"") was a monster with many heads. She lived beneath a tree near the seaside city of Lerna. The Hydra had a dog-like body. Its breath was poisonous. The head in the middle of the monster was immortal. It could not die. Eurystheus ordered Herakles to kill this monster. Herakles and his nephew Iolaos drove to the swamp near Lerna in Herakles' war chariot. Athena told Herakles to force the monster from the swamp with fire arrows. He did, but the monster twisted itself about his feet. He beat the heads with his club, but crushing one head only caused others to erupt. A great crab crawled from the swamp to help the Hydra. It bit Herakles in the foot. He crushed its shell. Herakles called Iolaos for his help and cut the Hydra's heads off with his sword. Iolaos sealed the neck stumps with torches so other heads could not grow in their place. At last, the Hydra was killed. Herakles cut off the immortal head and buried it under a heavy stone in the road. He dipped his arrowheads in the Hydra's poisonous blood. They became deadly. Back in Tiryns, Eurystheus would not count this adventure as a Labour, because Herakles had had his nephew's help. He added another Labour to the list. Hera set the crab in the sky as a constellation. The Stymphalian Birds were man-eating birds living on the shores of Lake Stymphalos in north-eastern Arcadia. The birds were sacred to Ares, the god of war. Their feces poisoned the land and crops would not grow. The birds attacked men with their bronze beaks and claws. They could rain down their sharp bronze feathers to kill men and their animals. Herakles failed to drive them off with his arrows. Athena gave him a set of metal castanets (or a rattle) made by the blacksmith of the gods, Hephaestus. Herakles climbed to a rocky place over the lake and made so much noise with the castanets that the birds flew as far as the Isle of Ares in the Black Sea. Herakles was able to kill many of them with his arrows as they flew away. Some say the birds were women. Artemis Stymphalia ruled the swamps about the lake. Her temple there had pictures of young girls with the feet of birds. These girls lured men to their deaths in the swamps. They were said to be the daughters of Stymphalos and Ornis. These two were killed by Herakles when they would not give him food, drink, and a place to rest. The Cretan Bull rose from the sea. Poseidon, god of the sea, intended King Minos to sacrifice the bull, but it was so handsome that Minos kept it for himself. He sent it to mate with his cows, then sacrificed another bull to Poseidon. The god was angry and caused Minos' wife, Queen Pasiphaë, to develop a sexual desire for the animal. She mated with it and gave birth to a son. This son was the Minotaur, a monster with the head of a bull and the body of a man. The Cretan Bull went mad. Heracules captured it by throwing a rope about its head and about a leg. Some say he wrestled it, or stunned it with his club. Minos let Heracules take the bull to Greece. Eurystheus wanted to give the bull to Hera but she would not take it because Heracules had captured it. She let it go and it wandered about Greece. Theseus of Athens finally captured it and sacrificed it to Athena, or some say, Apollo. The bull had spent its days in Crete destroying crops and belching fire. When Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, was a child, she saw five hinds (female deer) grazing near the Anaurus River in Thessaly. Each was as large as a bull, each had hooves of bronze, and all had antlers of gold. She caught four of them, and used them to pull her chariot. The fifth escaped the goddess and lived on the Keryneian Hill in Arkadia. Hera planned to use this hind against Herakles someday. Eurystheus ordered Herakles to catch this hind and bring it alive to Tiryns. The danger in this Labor lay in pursuing the hind through wild lands from which no hunter ever returned. Herakles hunted the hind for a year, chasing it through Istria and the Land of the Hyperboreans. The hind took refuge on Mount Artemision. Herakles let fly an arrow that pinned the hind's forelegs (front legs) together without drawing blood. He put the hind on his shoulders and took her back to Tiryns. Artemis and Apollo stopped Herakles on his way to Tiryns. On some vases, Apollo is seen trying to forcibly take the hind from Herakles. Herakles however lay the blame for the theft on Eurystheus. Artemis accepted this plea and allowed him to pass. Some say Herakles used a net to capture the hind or captured her when she was asleep under a tree. Eurystheus' daughter Admete was a priestess of Hera. She wanted the Golden Girdle (belt) of Hippolyte, the Queen of the Amazons. This girdle had been a gift to Hippolyte from her father, Ares, the god of war. The Amazons were all related to Ares. They hated men and mated only to make more female warriors. Baby boys were killed or crippled. The lives of these women were devoted to war. Herakles and friends sailed to their land of Pontos on the Black Sea. The Amazons lived at the mouth of the Thermodon River. Hippolyte welcomed Herakles. She fell in love with his muscles and his great fame. She promised him the girdle as a love token. Hera disguised herself as an Amazon. She whispered among others that Herakles was going to kidnap the Queen. The Amazons charged Herakles' ship on horseback. Herakles killed Hippolyte, and took the girdle. Many Amazons were killed. Some say Hippolyte would not part with the girdle. Herakles threw her from her horse and threatened her with his club. She would not ask for mercy. Herakles killed her. Some say Hippolyte's sister Melanippe was taken prisoner. She was ransomed with the girdle. Some say Hippolyte herself was taken prisoner and ransomed with the girdle. Others say Theseus took Hippolyte prisoner and gave the girdle to Herakles. Herakles gave the girdle to Eurystheus, who gave it to Admete. A large and dangerous boar was living on Mount Erymanthos. Eurystheus ordered Herakles to catch this boar. On Mount Erymanthos, Herakles forced the boar from the wood with his shouts. He then drove the boar into deep snow and jumped on its back. He put the boar in chains, placed it on his shoulders, and took it to Eurystheus. The king was so scared he hid in his bronze jar. Herakles left the boar in the market square of Tiryns. He then joined the Argonauts on the Quest for the Golden Fleece. Mount Erymanthos took its name from a son of Apollo. Aphrodite blinded him because he saw her taking a bath. Apollo was angry. He turned himself into a boar and killed her boyfriend Adonis. Eurystheus ordered Herakles to bring him the Horses of King Diomedes of Thrace. King Diomedes' horses were savage man-eaters, and were fed on the flesh of Diomedes' innocent guests. Herakles and his friends sailed to the coast of Thrace. Having found the stables of Diomedes, they killed the king's servants. They then put Diomedes before the horses. The animals tore him to pieces and ate him. The horses grew calm after feeding, and were led to the ship. Herakles sent them to Eurystheus. Diomedes was the son of Ares, the god of war, and the king of the Bistones, a Thracian tribe of warlike people. While travelling in connection with this Labor, Herakles visited King Admetos. His wife Alcestis had just died. Herakles wrestled Death for Alcestis and he won. Alcestis was returned to life. This event is the basis for Euripides' play Alcestis. Eurystheus dedicated the savage horses to Hera. They were said to have bred into the age of Alexander the Great. Another story says Herakles captured the horses and drove them to his ship. Diomedes and his men chased the thieves. Herakles and his friends left the ship to fight the king and his men. The horses of Diomedes were left in the care of Abderos, Herakles' male lover. The horses ate him. Herakles built the city of Abdera in his memory. It was after this Labor that Herakles joined the Quest for the Golden Fleece. He dropped out of the search when his lover Hylas was lost on a strange island. Some say Herakles went on to Kolchis and rejoined the Quest. Others say he returned to Tiryns and the Labors. Geryon was a very strong giant with three bodies, six hands, and three heads. He was the King of Tartessus in Spain. He had wings, and the picture on his shield was an eagle. He lived on an island called Erytheia. This island was far to the west in Okeanos, the river that circles the Earth. At night, the Sun sailed upon this river in a Golden Cup. Geryon had large herds of cattle. They were watched over by Eurytion, Geryon's servant, and a huge two-headed dog named Orthrus, the offspring of Typhon and Echidna. King Eurystheus ordered Herakles to capture Geryon's cattle. Herakles crossed the Libyan desert. At the narrow channel that separates Europe and Africa, he built the Pillars of Herakles. The Sun was hot and Herakles threatened to shoot him with his bow and arrows. The Sun asked him not to do this. Herakles agreed. He borrowed the Sun's Golden Cup and sailed away in it. The Titan Oceanus tested Herakles' seamanship by causing violent waves. Herakles threatened to shoot Oceanus, too. Oceanus calmed the waves. Some say Herakles sailed in an urn and used his lion skin as a sail. On Geryon's island, Herakles killed the two-headed dog Orthos and the servant Eurytion, who tried to help the dog. Herakles was driving the cattle to the Golden Cup when Geryon appeared, ready to fight. Herakles shot him down and sailed away with the cattle. Herakles had many adventures on his return to Greece. On the Greek coast, Hera sent gadflies to drive the herd of cattle far and wide. Herkales managed to round-up a few and these he presented to Eurystheus. He sacrificed them to Hera. Hera received golden apples as a gift when she married. She planted them in her garden far to the west near Mount Atlas. It was on this mountain that the Titan Atlas held the sky on his shoulders. He was being punished for having joined the other Titans in making war on Zeus. When Hera heard his daughters were stealing from the garden, she sent a one hundred-headed dragon called Ladon to the garden to protect the apples. Three nymphs called the Hesperides also guarded the apples. Eurystheus wanted Herakles to bring him three golden apples. Herakles set off. The river god Nereus refused to give him directions and changed his shape again and again. Herakles tied him to a tree until he told the way. In the Caucasus, Herakles freed the Titan Prometheus, the fire-bringer, from his chains. Prometheus warned Herakles not to pick the apples himself, but to ask someone else to do it. Herakles asked Atlas to pick the apples. The Titan agreed, but only if Herakles would kill the dragon and then take the sky on his shoulders. Herakles killed the dragon and took the sky on his shoulders. Atlas picked the apples but refused to take the sky again. He liked being free. Herakles tricked him. He asked Atlas to take the sky— only for a moment— while he put a cushion on his shoulders. Atlas took the sky. Herakles took the apples and headed for Tiryns. Eurystheus did not know what to do with the apples. He gave them to Herakles. Athena returned the apples to the garden, because they did, after all, belong to the gods. Eurystheus ordered Herakles to bring him Kerberos, a three-headed dog-like monster with a dragon's tail and a mane of poisonous snakes. It guarded the entrance to the Underworld. The three heads could see the past, present, and future. Some say they represented birth, youth, and old age. Kerberos allowed the dead to enter the Underworld, but anyone who tried to leave was eaten. Kerberos was the offspring of Echidna, a monster part womanpart snake, and Typhon, a fire-breathing giant. Kerberos' brother was the two-headed dog Orthrus. Herakles' first step was to undergo the Mysteries of Eleusis. These rites would protect him in the land of the dead. They would also cleanse him of the massacre of the Centaurs. Athena and Hermes guided Herakles into the Underworld. He was ferried across the River Styx in Charon's boat. On the opposite shore, he met the Gorgon, Medusa. She was a harmless phantom and he passed her without trouble. He met Meleagros and offered to marry his sister, Deianeira. Eventually, he did. When Herakles asked Hades for Kerberos, Hades allowed him to take the monster, but only if he could do so without using his weapons. Herakles wrestled the monster and choked it. Once the monster had yielded, he led it away. As they neared the Earth's surface, Kerberos tossed his three heads because he hated the sunlight. His spit flew in all directions. From that spit grew the poisonous plant, aconite. When Heracles arrived in Tiryns, Eurystheus was performing a sacrifice. The king gave the best cuts of meat to his relatives and only a slave's portion of meat to Herakles. Herakles was furious with this insult and killed Eurystheus' three sons. Eurystheus was terrified when presented with Kerberos and hid in his bronze jar. Herakles took Kerberos back to the Underworld. Another account says the monster escaped. This Labor is the twelfth and last Labor in some accounts. King Augeias of Elis lived on the west coast of the Peloponnese. He was a son of Helios, the sun god. It was said that the rays of the sun shone in his eyes. Augeias had many cattle. His animals were always healthy, and gave birth to many young. His stables had not been cleaned in years and were thick with animal waste. The valleys were also full of waste. The smell of this waste poisoned the land. Eurystheus ordered Herakles to clean the stables in a day. He liked the thought of Herakles doing such dirty work. Herakles went to Elis. He did not tell Augeias that Eurystheus had ordered him to clean the stables.Instead, he made a bargain with Augeias. He promised to clean the stables if Augeias would give him some of his cattle. The bargain was made. Augeias' son Phyleos acted as witness. Herakles set to work. First, he made two holes in the stone foundation of the stables. Then he changed the paths of the Alpheios and Peneios Rivers. The rivers were made to flow through one hole and out the other. This is how the stables were washed clean. Augeias learned from Eurystheus' servant Copreus that Eurystheus had ordered Herakles to clean the stables. He would not respect the bargain he had made with Herakles. Herakles took the case to court. Phyleos was called to court and told the truth about the bargain. Augeias was so angry he drove his son and Herakles out of the land. Back in Tiryns, Eurystheus said that the Labor did not count because Herakles had made a bargain with Augeias. Eurystheus also thought that the river gods had really done the work. This Labor was the last one presented in the frieze on the Temple of Zeus at Olympia. It was important to the Greeks because one day Herakles made war on Augeias and defeated him. Herakles then laid out the Olympian sanctuary in the land of King Augeias and started the Olympic Games. It was said that Menedemus of Elis gave Herakles advice on this Labor and that the hero had the help of his nephew Iolaos. While Augeias and Herakles were making their bargain, Phaeton, one of Augeias' twelve white bulls, charged Herakles. These white bulls guarded all the cattle against wild animals. Phaeton thought the hero was a lion. Herakles forced the bull to the Earth by twisting its horn. Herakles was going to get Augeias' daughter as part of the bargain, but he did not. This was given as one reason for making war later on Augeias. He was also going to become Augeias' slave if the work was not done in one day.",Easy

"Sleep is important for our body and ""soul"". We do not yet know exactly why we have to sleep. But there is no question that sleeping is useful. Those who cannot sleep at all or who are forcibly prevented from sleeping become ill and can die. During the day, our brain in particular is flooded with lots of different things. Sleep is the time to recharge your batteries, sort everything and store important memories in your mind. Some bodily functions continue to run even while sleeping: breathing, heartbeat, digestion and others. There are two types of sleep that alternate several times during the night: deep sleep and REM sleep. Blood pressure and body temperature drop during deep sleep. Sometimes the muscles move. Then we turn around in our sleep. Our brain is active during REM sleep. The eyes move back and forth quickly. REM is the abbreviation for rapid eye movement. During REM sleep, the body becomes almost stiff. For some people, this doesn't happen, and they can sleepwalk. Our dreams also come in REM sleep. In the dream the brain sorts different images, sounds and feelings. One can see something in a dream without really seeing, hear something without really hearing, or run without really running. Only in this part of sleep do these noticeable and rapid eye movements occur. Children usually sleep longer than adults. A newborn sleeps up to 18 hours a day. Most animals also need to sleep. In some animal species, only one half of the brain sleeps. Only one eye is closed so that the surroundings can still be perceived. Animals such as horses can sleep standing up because their brains do this too, so that if they're scared, they can quickly wake and run away.",Easy

"The violin is a string instrument that is played with a bow. The violin has four strings, which are tuned to the notes, G, D, A, and E. The violin is held between the left collar bone (near the shoulder) and the chin. Different notes are made by fingering, with the left hand while bowing with the right. It has no frets or other markers, so players have to learn the exact place to put the fingers of the left hand by memory alone. The violin is the smallest and highest pitched instrument in the string family. The other instruments in the family are: viola, cello and double bass. A person who plays the violin is called a violinist. A person who makes or repairs a violin is called a luthier. The violin is about 400 years old. By the time the modern orchestra started in the 17th century the violin was fully developed and it became the most important orchestral instrument. It is used as a solo instrument, in chamber music, in orchestral music and in jazz as well as in folk music. The violin was more like the medieval rebec which was an instrument held under the chin and bowed. In the 16th century there was an instrument called the lira da braccio, which was an early form of the violin. In the 17th century there were several families of luthiers who were extremely good at making instruments. The most famous violin makers were Stradivarius, Amati and Guarneri. Some of the instruments that these luthiers made are still in existence today. They are some of the best instruments in existence, and can fetch prices of several million dollars. The biggest part of the violin is the wooden body. It is made of spruce. Many violins also have a chinrest. This helps to hold the violin against the player's shoulder. A shoulder rest is also used. These are now made of foam, with special legs to hold them on to the violin. As these are not particularly cheap, many beginners instead use a sponge and an elastic band. To make it easier to tune the violin, many people find it helpful to have “adjusters” for “fine tuning” when the string is only slightly out of tune. These adjusters go through holes in the tailpiece. Strings used to be made of gut, but now they are mostly made of steel or nylon. Adjusters can only be used with steel strings. The bow can be made of several kinds of wood, for example pernambuco. Some players today use bows made of carbon fibre. The bow is strung with horsehair. As with most instruments, it takes years of practice to become a really good violinist. Beginners start by practicing on the “open strings” (without using the left-hand fingers). At first the beginner can pluck the strings, then he or she can learn how to use the bow. Gradually the player can learn how to stop the strings with the fingers to get all the different notes. At first the learner will play in “first position”. This means that finger 1 (the fingers are numbered from 1 to 4, the thumb being behind the neck of the instrument) is playing a note which is a whole tone above the open string, e.g. on the D string it is playing a stopped E. When he or she is more advanced they will play in other positions by moving the left hand up the fingerboard nearer to the bridge. There is also a half position in which the first finger is stretched back. The violinist has to learn to put the fingers in exactly the right place so that the music is “in tune” (this is called intonation). He will also learn vibrato. Besides plucking (pizzicato) there are many special effects such as glissando, portamento and harmonics as well as double stopping, chords or using scordatura tuning. The violin can be played either standing or sitting down. When playing solo music the violinist normally stands, but when playing in chamber music or in orchestras he sits (although this was not always the case). When sitting he may have to turn his right leg in so that it does not get in the way of the bow. In the 17th and 18th centuries composers wrote a lot of music for solo violin. Many of these composers were from Italy and were themselves violinists: Corelli, Vitali, Vivaldi, Veracini, Geminiani, Locatelli and Tartini. In Germany, Schmelzer and Biber wrote some very virtuoso violin music. Later, in the early 18th century, Bach and Handel wrote many masterpieces for the violin. In the Classical music period the great composers Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all wrote solo works for the violin as well as a vast amount of chamber music, especially string quartets. In the Romantic period many virtuoso violin works were written. These include concertos by Mendelssohn, Saint-Saëns, Brahms, Bruch, Wieniawski, Tchaikovsky, Dvořák. In the 19th century Niccolò Paganini was undoubtedly the most famous violinist. He composed and played violin music that was harder than anyone had played before. People compared him to the devil because he could play so brilliantly (and because of his looks). In the 20th century Elgar, Sibelius, Szymanowski, Bartók, Stravinsky, Berg, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Hindemith and Penderecki. In recent years the violin has also been used in jazz playing. Stephane Grappelli was especially famous for this. Some of the most famous violinists of the last century are Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz, David Oistrakh, Yehudi Menuhin, Ida Haendel and Isaac Stern. Today some of the greatest players include Itzhak Perlman, Maxim Vengerov, Vadim Repin, Nigel Kennedy, Hilary Hahn, Joshua Bell, and the fiddler Sara Watkins.",Easy

"A flower is the reproductive organ of some plants: the plants that make flowers are called flowering plants. Most known flowers are usually beautiful and brightly coloured: this is because, since plants don't move, they have to attract insects (like bees, or butterflies, so they carry their pollen for them; some other kinds of flowers don't use insects, but wind, and are less coloured, because wind don't need to be attracted! A flower is usually compound of the following elements: Pistil is placed at the center of the flower, surrounded by stamina, that are surrounded by petals, that are surrounded by sepals. This general pattern may vary from one flower to another. In order to become a seed, the ovary in the pistil has to be fertilized by a grain of pollen. If so, the ovary turn to a seed, while the pistil (that contains the ovary) will become a fruit, that will contains the seed. This means that pollen has to arrive from a stamen to the pistil. Moreover, in many plants, this can't be a pollen grain from the same flower, it has to be from a different one! Problem is that plants (and, thus, flowers) don't move: they have to ""find"" a way to have their pollen carried from the stamina to the pistil. Many ways exist, that lead to different kinds of flowers organisations: Most flowers have both male (stamina) and female (pistil) organs, they are called hermaphrodite; but some plants bear two kinds of different flowers, male ones, with only stamina (and no pistil), and female ones, with only pistil (and no stamina). Some plants even bear only one kind (either male or female) of flowers: there are then male and female flowers, and both are then needed to have fertilisation. This bee is so busy collecting pollen on this dahlia flower, that it didn't notice that its hair are covered with pollen grains that stuck on it. When it will visit the next flower, some of these pollen grains will probably fall on the pistil, and fertilize it. Bees are not the only one to visit flowers... This butterfly, a red admiral, a much to do, with foraging each of these flowers with its long proboscis, to get the drop of nectar that is laid inside. While doing this, it covers itself with pollen that it will cary to the next flower. This plant attracts so many butterflies, as the red admiral, with its exquisite flowers, that it is called a butterfly bush. as its name indicates, the bee orchid's flower looks like a bee. More accurately, a female bee, and it even smells like one. Whenever a male bee sees it and try to copulate with it, it covers itself with pollen, that it will carry to the next flower it will visit.]] The nectar of these flowers seems to be a delicacy for this green violetear, a tiny hummingbird. Depending on the way they are pollinated, many kinds of flowers can exist: Flowers pollinated by insects (or other animals) have to be found by the animal from far away: they exhibit bright colours: most often, the petals are big, and full of colours, but, in some cases, this is the sepals that are coloured, or even both, as in tulips: in this case, in it almost impossible to see difference between petals and sepals, except by examinating wich ones is placed around the others: both petals and sepals are then called tepals. To attract insects, these flowers don't have only the vision: petals are not only big, and coloured, they also produce a sweet, sugared, liquid, called nectar, and emit fragrance. This is why flowers usually smell good. Some rare orchid flowers are pollinated by bats, that use echolocation to get its bearing; this flowers have special shaped petals, that reverberate the sounds emit by the bat, so the flower ""indicates"" its position to the bat by the sound! In the other hand, the flowers that are pollinated by the wind don't need to have big petals to be seen from far away, since the wind don't see; furthermore, such kinds of petals would in fact be disability, by stopping the wind. Flowers that are pollinated by the wind usually have greenish, short petals and sepals,or even no petals at all. They are usually less ""beautifull"" (because less coloured). They have long stamina and pistil that swing in the wind. This tulip is brighly coloured, but will you be able to see the difference between petals (inner) and sepals (outer)? They're so similar that in this case both are called ""tepals"". the bougainvillea flowers are tiny and white, but they are surrounded by great, brightly coloured, pinkish or purple leaves, to make sure the insects won't miss it. the barren bromegrass flowers are pollinated by the wind. They are greenish, with no petals nor sepals, and very long stamina and pistil. Flowers are usually beautiful and smell good... But don't forget that this is only by ""accident"", since plants don't try to please us, but rather the bees and butterflies that pollinate them. Luckily, it seems that what a bee or a butterfly like, in terms of fragance and colour, we like to... Problem is, not all flowers are pollinated by bees or butterflies... The rare flower Rafflesia arnoldi, that only thrives in the islands of Java and Sumatra, in Indonesia, is pollinated by flies, and so it try to please them, in order to attract them... This is why it is all warty, dark reddish coloured, and stincks a foul odour of rotten meat... The stench is so strong, that flies come from far away, attracted by the flower, and can carry the pollen from one flower to another. This really strange flower also holds a record: its is the biggest, and heaviest flower in the World. While many flowers use to have only one flower, at the edge of the stem, many other have various ones, arranged in a special pattern called an inflorescence. While some plants have big flowers, others have smaller ones, gathered to be seen easily from a distance. In some case, inflorescence might be very complex. Some inflorescences look like a single flower, when seen from far away. The Martagon lily flowers are disposed on the stem, in a pattern called a raceme. At first sight, these daisies seem to have white petals surrounding a yellow core. But let's look closer... Un fact, the ""core"" is made of hundreds of yellow tiny flowers, surrounded by greater, white ones with huge petals. In human culture, flower are one of the symbol of beauty. Interestingly, almost every human culture on Earth consider flowers as beautiful. Flowers are picked, and gathered to make a bunch, called a bouquet. Men often offer bunches to ladies, that keep it in a vase. In many occasions, bunches play a special role. For example, the wedding bouquet, that is tossed during the celebration. The ikebana is the Japanese art of crafting elaborate flower bouquets. A bride, with her bouquet, at her wedding.",Easy

"Phishing on the Internet is the act of fraudulently collecting personal information from someone, such as usernames and passwords, credit card information, etc. Fraudsters use this method to steal information from people by setting up a well-established website. Phishing is usually done via email and instant messaging. Fraudsters somehow trick their victims into taking them to their website. The website mimics the look of the original website of the concerned user's email, bank or credit card. When users think of it as a real site and provide their own information, that information falls into the hands of fraudsters. Phishing is an example of a fraudulent strategy called social engineering. Legislation to prevent phishing, user training, public awareness, and technical prevention are now being developed. The method of phishing was first described in 1986. The term phishing was first used in 1997. It originated as a corruption of the English word fishing or fishing. .

"The Convention on the Rights of the Child is an international treaty whose objective is to establish and ensure the children's rights. It was adopted the 20th of November, 1989 by the United Nations General Assembly. This assembly brings together the representatives of each member states of the United Nations. The Convention was then signed and ratified by most of the countries in the world. They promise thus one to every other to follow this text. It follows the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, (which only was a United Nations resolution) which was adopted 30 years sooner and containing 10 articles called ""principles"". The text of the Convention on the Rights of the child can be found notably: The idea of a statement on the rights of the child which has the value of an international treaty had been present for several years but it was the Polish government who took the initiative of this work and proposed to the UN in 1978 the first version of the convention. Poland was the country of origin of Janusz Korczak (died in 1942), who had think over, put into practice and written about the rights of the child. The representatives from Poland who proposed the project quoted Korczak and were inspired by his work. The year 1979 was declared the ""International Year of the Child"" by the UN that accepted and supported the project. Delegates of the voluntary countries formed a working group to prepare the agreement, the project is also followed by several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and institutions under the UN such as UNICEF and the Commission on Human Rights. Starting on 1979 until the convention's adoption, the work group, whose expenses are paid by the ONU, had an office for secretarial work at Geneva in Switzerland and it met twice a year, gathering the delegates of about 40 countries in the world. It was necessary that the text was adapted and acceptable by very different countries, at the same time being useful and effective This work lasted 10 years. After the text has been modified and completed during this period, it was adopted November 20, 1989, exactly 30 years after the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. The convention entered into force (became valid) on the 2nd September 1990, one month after 20 countries had already ratified it. It was signed and ratified quickly compared to the other conventions of the UN, and by a vast majority of the countries. Today all the countries of the world except three have signed and ratified it, sometimes with reservations on a particular article. Only the United States, Somalia and the South Sudan have not ratified it. The United States often delays signing treaties that they thinks possibly restrictive, but the intention to ratify the convention is still ongoing. Somalia is in a difficult political situation and South Sudan is a country which only obtained its independence in 2011. The Convention concerning the Rights of Children contains of a ""preamble"" and 54 articles in three parts. The first 41 talk about the rights themselves, the 2nd part talks about their enactment and the necessary resources to check it while the 3rd part arranges its legal enactment: that is to say when the convention enters into force once signed and ratified by the countries (the word convention stands for agreement or treaty) and how it can be amended or rounded off. The definition of child for the enforcement of the convention is stipulated in the first article: it is about every human beings under 18, unless the majority is attained earlier under the laws in effect in one country. Nevertheless, an infant and an older teenager being so different, several sections stipulate that they are applied on the basis of the age or maturity of the child. The articles of the convention establish different types of rights: Several articles focus on identity and family. These are the right to life, to a name and a nationality, the respect for the identity of the child. The right of non-separation between the child and parents is specified as follows: ""States Parties shall ensure that a child shall not be separated from his or her parents against their will, except when competent authorities subject to judicial review determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures, that such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child. Such determination may be necessary in a particular case such as one involving abuse or neglect of the child by the parent, or one where the parents are living separately and that a decision must be made as to the child place of residence."" Afterwards the article states the right of the child separated from one or both parents to maintain direct contact with them or see them regularly (article 9). Article 18 speaks of the obligation to raise the child. It says that the two parents are responsible of it, to assure his development. It is written that ""the best interests of the child will be their basic concern"" in it. Article 5 speaks of the rights and duties of the parents to guide and direct their child. This may be the role of the extended family or of the community depending on the customs and each situation. Article 14, regarding freedom of thought, conscience and religion, declares that children have these rights, and further adds that parents have the right and duty to guide the child in the exercise of these rights, in a manner consistent with hisher age and capacities. Articles 30 states that children of minorities who have their own religion, culture or language may not be deprived of it. Parents or the extended family have thus the right to transmit their identity, religion and culture to the child, while considering his liberty, in relation to his age. This makes that a state can not take children out of their families, communities or of the influence they have on this children, even if the representatives of this state declare that they aim to give them an education that they think is better. Actually, this occurred in several countries in the 20th Century. Children in family in the United Kingdom in Morocco, in Norway and a small girl against her house (a yurt) in Mongolia. These are the most known rights. They are the rights of children to be protected against violence and maltreatment, including those with parental involvement, and to be protected from abandonment or negligence. Countries have to watch over so they can intervene in cases of maltreatment. These are also the rights to health care, a decent life, to be protected from all forms of exploitation bad for the well-being of the child and in particular the sexual exploitation and abuse. On child labour, the Convention does not prohibit child labour at any age, but it states that children should be protected from economic exploitation and from work that is hazardous or that are bad for their development (Article 32). It requires also that countries have regulations concerning child labor (minimum age, limited hours...) The protection also applies to drugs, abduction and sale of children. It limits the involvement of children in wars. The article 37 and 40 establish several protections and guarantees in case of accusation of an offence or crime and in case of stay in prison. A child or teenager should not be arrested without valid reason. If heshe is suspected or convicted of an offence or a crime, he shall be informed quickly of what he is accused of, he shall be able to be helped to defend himself and be respected and protected, taking into account his age. His imprisonment should be the last solution. In prison heshe should be treated humanely and with dignity, he should be able to keep in touch with his family, to be helped, and that his case is handled fairly and without long delays if there must be a judgement. States must find laws and measures tailored to children suspected or convicted. When institutions make decisions that affect a child, ""the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration"" (article 3). Nepalese girls transporting bricks. Teenagers in prison in Pakistan Articles 28 and 29 focus on education and its objectives. Countries must reach a free and compulsory primary education for all, and that the secondary education, including general and vocational education (middle and high school levels) is open and accessible, as well as higher education (universities and equivalent), depending on the capacity of each. Children and teenagers should be properly informed on school and vocational counselling (educational and vocational information and guidance should be available and accessible to all children). About the teaching, it is written that States should be ""facilitating access to scientific and technical knowledge and modern teaching methods."" The objectives of education according to the convention are: A school in Bangladesh. New Zealand students performing a haka Schoolgirls in Thailand Group work in a primary school in Madagascar Article 17 says that countries must watch that the media (radio, television, newspapers, and now internet) is conveying suitable and useful information to children, especially cultural, which allows for an understanding of other cultures. They must protect children from information and material which may be injurious to their well-being, bearing in mind the freedom of expression and of information of the children. The 31st article gives the right of the child to rest and to leisure: ""States Parties recognize the right of the child to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and the arts."" Finally, a part of the convention is about the so-called participation rights, also called positive or political rights, that is to say, articles that give children, depending on their age, rights to express themselves and act as autonomous individuals. These rights are: These rights were not present in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child of 1959. They claim some citizen rights for children, thought not as wide as those of adult people. The States shall comply with the convention and make sure it is fulfilled. In some case, they have or they had to pass new laws or change certain laws to comply with this commitment. For example, article 371 of the French Civil code on parental authority (child custody) was modified by a law of 2002 which added: ""Parents shall make their child party to decisions concerning him, according to his age and degree of maturity."" This comes from Article 12 of the Convention which is: ""States Parties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her own views the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child."" When no law is taking up what the convention states, as a treaty, the convention should be above the law and may directly apply, this is nevertheless debated. Several articles stipulate rather what the States must take in charge. This is the case with the article 6: ""States Parties shall ensure to the maximum extend possible the survival and development of the child."" The implementation of the Right of the child is never finished and the situation of the child in the World shows that its objectives are quite far from being accomplished. Young girls of Panama The convention encourage the dissemination of children's books. A girl at work in Cambodia A baby breast-fed by his mother in Zanzibar The convention states that is enforcement must be followed and checked. The article 43 creates a group for that: the Committee on the Rights of the Child. It has 18 members, each elected for a four years term by the representatives of the countries. The costs of operating this committee are paid by the U.N., as well as the salaries of its members. The two following articles specify the functioning and role of this committee. They assemble three times a year in Geneva (January, May, and September) for three-week sessions each. The States Parties (who have signed and ratified the convention) must present to the Committee of the Right of the Child every five years a report on the implementation of the rights stated by the Convention. These reports are read and studied and the committee responds to them through ""final observations."" The Committee works with other UN organisations or NGOs, and it is also in charge to inform as well as possible on the Rights of the Child. However, this committee does not hold the power to bind a country to change when it does not respect certain rights of the convention, or to impose sanctions to this country. The Convention was criticised on several points: some said it was too idealistic and could not effectively change the children difficulties in the poor countries. They also say that giving citizenship rights (speech ...) would be giving a responsibility that could be dangerous to children: the best way to grow would rather be that the children are all under adult guardianship including to form their ideas before being adults themselves. Some regret that the convention contains only rights and not duties. On the other side, the Convention was supported and waved by many people. They consider in one hand that it allow a better protection for children, and in the other hand that it fosters a benevolent change in the way children may be dealt with, for example by the fact that one should be considering their opinion on matters affecting them.",Easy

"Bengali literature refers to the literary works produced in the Bengali language, primarily in the eastern regions of the Indian subcontinent, including Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. It boasts a rich heritage dating back to the 10th century and has played a pivotal role in shaping the cultural and intellectual landscape of the region. Bengali literature encompasses diverse genres, styles, and themes, reflecting the dynamic history and cultural evolution of the Bengali-speaking people. Early Period: The earliest known literary work in Bengali is the ""Charyapada,"" a collection of mystical poems dating back to the 10th century. It marked the beginning of Bengali literature, blending elements of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Tantric traditions. Medieval Period: The medieval period saw the emergence of narratives like the Mangalkavyas, devotional poetry dedicated to Hindu deities. The 15th-century poet Chandidas and the 16th-century poet Vidyapati made significant contributions to this genre. In the 19th century, known as the Bengal Renaissance, they witnessed a remarkable literary and cultural revival. Key figures like Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Michael Madhusudan Dutt played crucial roles in promoting social reforms and contributing to the literary scene. Michael Madhusudan Dutt: Often hailed as the pioneer of Bengali drama, Dutt's epic poem ""Meghnad Badh Kavya"" broke traditional norms and introduced blank verse in Bengali literature. Rabindranath Tagore, one of the most celebrated figures in Bengali literature, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913 for his collection of poems, ""Gitanjali."" Tagore's contributions extend beyond poetry to include plays, essays, and short stories, making him a towering figure in world literature. The post-independence era brought forth a new wave of Bengali literature, addressing contemporary issues and exploring diverse themes. Notable writers include Satyajit Ray, the filmmaker and author, and Sunil Gangopadhyay, known for his prolific output in various genres. Bengali Poetry: The tradition of poetry is deeply ingrained in Bengali literature, with diverse forms such as Chhanda, Ghazal, and Nazrulgeeti. Poets like Jibanananda Das and Kazi Nazrul Islam have left an indelible mark on Bengali poetry. Bengali Fiction: The Bengali novel has seen illustrious contributions from authors like Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Saratchandra Chattopadhyay, and Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay. Themes range from social realism to psychological explorations. Bengali Drama: The evolution of Bengali drama can be traced back to the works of Michael Madhusudan Dutt and Rabindranath Tagore. Modern playwrights like Badal Sircar and Manoj Mitra have added contemporary perspectives to the theatrical landscape. Bengali literature has profoundly influenced the broader spectrum of Indian literature. Writers like Saratchandra Chattopadhyay and Rabindranath Tagore have inspired authors in various Indian languages, contributing to a rich tapestry of literary traditions.",Easy
"Mahabharata OverviewHistory: The Mahabharata is to be known as the longest poem ever written. It has over 200,000 verse lines. This poem was written by the epic god Ganesha and was dictated by the great sage Veda Vyasa. It was written in between the eighth and the sixth century BCE. Storyline: The story begins when Pandu, who was on the throne of Hastinapura, got exiled to the forest with his two wives for many years because he killed a sage who was in the form of a deer. While the sage was dying from the arrow Pandu shot, he cursed him, thereby keeping Pandu from having children on his own. Therefore, during his exile, he asked the gods to father children for him. Consequently, Dharma Raja (king of death) gave birth to Yudhishtira, Vayu (god of wind) fathered Bhima, Lord Indra (king of the heavens) gave birth to Arjuna, and the Ashvin twins (the divine twin horsemen) fathered Sahadeva and Nakula (also twins). Thus, began the era of the Pandava brothers. Meanwhile, Dhritarashtra (Pandu's brother) had fathered the Kauravas, one hundred brothers. These one-hundred brothers wanted the throne of Hastinapura for themselves, but they knew they could not do so. When Yudhishtira turned sixteen years old, he led his father, his father's wives, and his four siblings back to Hatsinapura, to rule again. The Kauravas, who were jealous of the Pandavas' claim to the throne, tried to kill them in a variety of ways. Bishma, the head of the family, demanded that the Kauravas and the Pandavas rule the kingdom separately. Some time later, Yudhishtira was invited to a game of dice by Sakuni, who played for the Kauravas. The loser of the game of dice was to be exiled from the kingdom for thirteen years. Sakuni won the game, and the Pandavas were exiled for thirteen years in the forest. According to one condition, however, the Pandavas were exiled for twelve years instead of thirteen. When they returned, the Kauravas had taken the kingdom. The Pandava brothers wanted to, once again, have control over the kingdom, but the Kauravas didn't want to release their hold on the land. Thus began the Kurukshetra war. It was a long and horrible war, but the Pandava brothers ultimately won and ruled over the kingdom for thirty-six years. The crown was then transferred to their grandson Parikshit because they wanted to return to the forest with their wife Draupadi, and they lived there for the rest of their humble lives.

"Azerbaijan is a medium-sized country in the South Caucasus region of Europe. Until 1991, Azerbaijan was a part of the Soviet Union (USSR). The capital city is Baku and the country shares borders with Russia, Georgia, Armenia, Iran and Turkey. Azerbaijan is not part of the European Union and uses the Manat as its currency. The area of present-day Azerbaijan was settled beginning in about the 8th century BC by the Medes, an ancient Aryan tribe. It became part of the Persian Empire in the 6th century BC. Between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, the Romans conquered the area of present-day Azerbaijan. Christianity began to spread there in the 3rd century. In 1920 the Azerbaijani were taken over by the Soviet Union or the USSR. In 1991 Azerbaijan became independent from the Soviet Union. After becoming independent, Azerbaijan and Armenia fought as war called the Nagorno-Karabakh War which killed more than 30,000 people on both sides. Since the 1990s Azerbaijan has become more prosperous, mostly because of large amounts of oil. Azerbaijan covers an area of about 86,600 km2. Azerbaijan borders the Caspian Sea to the east, Georgia and Russia to the north, Iran to the south, and Armenia to the south-west and west. The capital of Azerbaijan is the ancient city of Baku, which has the largest and best harbour on the Caspian Sea. Azerbaijan is located in both Europe and Asia. The highest mountain in the country is Bazardüzü which is 4466 metres above sea level. Another interesting feature of Azerbaijan are the mud volcanoes - half of all mud volcanoes in the world are situated in Azerbaijan. The population of Azerbaijan is just under 10 million. Azerbaijani, Russian, Lezgin, and Talysh are the languages that are spoken by the people who live in the country. The national language is Azerbaijani or Azeri and almost 93 percent of the population speak it. People from Azerbaijan are called Azerbaijani or Azeris; Dagestanis and Russians are the largest minority groups in Azerbaijan, followed by Armenians. The majority of people in the country are considered Muslim but there are also small numbers of Orthodox Christians. Some adults in Azerbaijan can read and write. Education is required for the first eight years, but some children continue their education. Azerbaijan has two UNESCO World Heritage Sites: The Walled City of Baku (and Shirvanshahs' Palace and the Maiden Tower) all in the capital, Baku and Rock Art in the Gobustan National Park - a site full of ancient art from 4,000 to 40,000 years ago. Tourism was extremely popular during the 1980s but because of wars in the 1990s tourists went elsewhere. Tourism has only recently become important again in Azerbaijan. Religious, spa and health care tourism is becoming more and more popular every year. Castles, national parks, two Heritage Sites, skiing in the winter and swimming in the summer are activities that tourists can do while visiting Azerbaijan.

"Kazakhstan is a very large country in far eastern Europe and western Asia. It shares borders with Russia, Uzbekistan, China, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan. The capital city is Astana. Other big cities are Almaty (the previous capital city) and Karaganda. Kazakhstan is not part of the European Union and uses the Tenge as its currency. Main article: History of Kazakhstan The Russians began advancing into the Kazakh steppe in the 18th century, and by the mid-19th century all of Kazakhstan was part of the Russian Empire. Following the 1917 Russian Revolution, and civil war, the territory of Kazakhstan was reorganized several times before becoming the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic in 1936, a part of the USSR (Soviet Union). Kazakhstan declared itself an independent country on December 16, 1991, the last Soviet republic to do so. Kazakhstan is ranked as the ninth largest country in the world as well as the world's largest landlocked country. It has an area of 2.7 million square kilometres (1.05 million sq. mi). It is bordered by Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and China. The country also borders on a large part of the Caspian Sea. The climate is continental, with warm summers and colder winters. Kazakhstan has thousands of lakes and rivers and most of the country is not populated. Most of the country is part of the continent of Asia and only a small part in the north-west is located in Europe. The highest mountain in Kazakhstan is the massive Khan Tengri which is 6,995 metres (7,010 metres including its ice cap). It is one of the few mountains in the world of this height. The Kazakh language, spoken by 65 percent of the population, has the status of the ""state"" language, while Russian, which is spoken by almost all Kazakhstanis, is declared the ""official"" language, and is used routinely in business. The ethnic Kazakhs represent 59 percent of the population and ethnic Russians 25 percent. Other ethnic groups represented, include Tatars, Uzbeks, Bashkirs, Uyghurs and Ukrainians. Islam is the largest religion in Kazakhstan, followed by Russian Orthodox Christianity. Kazakhstan has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasavi, Petroglyphs and Saryarqa (Steppe and Lakes of Northern Kazakhstan).

"A conspiracy is when people make a secret plan or agreement to do something that breaks the law or hurts other people. There are many true conspiracies. A conspiracy theory is when an event is described as a conspiracy without evidence or when the evidence suggest it is not a conspiracy. People who believe conspiracy theories usually believe that most or all conspiracies are part of the same conspiracy. Events are blamed on a secret unified group of people. Those people are so powerful that they are controlling the outcome of all events. People who believe in conspiracy theories also believe that anything that disproves their beliefs is part of the conspiracy and can't be trusted. In this way, it is impossible to prove or disprove anything. Studies indicate that belief in conspiracy theories hurt the people that believe them. And people who believe them often have other problems such as paranoia (believing other people are out to get them), psychological projection (blaming others for things they are guilty of), are manipulative (try to secretly change other people's behavior or thoughts), unemotional, and don't care about right and wrong. John F. Kennedy was the 35th president of theUnited States from 1961 to his death in 1963. President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald on 22November1963, inDallas,Texas. He was being driven through the city in an open top car with the Governor of Texas when two shots were fired at Kennedy: one hit his upper back, the second hit his head. Oswald was murdered two days after the assassination. PresidentLyndon B. Johnsoncreated theWarren Commissionto investigate the assassination. The commission said that Oswald acted alone and that he was emotionally unstable and that he hated America. Most people today do not believe that Oswald acted alone. Some of the people who are believed to have been involved include President Lyndon B. Johnson, the KGB (communist spies), Fidel Castro (leader of communist Cuba), the CIA (US spies), and the Mafia. The Apollo program was a United States space program carried out by NASA and succeeded in landing humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. In 1976, Bill Kaysing, a former US Navy officer who worked at a company that built rocket engines, started the conspiracy theory with a self-published book claiming the Moon landings were faked. In 1978, the film Capricorn One showed NASA faking a trip to Mars and probably made the Moon conspiracy popular. In 1980, the Flat Earth Society claimed NASA, Walt Disney, Arthur C. Clarke (a science fiction author), and Stanley Kubrick (a famed film director) filmed the Moon landing in Hollywood. The September 11 attacks were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda against the United States on the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001. The attack killed 2,977 people (343firefighters, and 71law enforcement officers), injured 25,000 people, and health problems caused by the attack killed more people months and years after the attack. Four passenger airliners were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists. Two of the planes were flown into the World Trade Center towers in New York. All 7 World Trade Center buildings, two 110-story towers, a 47-story tower and 5 others were destroyed. A third plane was crashed into the Pentagon. The fourth plane was flying towards Washington, D.C., but the passengers overpowered the hijackers when they found out what had happened to the other planes. The plane crashed in a field. Some people claim that the World Trade Center buildings were deliberately blown up from the inside. Some others claim that the Pentagon was hit by a missile launched by the U.S. government or that a commercial airliner was allowed to crash into the Pentagon. They say the attacks were either allowed or faked to justify an invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. The Illuminati was a real conspiracy that started in 1776 but it was gone by 1787. In 1797 several people wrote books saying the Illuminati still existed and was behind the French Revolution. It took on conspiracy theory status when it was linked to other groups such as the Round Table Movement, the Bilderbergers, and the Council on Foreign Relations. Modern belief that the Earth is flat started in 1849 by Samuel Rowbotham. The Universal Zetetic Societykept the idea around after Rowbotham died. In 1956 Samuel Shenton created the International Flat Earth Research Society.By 1997 the organization declined. But in 2004 the Flat Earth Society returned via the Internet. Members of the society say that NASA and the governments are deluding the public. In 1938, the night before Halloween, Orson Welles broadcast over the radio news of an alien invasion. It was the fictional story, The War of the Worlds, but many listeners did not know that and there was a lot of confusion and outrage. In mid-1947, a device crashed at a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. The US military said it was a weather balloon. In the 1970's ufologists claimed that it was an alien spacecraft. In the 1990s, the US military said it was a nuclear test surveillance balloon from Project Mogul, an attempt at detecting Soviet Union nuclear bomb tests. In May 1989, Bob Lazar appeared on a television show and said he worked near Area 51 studying a flying saucer and that he read documents that said grey aliens have been visiting the Earth for the past 10,000 years. His story made Area 51 a popular conspiracy theory topic. Several studies have shown the biggest reason why people believe conspiracy theories is because they do not feel like they have control over their lives. Disagreeing with others makes them feel like they don't have to listen to authority figures. Adopting contrary beliefs make people feel smarter than everyone else. And when other people give evidence that contradicts their beliefs, they hold to their beliefs and call it faith. This can make them feel like they are doing the right thing and even morally superior.Roger Cohen described conspiracy theories as ""the ultimate refuge of the powerless"". Al-Mumin Said said they ""keep us not only from the truth but also from confronting our faults and problems"". Many real events also created an environment that fostered conspiracy theories. The following are real events. During World War II the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom were allies against Nazi Germany. When the war ended, the United States and the United Kingdom began to have disagreements with the Soviet Union. Tension built and eventually each side supported opposite sides in smaller wars of other countries. So the Soviet Union and United States never went to war directly, but each were doing there best to defeat the efforts of the other country. The secrecy, lies, illegal behavior and atmosphere of fear generated by the Cold War contribute to people's willingness to believe conspiracy theories. According to Richard Thieme, the CIA was pumping out so much propaganda and cover stories that even in the CIA, nobody knew what was real or lies. American-born couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who belonged to the Young Communist League in New York City, were accused and convicted of givingthe Soviet Union top-secret information aboutradar,sonar,jet propulsionengines, and valuablenuclear weapon designs which could lead to the Soviet Union developing nuclear weapons years before anyone thought possible. They were executed for treason in 1953. This began a nuclear arms race between the Soviet Union and the United States. Following this hundredsof Americans were accused of being communist spies, mainly government employees, entertainers, academicians, and labor-union activists. There were spies in the government, but not as many as were being accused. This was called the Second Red Scare and McCarthyism. Between 1945 and 1959 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians were taken from post-WWII Germany to America for U.S. government employment. Many were former members, and some were former leaders, of theNazi Party. This was all done in secret and was done to make sure the Soviet Union did not recruit them for their purposes. The U.S. called this Operation Paperclip. One of the scientists, Wernher von Braun, went to work at NASA and developed the Saturn V rocket, which was the rocket that took people to the Moon. He was a Nazi SS officer during World War II. Because it was so difficult to know what was happening in the Soviet Union, the CIA began a top-secret spy airplane program in 1954which led to the U-2 in 1955 and the A-12 Oxcart in 1963(which became the SR-71 Blackbird). They were tested and flew out of Area 51. Both of these programs created many UFO sightings and the CIA told many lies to hide the existence of these planes (the A-12 Oxcart wasn't declassified until 2008). On 1 May 1960, the Soviet Union shot down and capture the pilot alive. The U.S. did not believe any U-2 pilot could survive being shot down. The U.S. said the plane was not a spy plane and was off course and that the U.S. President Eisenhower didn't know anything about it. On May 7, Nikita Khrushchev, the leader of the Soviet Union, revealed the pilot was alive, which forced President Eisenhower to either admit he lied or continue to lie and look like the CIA did whatever it wanted and he wasn't in charge. On May 11, President Eisenhower gave a speech and revealed the spy program and confessed to knowing about the mission. In 1953, the CIA started Project MKUltra. It was a mind control program. Many Americans were illegally given mind altering drugs, sometimes without their knowledge. The CIA wanted to produce a truth drug for interrogating suspected Soviet spies and to see if they could control people's minds. Most of the MKUltra records were destroyed in 1973. Fidel Castro was the communist President of Cuba from 1965to 2011. The CIA attempted to assassinate him hundreds of times. This was all top secret because it was against the United Nations Charter. The last documented attempt was in 2000. The Mafia was even hired in 1960. Fidel Castro died in 2016. Secret societies hide various details of their society or even its very existence. Some are very open about their existence but hide what they do like Freemasons and the Skull and Bones. Some participate in criminal activities and hide everything they can like theKu Klux Klan, and theMafia. ManyChristian churchesforbid their members from joining secret societies.",Easy

"The Snail is an animal, that's the most slowest animal in the world. Snails that breathe using their lungs belong to the Pulmonata group, which is traditionally formulated. Based on the findings of a molecular study conducted by Jorger et al. In 2010, it was determined that it was a polyphyletic group. In other words, snails with lungs and snails with gills form a series of taxonomic groups that are not necessarily closely related to each other, but are related to some other groups. Snails that have lungs and those that have gills have branched out so much over a geological period of time that several species with gills can be found on land, and numerous species with lungs can be found in freshwater. Even a few marine species have lungs. Snails can be found in a very wide range of environments, including ditches, deserts and great depths of the sea. Although terrestrial snails are better known to laymen, marine snails make up most species of snails and have much greater diversity and greater biomass. Numerous species of snails can also be found in fresh water. Most snails have thousands of microscopic tooth-like structures found on a banded tongue called radula . Radula functions like a file, tearing food into small pieces. Many snails are herbivores , eating plants or rough algae from the surface with their radulas. Several terrestrial species and many marine species are omnivores or predatory carnivores. Snails cannot absorb colored pigments when they eat paper or cardboard, so their feces are also colored. Several species of the genus Achatina and related genera are known as giant African terrestrial snails; some grow up to 15 in (38 cm) from the muzzle to the end of the tail, and weigh 1 kg (2 lb).The largest extant sea snail species is Syrinx aruanus; its shell can be up to 90 cm (35 in) long, and whole shell animals can weigh up to 18 kg (40 lb). The Lymnae snail makes decisions using only two types of neurons: one decides if the snail is hungry and the other if there is food nearby.

"Cleopatra VII Philopator (69 BC – 12 August 30 BC) was the last active pharaoh of Ancient Egypt. Her son Caesarion survived her for a short time as pharaoh before being assassinated on Augustus's orders. Cleopatra managed to align herself with some of the most powerful men of the ancient world. Cleopatra was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, a family of Greek origin that ruled Egypt after Alexander the Great's death during the Hellenistic period. The family refused to speak Egyptian and only spoke Greek. Cleopatra however did learn to speak Egyptian, and represented herself as the reincarnation of the Egyptian goddess, Isis. As pharaoh, she formed a liaison with Julius Caesar, the most powerful man in the world at that time. This liaison solidified her grip on the Egyptian throne. She bore Caesar a son, Ceasarion. When Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, she aligned herself with his protege, Marc Antony, angering Caesar's legal heir Augustus. Cleopatra and Antony opposed Augustus in a bid to rule the Roman world. They were defeated by Octavian's forces at the Battle of Actium in 30 BC. Antony committed suicide. Cleopatra used an asp as the means of her death on August 12, 30 BC. Cleopatra has always fascinated the western world. Her death has been the subject of numerous modern paintings.

"Montsoreau is a historic town in the Loire Valley in western France. It is part of the department of Maine-et-Loire, Pays de la Loire region, and situated 250 kilometers from Paris. Montsoreau is famous for its Château. The town is part of the French association of The Most Beautiful Villages of France. In 2000, the Loire Valley between Sully-sur-Loire and Chalonnes, in particular Montsoreau and the Château de Montsoreau, was inscribed on the list of World Heritage sites by UNESCO. The name of Montsoreau comes from the rock on which is currently built the castle of Montsoreau, Mont Soreau (in Latin Mons Sorello, monte Sorello or Monte Sorelli). No explanation was given on the interpretation of the name Sorello. Montsoreau is a very old place, which still holds Neolithic and Gallo-Roman remains. The first texts mention a fishing village in the year 600 under the name Restis (Filet). According to archaeological excavations, it seems that at that time a temple or an administrative building occupied the rock of Montsoreau. It is the Count of Blois, who first (996) build a fortress on Mount Soreau. This fortress was very quickly conquered by the Count of Anjou, who subsequently modified it and made it impregnable. It was taken only once in its history, by the King of England Henry II, in 1152. In 1450, John II de Chambes (the first adviser to King Charles VII) bought the fortress from his brother-in-law, destroyed it and built the castle still in place. The site where the city is built is in the immediate vicinity of the confluence of the Vienne and the Loire rivers. The city is crossed by the Loire and has an island on its right bank, the island of Than. Montsoreau is a small town of 447 inhabitants and it is part of the agglomeration of Saumur-Val de Loire which has a little more than 100,000 inhabitants.

"Martyred Intellectuals Day, observed on December 14th, is a solemn occasion commemorating the intellectuals who were brutally murdered during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. This day holds significant historical and cultural importance for the people of Bangladesh, serving as a reminder of the sacrifices made by those who sought intellectual freedom and the right to self-determination. The roots of Martyred Intellectuals Day trace back to the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, a conflict that emerged from the struggle for independence from Pakistan. As the war intensified, the Pakistani military junta targeted intellectuals, including academics, writers, journalists, and professionals, in an attempt to cripple the intellectual backbone of the Bengali nation. The atrocities committed during this dark period resulted in the systematic killing of countless intellectuals who were perceived as symbols of the Bengali nationalist movement. Many were abducted, tortured, and subsequently executed on the eve of the victory of the allied forces. Martyred Intellectuals Day is observed annually on December 14th to pay homage to those intellectuals who lost their lives during the Liberation War. The day begins with various ceremonies, including memorial services, cultural events, and discussions about the significance of intellectual freedom and the sacrifices made for the nation's independence. Throughout Bangladesh, educational institutions, cultural organizations, and government offices organize events to honor the memory of the martyred intellectuals. The national flag is flown at half-mast, and a somber atmosphere prevails as the nation collectively reflects on the impact of the loss of these distinguished individuals. The martyred intellectuals are remembered not only for their tragic end but also for their contributions to literature, academia, and various fields. Their legacy lives on through the continued pursuit of knowledge, intellectual freedom, and the spirit of resilience displayed by the people of Bangladesh. The sacrifice of the martyred intellectuals played a pivotal role in shaping the national identity of Bangladesh and fostering a collective commitment to upholding the principles of democracy, justice, and human rights. Their contributions are acknowledged as a source of inspiration for future generations.",Easy

Risotto is an Italian dish which consists of rice cooked in stock or broth, together with other ingredients such as meat and vegetables. Usually, people would eat either antipasto or pasta, then the risotto. It is easy and quick to cook. Risotto originates from Italy.The Arabs introduced rice to Italy during the Middle Ages. Shorter-grained rice could be grown well due to the humidity of the Mediterranean climate. Rice became well known throughout Italy. Other countries discovered the quality of the Italian product. Availability of the grain spread, making this rice more widely accessible. A state in Italy called Milan started applying a technique called ‘slow-cooking’ to the short-grained rice. The slow-cooking technique developed the rice’s rich flavors and spices (particularly saffron) for which the area was known, to create ‘Risotto alla Milanese’. Risotto became increasingly popular starting in the northern region, then the central, and southern region. Apart from pasta, risotto is very popular in Italy. The usual ingredients to make risotto are short-grained Italian rice, which is the only kind of rice to make risotto. Arborio rice is recommended. Butter is needed for frying the rice. The soffritto of other ingredients such as onions and shallots would give out the unique flavor and its aroma of the risotto. Meat or seafood would add more flavour to it, for example sausages, sliced beef, prawns, clams, etc. Adding wine is always recommended for enriching the flavors. The type of oil mostly used is olive oil for the risotto’s texture. Chicken broth or stock is required when toasting. Salt and pepper would add to the flavor. Saffron is mainly for the coloring. Before starting, it is better not to wash the rice as its starch helps the risotto keep its traditional look. The rice is placed in the frying pan, together with butter, then toast it lightly. Starts cooking with the broth and later add saffron. Then add the meats and herbs, and mix the rice and vegetables together. While doing so, olive oil could be added when toasting adding to its quality. It is better served when the ready. risotto has a thick and creamy texture. Gualtiero Marchesi is the creator of the newly founded Italian cuisine in Milan. He instructed that the cook has to toast the rice with a little butter. Next, start cooking it with broth and mix it all up with the addition of saffron. While the dish is blending, melt the onion separately in a little butter and white wine. Adding very cold fresh butter will result in having a smooth cream for the Risotto. Stir the risotto with this butter when cooked. One of Italy's most famous dishes is Risotto alla Milanese. In Po Valley, where the bulk of Italian rice grows, Risotto usually is preferred as the first course over pasta. In Venice and Veneto, risotto with sautéed eels is served as a traditional Christmas meal. There were only a few types of risottos in the past. Italians love the taste of the traditional Risotto. Methods of cooking risotto developed through time as new varieties of risottos start to emerge, such as Saffron Risotto with Butternut Squash and Seafood Risotto. Today, many chefs and cooks have created new and delicious risottos because of new ingredients importing in the country. There are many innovations that would change the risotto’s tastes, looks and texture, such as adding extra ingredients like wine or food coloring. In the past, wine wasn’t added to the traditional risotto, while today it is used for flavor, acidity and to add liquid to the risotto, which could also be substituted with others.",Easy

All mammals share a unique feature: female mammals, when having a baby, produce milk to feed him. Milk is produced in the mammary gland, which means that all mammals have mammary glands. Most of (but not all) mammals give birth to living young, but some of them, like the strange platypus, lay eggs. Mammals have fur and a very precise kind of temperature regulation. The females bear live young, and produce milk for the young. Parental care of the young is universal among mammals, and it is essential because live birth limits the number of offspring.",Easy

It creates a burrow only inches below the surface of the Earth. This burrow has several chambers for sleeping and storing foods. It has several exits and sometimes lengthy tunnels connecting the various chambers. The chipmunk hides the entrance and exits with dry leaves, twigs, and mosses. It eats seeds, berries, and other wild fruits as well as some insects and garden bulbs like tulips and daffodils. The chipmunk searches his woodland surroundings for food and carries it back to its burrow in his cheek pouches. The Eastern chipmunk remains in its burrow through the winter when food is scarce. The animsl eats from his stores and sleeps for long periods. In the spring, he emerges and looks for a mate. His enemies are owls, hawks, foxes, house cats, and other forest predators. In the wild, he may live three years. In captivity, he may live as long as eight years.

"""The Star-Spangled Banner"" is the national anthem of the United States of America. The words were written in 1814 by Francis Scott Key after the bombardment of Fort McHenry by the British. The words were paired with a well known tune by John Stafford Smith first published in 1778. ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" became the official national anthem of the United States on March 3, 1931 by a congressional resolution which was signed by President Herbert Hoover. The anthem is sung or played at State functions, and has become a ritual at American sports events. The words to ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" were written in 1814 by Francis Scott Key after he watched the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships in Chesapeake Bay during the War of 1812. His poem was titled ""In Defense of Fort M'Henry"". The poem has four stanzas, but in modern America only the first stanza is usually sung. The poem was partnered with a tune composed by John Stafford Smith for a men's social club in London. This tune was called ""To Anacreon in Heaven"". It was already known and popular in the United States. This tune is difficult to sing because it ranges over an octave and a half.

"Tyrannosaurus rex, or T. rex for short, was a dinosaur that lived on Earth about 65 to 70 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period. T. rex is one of the largest carnivorous (meat-eating) dinosaurs ever discovered. It is also quite likely the best-known dinosaur of all. Tyrannosaurus rex was up to 13 meters long and 5 meters tall, and weighed 4 to 6 tons – longer than a bus, and heavier than an elephant. It had a forward tilt, deep jaws, huge teeth, a long tail, and tiny arms (also known as forelimbs). T. rex's jaw alone was about 1.3 meters long and had fifty to sixty bone-crunching teeth that were up to 10 centimeters or 6 inches long. Its arms were very stubby, no longer than a human being's. They were very strong, able to lift up to two hundred kilograms, but were not long enough to touch each other! T. rex stood on two powerful hind legs, each ending with a three-toed foot, resembling a bird's foot, only much larger. Stil we don't know: T. rex was a very big meat-eating dinosaur, also called a carnivore. It would have been at the top of the food chain. It is known to have fed on other large dinosaurs, such as Edmontosaurus, Anatosaurus, and Triceratops, and probably could have swallowed smaller dinosaurs in a single bite. One scientist believes that T. rex was a scavenger (an animal that eats already dead animals). He argues that it might not have been fast enough to catch prey. Other scientists believe that T. rex probably scavenged and hunted, like most living meat-eaters (such as tigers and lions). T. rex bite marks found on the bones of Edmontosaurus and Triceratops that have healed show that Tyrannosaurus did hunt at least some of the time – and also that its prey was sometimes lucky enough to escape. One thing that T. rex did not eat was people. People didn't appear on Earth until over 60 million years later, much too late for anyone ever to be afraid of being hunted down by a T. rex. We don't know whether T. rex was just a scavenger or a scavenger and a hunter. There are very few hunting animals that will not scavenge, and very few scavengers which never hunt. Tyrannosaurus lived about 65 to 70 million years ago, in the late Cretaceous Period. T. rex was among the last of the big dinosaurs. Like all non-bird dinosaurs, T. rex lived in the Mesozoic era. Tyrannosaurus is believed to have lived in forests, near rivers, and in areas that were open and full of prey. Mild seasons would have been most favourable to it. Tyrannosaurus fossils have been found in western North America and possibly Asia. The famous fossil hunter Barnum Brown found the first Tyrannosaurus fossil in 1905. Tyrannosaurus was not the dinosaur's name until 1905, when it was given that name by Henry Fairfield Osborn. About 3,000 Tyrannosaurus fossils have been found, from pieces of teeth to nearly complete skeletons. Only one possible Tyrannosaurus footprint has been found.",Easy

"Capitalism is an economic system where the means of production (factories, for example) are owned by corporations or individuals, not by a government or communities, and where people have to barter or work for money, so they can buy things they need or want, such as food. Capitalism mostly has a ""free market"" economy, which means people buy and sell things by their own judgment. In most countries in the world today the economy also has a degree of regulation, done by the government or by trade unions, so some argue that they should be called ""mixed economies"" instead of completely free markets. Some people disagree on whether capitalism is a good idea, or how much of capitalism is a good idea. The word comes from ""capital"", meaning something of value. This can be money (""financial capital"") or any other goods that can be traded. ""Capital"" originally comes from the Latin word caput, meaning ""head"", because it was used to mean how many ""head"" of cattle a wealthy person owned, in days long ago when cattle were used as money. (In fact, the words ""capital"" and ""cattle"" both come from caput.) In capitalism, people may sell or lend their property, and other people may buy or borrow them. If one person wants to buy, and another person wants to sell to them, they do not need to get permission from higher power. People can have a market (buying and selling with each other) without anyone else telling them to. What can be described as capitalism and the free market economy was introduced in by the philosopher Adam Smith in his book The Wealth of Nations, although the word capitalist and capitalism was not introduced till the late 19th century. The word capital can be used to produce more things or money. For example, lands, factories, shops, tools and machines are capital. If someone has money that can be invested, that is a capital too. People who own capital are sometimes called capitalists (people who support capitalism are called capitalists, too). They can hire anyone who wants to work in their factories, shops or lands for them for the pay they offer. In capitalist systems, many people are workers (or proletarians). They are employed in order to get money for living. People can choose to work for anyone who will hire them in a free market. This is different from many older economic systems. In feudalism, most people were serfs and had to work for the people who owned the land they lived on. In mercantilism, the government makes it hard to buy things from other countries. In many countries with mixed economies (part capitalism and part socialism) there are laws about what you can buy or sell, or what prices you can charge, or whom you can hire or fire. An investment is when people invest (give) their money in things. People can put their money together to buy or build things, even if they are too big for one person to make alone. The people who invest get to be the owners of what they buy or build together. The stock market lets people buy and sell investments. Investing is important to capitalism. The word ""capitalist"" can mean two things: it can mean someone who likes capitalism; but it can also mean someone who invests. For example,a venture capitalist invests in new businesses. People who start businesses, or invest in businesses, can make a lot of money. A business sells things that people want. The investors make extra money, which is called profit. Investors can take their profit and invest it in more businesses, or in making the business bigger. The investors can get more and more profit if the businesses are successful. Socialists, anarchists, communists and what are referred to as ""quasi-socialists"" are people who do not support capitalism. They say it hurts workers, because businesses make more money by selling things than they pay to the workers who make the things and, therefore, businessmen become rich while workers remain poor andor exploited. They also argue society would be more efficient if the individual was considerate of not only hisher interests, but the overall well being of society rather than competing against one another. Another argument is that each person has a right to minimal needs and within capitalism, sometimes people are not considerate of others or the environment in their quest for capital. The main difference between communists and spiritual communists is spiritual solidarity, as opposed to a materialist centered solidarity that most communists seek. Karl Marx was a famous communist philosopher from Germany. He wrote a famous book called The Capital (or Das Kapital in the German). He said that capitalism would go away after workers decided to take over the government in a revolution. There were violent communist revolutions, some of which caused civil wars, in many countries, and many people were killed because of this. But capitalism did not go away, and most of these Communist systems have collapsed and do not exist today, or else they have become more capitalist. Some people think that communism in those countries did not work because Marx's ideas, though nice in thought, did not really work. Others think that communist countries collapsed because of the attacks (military, political and economic) from capitalist countries. Anarchists (that are not anarcho-capitalists) do not support capitalism either. They do not think workers should take the government, but that there should be no government at all. They think that communism failed because the communists set up dictatorships that said that they would rule in the name of workers, instead of letting workers organize themselves freely. There are different words for people who support capitalism. In many parts of the world, these people are called either conservatives or liberals (especially market liberals). But in the United States, the word ""liberal"" can mean someone whose beliefs lean toward social democracy; more or less what in other countries might be called social liberal. Libertarian is a word that in America and some other countries means someone who opposes the state, much like an anarchist, but is strongly in favor of capitalism. People who support capitalism also have disagreements. Most people agree that capitalism works better if the government keeps people from stealing other people's things. If people could steal anything, then nobody would want to buy anything. In most countries, the government does more than that. It tries to make sure that people buy and sell fairly and that employment is fair. Because the government takes a lot of money in taxes, it also buys a lot of things and gives a lot of money away. It spends money on guns and ships for the military, on science research in universities, and on schools and libraries. It also gives money to people who do not have jobs, and to businesses that the political leaders think are important. Sometimes government gives money to people just because those people support the politicians who are in office. When the government is in charge of part of the economy, this is called a ""mixed economy."" A few people think that people can protect themselves without any government. Instead of having laws against stealing, people could protect their own things, or agree to pay other people such as arbitrators, insurers, and private defenders to protect them. This belief is called ""anarcho-capitalism."" These people think that the government is a thief, because it takes taxes away from people against their will and keeps them from making agreements between themselves.",Easy

"The Atlantic sturgeon (scientific name: Acipenser oxyrinchus) is a large fish. It dates to the Late Cretaceous period, making it about 85 million years old. It is one of the oldest fish on Earth. The fish has five bony plates called scutes along its body; a tail resembling a shark's tail; a long, sensitive snout; and four barbels covered with taste buds. Its colors range from bluish-black and olive green on its back to white on its underside. Atlantic sturgeon may live 30-60 years. The largest known specimen was a female which measured 4.27 meters (14 feet) in length. The fish can weigh over 360 kg (800 lbs). Its range extends from New Brunswick, Canada to the eastern coast of Florida, United States. The Atlantic sturgeon was once plentiful.

"Female (♀) is a biological sexual status in many multicellular organisms. It is the organism, or part of an organism, that produces non-mobile gametes, the ova. In addition, female organisms almost always carry the zygotes. In mammals, including humans, female organisms differ further from males due to the presence of organs necessary to mature the zygote and feed after birth. Consider a uterus and milking glands. In insects and fish, the female organisms are usually larger than the male. In humans and many other animals, the fact is whether an organism is genetically determined. In reptiles, however, the temperature of the eggs is also affected. Some animals, such as snails, may change in sex.",Easy

"Cassowaries (Casuarius) are a genus of large birds which cannot fly. They are part of a group of flightless birds called the ratites. The ostrich, emu, moa (now extinct) and small kiwi are other ratites. The cassowary lives in the tropical rainforests of New Guinea and north eastern Australia. They are shy birds living deep in the forest. They can also become angry, and they will attack people. This makes it hard to learn about them. Casuarius casuariusSouthern Cassowary Casuarius unappendiculatusNorthern Cassowary Casuarius bennettiDwarf Cassowary There are three living species of cassowary: The Southern Cassowary is the largest forest bird in the world, and the second heaviest bird in the world after the ostrich. It is third tallest after the ostrich and emu. Females are bigger and more brightly coloured. Adult Southern Cassowaries are between 1.5 m to 1.8 m tall. Some females may get as big as 2 m, and weigh about 70kg. They do not have feathers on their necks. The necks are brightly colored in red, blue, purple and yellow. The Southern Cassowary has two wattles, loose skin, which hangs down from their neck. The Northern Cassowary has one wattle. The Dwarf Cassowary has no wattles. Cassowaries have three toes on each foot. Each has a sharp claw. The middle toe has a claw like a dagger, which is 120mm long. Because a cassowary can kick, this claw is very dangerous and can hurt or kill enemies. Scientists believe they can run up to 50kmh. They can jump up to 1.5 m and they can swim. There have been reported attacks on people and animals by cassowaries. In April 1926, a cassowary killed a 16-year-old boy near Mossman, Queensland. The cassowary's wings are small, and are not flight feathers. They are not adapted for flying. Females lay between three and eight large, pale green-blue eggs at a time. These large eggs are about 90mm by 140mm and weigh about 600 grams. Ostrich and emu eggs are bigger. The male sits on the eggs for two months until they hatch. He then looks after the brown-striped chicks for nine months. The female mates with two or three males each year. A cassowary at the Healesville Sanctuary lived for 61 years. All three types of cassowary have a horn-like helmet called a casque on the top of their head. The casque is a keratinous skin (like a finger nail) over an inside made of firm, but foam like material. This material can be bent and squeezed but it goes back to its proper shape. The name cassowary comes from two Papuan words meaning ""horned head"". The reason for the casque is unknown. There are a number of different ideas, such as: Biologist Andrew Mack has watched cassowaries and disagreed with many of these ideas. He thinks that the casques play a part in the way cassowaries hear sounds or the way that they make sounds. He discovered that the Dwarf Cassowary and Southern Cassowary make a very low sound. It is the lowest known bird call, like a ""boom"", which people can only just hear. The Southern Cassowary sound was measured at 32 hertz, and the Dwarf Cassowary was even lower at only 23 hertz. The birds live by themselves, they do not live in groups so the ""booming sound"" might be a way for the birds to communicate (talk) over a long distance in thick rainforest. Scientists think that this way of talking may be how dinosaurs communicated with each other. Their main food is fruit, but they eat other things such as snails, fungi, ferns and flowers. They are important because they spread plant and fruit seeds through the forest. Each cassowary is known to live in an area of up to 700 ha, so they carry seeds a long way. At least 70 rainforest trees need the cassowary to spread their seeds. Their seeds are too big for other rainforest animals to carry. Seeds from 21 plants have to be eaten and pass through the cassowary or they will not grow. Some seeds are poisonous to all other animals; only the cassowary can eat them. Scientists have worked out that about 150 rainforest plants need the cassowary. The Southern Cassowary is now listed as endangered in Australia. Scientists think there are only between 1200 and 1500 cassowaries left in Australia. Many of the forest places that they like to live in have been cleared for farming and other development. It has been worked out that 75% of rain forest, where cassowaries used to live, have been cleared in Australia. When Cyclone Larry hit the Mission Beach area in 2006 a lot of cassowary forest was flattened. It is thought that 18% of the birds were killed by the storm. Animals such as wild pigs, dogs and cats, have become a big threat to the birds. Motor cars are a big danger to the birds. Scientists say that 70% of known cassowary deaths at Mission Beach, Queensland, were birds killed trying to cross roads. The Northern Cassowary in New Guinea is listed as vulnerable. They could easily become an endangered animal unless things are done to protect them. Scientists do not know how many birds there are, but they think there may be anywhere from 2,500 to 9,999 Northern Cassowaries left. The CSIRO are studying cassowary faeces to see if they can use their DNA to count how many birds are left. In 2008, the Australian Government stopped rainforest land being used to build houses at Mission Beach. They are going to try and keep corridors (narrow forest areas) so the birds can move between rainforest areas safely. People will be asked to replant forest trees and plants on their land to help make these corridors. The government is looking at buying land for more corridors. Scientists are finding out when and where cassowaries cross roads. This will mean strict limits on motor car speeds to protect cassowaries that might try to cross some roads. Plans are being looked at to build raised roads so the birds can pass underneath. Many zoos, such as the Australian Reptile Park in Gosford, the Airlie Beach Wildlife Park and the Denver Zoo are trying to breed cassowaries. Cassowaries in zoos have lived for up to 60 years. The first cassowary kept in a zoo was in Amsterdam in 1597. It had been brought back as a present for the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II. In 2007, Australian singer Christine Anu, made an album called Chrissy's Island Family. This is a collection of songs for children. One of the songs is called Cassowary. It is about Samu, the Wakka Woo Cassowary. There is picture book for children, called Sisi and the Cassowary, by Arone Raymond Meeks. It has drawings in traditional aboriginal style to tell a Dreamtime like story. English natural history writer and artist, John Gould, had drawings of the cassowary in his set of seven books called The Birds of Australia. These were printed in London between 1851 and 1869. The cassowary drawings were completed by Henry Richter. Richter's watercolor painting of the cassowary is in the museum in Melbourne, Victoria. en:Cassowary",Easy

"Star The Rhine Gold isn't the only star article → Find more of them! The Rhine Gold (German: Das Rheingold) is a one-act opera. It is based on German and Scandinavian mythology. Richard Wagner wrote both the words and music. It is the first opera in his four-opera Ring cycle. This cycle tells the story of a hero named Siegfried and of a magic ring that gives its possessor power over the entire world. After a preview performance in Munich, Germany in 1869, The Rhine Gold officially premiered at the Bayreuther Festspielhaus in August 1876 with the other operas in the cycle. The performance of the complete Ring was a great success. Today, the Ring cycle is considered one of the monumental works of world art. The Rhine Gold is the first opera in Wagner's cycle of four operas called The Ring of the Nibelung. The cycle follows the life and deeds of the hero Siegfried, and depicts the end of the gods and their way of life. This disaster is brought about by a magic ring. Themes are greed, envy, deceit, and the redemptive power of a woman's love. The four operas in the cycle are The Rhine Gold, The Valkyrie, Siegfried, and Twilight of the Gods. Wagner started work on the Ring in 1848. He originally thought only to tell of Siegfried's death in an opera eventually called Twilight of the Gods. He decided though that the hero's entire life story had to be told. After completing the texts for the last three operas in the cycle, he decided to tell the story of events preceding the hero's life in a ""prelude"" opera, The Rhine Gold. With the texts complete, Wagner began the musical composition of the cycle in performance order. The first opera completed was The Rhine Gold. The completion of the Ring was interrupted by the composition of the operas Tristan and Isolde and The Mastersingers of Nuremberg. In 1875, the Bayreuther Festspielhaus was finished with funds from King Ludwig II of Bavaria. Wagner specifically intended this opera house for performances of the Ring. In 1876, the Ring was completed, and went into rehearsal. The Rhine Gold was first performed at the National Theatre in Munich, Germany on 22 September 1869. Wagner opposed this performance. He wanted the opera to premiere with the other operas in the cycle. His patron, King Ludwig II of Bavaria, however insisted upon this preview performance. The opera later received its premiere as part of the complete Ring cycle on 13 August 1876, in the Bayreuther Festspielhaus, Germany. This world premiere of the complete Ring was an artistic triumph. Today, the cycle is considered a monument of world art. The Gods Giants Niebelungs Rhine Maidens Scene 1 A fabulous treasure lies deep within the waters of the Rhine River. It is called the Rhine Gold. This gold is guarded by the three Rhine Maidens. The Nibelung dwarf, Alberich, wants the gold. The Rhine Maidens explain to him that whoever forges the gold into a ring will have complete power over the entire world. First, however, he must renounce love. Alberich flirts with the Rhine Maidens, but he is crude and ugly. The Rhine Maidens reject him as a sweetheart. Alberich renounces love, and steals the gold. Scene 2 The giants Fafner and Fasolt have built a fortress home for the gods. Wotan has promised to give Freia to them as payment for their labor. Wotan does not intend to honor his promise, and is looking for another way to pay the giants. In the meantime, Alberich has forged a ring from the Rhine Gold. He has enslaved his fellow Nibelung. Loge suggests that this ring (and Alberich's other treasures) be given to the giants instead of Freia. The giants accept this offer. They hold Freia hostage until the debt is paid. Scene 3 Loge and Wotan go to Alberich's underground home. Wotan takes the ring from him, as well as his other treasures. These treasures include a magic helmet called the Tarnhelm. Alberich curses the ring: worry and death shall be the fate of its possessor. Scene 4 The giants accept the treasure as payment. They release Freia. Wotan wants to keep the ring. Erda warns him that the ring will destroy the gods. He gives the ring to the giants. Fafner does not want to share the ring, and kills Fasolt. The Rhine Maidens are heard mourning the loss of the Rhine Gold. The gods enter their new home, Valhalla. This is where they hope to live in bliss for eternity, but the seeds of destruction have been sown.",Easy

"Moldova is a small country in south eastern Europe bordering Romania and Ukraine. The capital city is Chişinău. Other large cities are Tiraspol (located in the breakaway region of Transnistria) and Bălţi. It is one of the poorest country of Europe. Moldova is not part of the European Union and uses the Moldovan leu as its currency. Until 1991 Moldova was part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) The area east of the Dniester river, known as Transnistria, contains a majority of ethnic Ukrainians and Russians who did not wish to be part of Moldova. In 1992 military conflict occurred between Transistria and the Moldovan government and Transnistria declared itself independent although most countries in the world still recognise it as being part of Moldova. Transnistria's capital is Tiraspol. Since independent, the Communist Party has been the most popular party in Moldova until 2009 when a coalition took control. Moldova is the poorest country in Europe. The average income in the country is about $1,900 per year, far lower than central and western Europe and lower than other parts of eastern Europe. Moldova is located very close to the Black Sea but it does not touch the sea so it is one of Europe's landlocked countries. The country has a lot of hills but contains no mountains - the largest hill is Bălănești Hill at 430 metres. Because Moldova is close to the Black Sea it has warm and sunny summers but winters can be cold with average temperatures of −4 °C in mid-winter. The country has many rivers including Dniester (which separates Moldova from Transnistria) and Prut. Central Europe's largest river, the Danube, enters Moldovan territory for only half a kilometre. Moldova has a population of about 3.5 million. The official language of Moldova is Romanian. A large number of people, especially in the Transnistria region, speak Russian. The vast majority of Moldovans are Orthodox Christians. Moldova has many beautiful churches and monasteries. Because of poverty many Moldovans, as many as 25% of the population, work in other countries in Europe and send money home to their families. Tourism is increasing in Moldova especially since 2007 when new laws meant that EU citizens no longer need visas to visit the country.

"Alcohol is a word generally used to describe Ethylene Alcohol or Ethanol, which is the product found in alcoholic drinks, in certain food recipes, and in laboratories. The word Alcohol is also used to designate all alcoholic drinks, such as wine, beer and champagne. We sometimes say, for example, that whisky, is a very strong alcohol, to signify that it's a strongly alcoholic drink; the official term is spirits. In chemistry, the term alcohol designates an entire family of molecules, including those of a specific group: the Hydroxyl group (OH). Ethanol is a solvent with the chemical formula C2H6O, which permits the dissolution or dilution of numerous fatty and aromatic chemical substances. It can be mixed in all proportions with water. In its normal condition, it's a completely colourless liquid, which possesses a characteristic odour, and it's highly flammable. It evaporates very easily: if you get it on your skin, you can feel that it's cold. It is thanks to this property that we can distill alcohol. If you heat a mixture of ethanol and water, the ethanol evaporates much quicker than the water. If you pass the ethanol vapours through a cold tube, it permits the evaporated alcohol to become liquid again (condensation). The molecules of the alcohol family are characterised by a hydroxyl function, a group formed of one atom of Oxygen and one atom of Hydrogen (-OH). Modified camphorated ethanol - over the counter in pharmacies - is a good disinfectant. It destroys bacteria and many other microbes in an instant. But on damaged, cut, or scratched skin, ethanol stings a lot! On healthy skin, you feel a cold sensation (the cold is caused by the heat that ethanol absorbs to evaporate). It is this ethanol that the nurse uses on your skin before giving you an injection. Ethanol can also be used as a household solvent, to remove traces of glue, such as under a plaster for example. However, care must be taken to ventilate the room well: ethanol evaporates easily and the vapours from it can make you drunk. Ethanol is sometimes used as a fire starter for a barbecue. It is highly flammable and very dangerous! For some years now there have been cars and trucks in some countries around the world, such as Brazil, that can use an ethanol gasoline blend to operate. This ethanol is produced from cultivated plants such as sugar cane or rapeseed. It is a way of limiting the consumption of oil which is a non-renewable energetic resource. Ethanol is produced from the fermentation of sugars by a yeast. Most living organisms are able to convert ethanol to acetic acid. In humans, this mainly occurs in the liver. To produce an alcoholic beverage, you need a juice containing sugar (such as sucrose, which is powdered sugar) or starch, which is contained for example, in potatoes. A microbe is added to the juice which is capable of making alcoholic fermentation. The most common is brewer's yeast. Then, you have to wait varying lengths of time, depending on the sugar concentration and the strength of alcohol you want. In industry, it is possible to produce large quantities of ethanol from the cellulose contained in wood and plants. The process is complex but very efficient. Ethanol is a poison for all forms of life, which is why it is used as a disinfectant or local antiseptic in the form of modified camphorated alcohol. Ethanol destroys the membranes of cells, which kills them. If you ingest ethanol, the body tries to fight off the poison by turning it into Acetaldehyde and then Acetic acid (found in vinegar). Ethanol itself and Acetaldehyde are both poisons for cells, and more particularly for nerve cells: even at low concentration they disturb the functioning of nerves, which causes ""intoxication"" or ""drunkenness"". Drunkenness is a phenomenon where all normal reactions are slowed down, with or without changes in behaviour or disturbances of consciousness. The slowing of reactions can range from a simple lengthening of the reflexes to coma, then to death. It is the role of the liver to eliminate alcohol. The lungs are also involved in removing alcohol from the blood. A person who has drunk alcohol breathes some of it out. The amount he exhales is proportionate to the amount he has in the blood. We can therefore blow someone into a balloon and measure the level of alcohol ingested. This is useful for detecting people who have been drinking alcohol and driving a car, putting their lives and those of others at risk. Mammals can survive varying doses of ethanol. For example, a thimble of ethanol (a few millilitres) can kill a rabbit. If ethanol is introduced regularly and in small doses, the organism becomes able to survive in increasing doses. But the drunkenness remains, which endangers the drunken person and anyone with them because of their reduced reflexes (road accidents) and the modification of their behaviour (violent or aggressiveness). Regular consumption of ethanol causes changes in the body, which adapts to fight the poison. The main organ in this fight is the liver, which becomes exhausted and becomes ill (a condition called Cirrhosis). There may even be cancer of the liver. But other organs are affected: the heart, blood vessels, stomach, pancreas and the whole digestive tract, as well as the brain, which can suffer irreversible damage. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is very dangerous for a growing baby (foetus) which is unable to resist the toxic effects of alcohol. Babies which grow when a mother is drinking alcohol, are often born with learning or physical disabilities, such as deafness or blindness. This is an illness called Foetal Alcohol Syndrome. Alcohol is also used as a treatment for methanol poisoning. Ethanol is present in all alcoholic beverages, at a higher or lower concentration, such as cider, wine, etc. It comes from the fermentation of a juice, often from a plant rich in sugar, (apple juice, grape juice , but also potato) juice and sometimes even milk: the more sugar the juice contains, the more alcohol the drink obtained may contain. The ethanol concentration must appear on the bottle: it is measured in percent or in alcoholic degrees (proof). The various alcoholic drinks are traditionally served in specific glasses. Per type of drink the standard glass contains approximately 10 grams of alcohol. Thus, a cup or flute of champagne moderately filled (that is to say about 100 millilitres of liquid) contains as much alcohol as a glass of wine at 12% (that is to say, how much alcohol the drink contains). A glass of 5% beer on tap, or a bottle, or about 250 millilitres of liquid, also contains 10 grams of alcohol. A shot of whisky at 40% (or 30 millilitres of liquid) or a dose of pastis at 45% (or approximately 30 millilitres of liquid), also contain 10 grams of alcohol. Adding water or ice cubes to these last two drinks does not affect the amount of alcohol they contain. Regular consumption of ethanol is a disease called alcoholism or alcoholic illness. Alcohol is a drug, that is to say it modifies the perception that we have of the world by acting on the brain. Ethanol has been consumed for thousands of years (back to about 7000 BCE) for its actions on the soul. The modification of behaviour, consciousness and mood, as well as the relaxation perceived by the drunken person is sometimes experienced as pleasant (sometimes also unpleasant) but is addictive: after a short time, one cannot do without 'alcohol. This addiction is impossible to avoid, and very hard to lose. This is why it is very important to control how much alcohol you drink.",Easy
"Afrikaans is a Germanic language, spoken by 10.3 million people. It is one of the nine official languages of South Africa and a recognized minority language in Namibia.

The Greek army decisively defeated the more numerous Persians. The victory at Marathon marked the end of the first Persian invasion of Greece. The Persian force retreated to Asia. The Greeks realized with this victory that Persia could be defeated. The victory marked the beginning of the Classical Age in Greece.

He shouted the message and collapsed on the spot.

"Mesopotamia, from the Greek language, means 'land between rivers'. It includes the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers, and the fertile land which surrounds them. It is part of the Fertile Crescent. Mesopotamia today is split. Most of it is in Iraq, but parts are in Kuwait, Syria, Turkey and Iran. The area is often called the 'Cradle of Civilization'. The ancient writing called cuneiform was first used around 3000 BC by the Sumerians. They lived in city-states (a city and the land around it). According to Genesis in the Old Testament, Abraham lived in Mesopotamia before moving to Canaan. Historically important cities in Mesopotamia included Uruk, Nippur, Nineveh, and Babylon, as well as major territorial states such as the city of Ma-asesblu, the Akkadian kingdom, the Third Dynasty of Ur, and the Assyrian empire. Some of the important historical Mesopotamian leaders were Ur-Nammu (king of Ur), Sargon (who started the Akkadian Kingdom), Hammurabi (who established the Old Babylonian state), and Tiglath-Pileser I (who started the Assyrian Empire). Many advances in technology were made by the ancient Sumerians and Mesopotamians, such as irrigation, and trade by river, and flood control. Mesopotamians had agriculture and domesticated animals, or livestock, from the earliest records. Babylon is probably the first city built by settled people. Mesopotamia also was the place where the wheel was first used. First it was a pottery wheel that was used to make clay pots, then Sumerians adapted it for transport. Mesopotamia is made up of different regions. Northern Mesopotamia is made up of hills and plains. Seasonal rains, and the rivers and streams come from the mountains. Early settlers farmed the land and used timber, metals and stone. Southern Mesopotamia is made up of marshy areas and wide, flat, plains. Cities developed along the rivers which flow through the region. Early settlers had to irrigate the land along the banks of the rivers in order for their crops to grow. Mesopotamia has been conquered many times, by many different peoples. It was the heartland of the Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian and Assyrian empires. As each new group moved into the region they adopted some of the culture, traditions and beliefs of the people who had come before. It was conquered by Alexander the Great (332 BC), the Parthians (150 BC), the Romans, the Persian Empire, the Arabs (7th century). It is still one of the most fertile (and therefore valuable) parts of the Middle East. Ancient Mesopotamia begins in the late 6th millennium BC, and ends with either the rise of the Achaemenid Persians in the 6th century BC or the Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia in the 7th century CE. This long period may be divided as follows: The Epic of Gilgamesh is an ancient story about a relationship between Gilgamesh and his close companion, Enkidu. Enkidu is a wild man created by the gods as Gilgamesh's equal to distract him from oppressing the citizens of Uruk. Together they undertake dangerous quests that incur the displeasure of the gods. Firstly, they journey to the Cedar Mountain to defeat Humbaba, its monstrous guardian. Later they kill the Bull of Heaven that the goddess Ishtar has sent to punish Gilgamesh for turning down her advances. The second part of the epic is about Gilgamesh's distressed reaction to Enkidu's death, which takes the form of a quest for immortality. Gilgamesh attempts to learn the secret of eternal life by undertaking a long and perilous journey to meet the immortal flood hero, Utnapishtim. The words addressed to Gilgamesh in the midst of his quest foreshadow the end result:",Easy

"Crêpe Suzette is a French dessert. It consists of paper-thin crêpes, an orange flavored butter, a sauce of caramelized sugar, butter, orange juice, and zest, and an orange flavored liquor. The dish is usually flamed. The origin of the dish is disputed, but it was well known in the late 19th century. One legend says the dish was created in 1895 at the Maitre at the Café de Paris in Monte Carlo for the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII, and his guest, a beautiful French girl named Suzette. Fourteen year old waiter Henri Charpentier was waiting on the Prince's table and recalls in his autobiography: ""It was quite by accident as I worked in front of a chafing dish that the cordials caught fire. I thought it was ruined. The Prince and his friends were waiting. How could I begin all over? I tasted it. It was, I thought, the most delicious medley of sweet flavors I had ever tasted. I still think so. That accident of the flame was precisely what was needed to bring all those various instruments into one harmony of taste . . . He ate the pancakes with a fork; but he used a spoon to capture the remaining syrup. He asked me the name of that which he had eaten with so much relish. I told him it was to be called Crêpes Princesse. He recognized that the pancake controlled the gender and that this was a compliment designed for him; but he protested with mock ferocity that there was a lady present. She was alert and rose to her feet and holding her little skirt wide with her hands she made him a curtsey. 'Will you,' said His Majesty, 'change Crêpes Princesse to Crêpes Suzette?' Thus was born and baptized this confection, one taste of which, I really believe, would reform a cannibal into a civilized gentleman. The next day I received a present from the Prince, a jeweled ring, a panama hat and a cane."" One legends says it was named in honour of French actress Suzanne Reichenberg (1853–1924), who worked professionally under the name Suzette. In 1897 at the Comédie Française, she played a maid preparing crêpes. It was decided to flame the dish to keep it warm for the actors who were about to eat it. Several crêpes are spread with an orange juiceorange zest butter. The crêpes are folded into fourths and arranged in a chafing dish filled with a warm orangebutter sauce. The orange liquor is added and flamed. The crêpes are ready to serve, but vanilla ice cream, raspberries, strawberries, or other fruits are sometimes added.",Easy

"Buddha was a historical figure. He was the founder of the Buddhist religion, called Buddhism. ""Buddha"" is a word in the Sanskrit language which means ""Enlightened One"". Buddhists believe many Buddhas have lived in the past and will live in the future. Siddhartha Gautama lived in India sometime between the 6th and 4th century BCE. He was a prince who gave up his comfortable life of luxury to seek enlightenment (wisdom). He searched for seven years but did not find it. Then as he was meditating beneath a bodhi tree, he was enlightened. He found the ""middle way"" between extremes of behavior. Buddha died at Kusinara and escaped the endless circle of rebirth and suffering. In 1922, the German author Herman Hesse wrote a novel, Siddhartha: An Indian Poem. It tells of the title character who journeys in search of enlightenment at the time of Gautama Buddha, and the people he meets along the way.

"The Eurovision Song Contest (French: Concours Eurovision de la chanson) or Eurovision is international song contest which is every year held. In the contest, mostly every European country and some other countries have the chance to participate. Each country can send one artist (or group of artists) with an original song. The countries and the public (by televoting) choose the winner of that year. That winner has to host the next Eurovision Song Contest of the following year. The ESC is based on the Italian Sanremo Music Festival and is held since 1956, which is one of the longest running television events of the world. The contest is viewed in all participating countries and also in a lot of other countries via television and internet. Between 100 million and 600 million people view the ESC every year. Nearly every European country have participated at least one time, with exception of Liechtenstein and Vatican City, which have no public broadcasting or no interest. Also Australia, Morocco and Israel have taken or take place, although there not European countries. Countries can only participate if they have a public broadcasting. Originally, a song had to be song in an official language of the participating country. Ireland, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg and France had therefore high votes, for English and French are very common languages in Europe. Between 1973 and 1977 and since 1999 all countries can choose whatever language they would like to sing in. Very many countries choose to sing in English. Only some countries, like Italy, Spain and Serbia, choose to sing their own language. Ireland have won the most times (7), followed by Sweden (6), France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (all 5 times). Some countries haven't won a single contest, which are mostly new countries. Every year just one winner is chosen, only in 1969 there were four winners with the same amount of points.

"Barbie is best known as a toy doll. Starting as just a doll, Barbie became a brand. It is most common in the United States. It is named after a girl named Barbara. Barbara was the toy maker's daughter. Though the brand is most famous for the doll, other merchandise has been created with the Barbie name such as games, movies, videos, clothing, accessories, and books. The clothes and fashion accessories allow girls a taste of high fashion. Throughout the decades, Barbie has reflected and encouraged feminine growth in the workplace in the United States and been a miniature model of women worldwide. The doll has been criticized for causing self-image complexes, yet other companies continue to produce similar dolls. ""The Barbie doll is the biggest selling toy in the history of proprietary toy manufacturing."" On average, 172,000 dolls are sold by Mattel each day. ""Barbie always represented the fact that a woman has choices.""-Handler Barbie has portrayed more than one hundred twenty-five careers and fifty nationalities. When Barbara was a child, her parents saw she would rather play with paper dolls than dolls, so her mother created the Barbie doll. This information was later thought to be false as Barbara's mother had been contested by someone living near her, that she had created a much similar doll, Lilli, before she had. As there was no proof, Barbie remained. Ruth Handler was the creator of Barbie. Her parents were Polish Jewish immigrants. She was the tenth child. Her husband, Elliot Handler was the founder of Mattel in 1945, which is the largest toy company in the world. She originally wanted to name the doll ""Barbara"", after her daughter, or ""Bab's"" after her daughter's nickname. However, both those names were copyrighted. Barbie was first released on March 9, 1959 at a toy fair in New York after seven years of battling disagreements. At the time, Mattel was the third largest toy company in the United States. Ruth's display of Barbie was housed at the New Yorker Hotel in a hotel room, since so many businesses brought their toys to put on display. She had to halt the projected production that she assumed she would acquire in business orders at the fair. It was a disappointing day for Ruth and Barbie. In March 1959, Barbie debuted as a teen fashion model on television with more positive response leading the way for the dolls popularity rise. A blonde Barbie from this decade in mint condition has an appraisal price listing of five thousand-$5,250. The brunette Barbie that was made at the same time is worth $1,000 more than the blonde. In the 1960s Barbie's friends joined the line up of fashion dolls. Ken was her boyfriend and came to be in 1962. The Ken doll got his name from Ruth's son. Midge was her friend who was a redhead meeting the toy marketplace in 1963, a year after Ken. Allen was Ken's friend. Skipper was her little sister that was produced in 1964. Tutti and Todd were her twin siblings were introduced in 1966. Francie was her adult cousin. In 1967, Francie was changed into the first black Barbie doll causing consumers to believe it reflected the support of interracial marriages. Since this was during Civil Rights' time, she was not very successful. Twelve months later Mattel introduced Christie, the second black Barbie, who was much more accepted. Cara and Julia were also produced as Barbie's black friends. The roles of Barbie evolved as equality for women's rights progressed. The doll started in the 1960s portraying stereotypical female positions like teacher, stewardess, nurse, etc. A series of novels were also written introducing Barbie and her birthplace in the 60's. Bendable legs and swivel hips were introduced on Barbie in 1965. Jack Ryan created them. Hairstyles of the Barbie's in the 1960s were typically the classic bubble-cut hairstyle of the era taken from the First Lady of the early 60's Jackie Kennedy. The Barbie that is worth the most from this decade according to ""Schroeder's Collectible Toys"" is Color Magic Barbie made in 1967. Her hair and costume changes color. If it is complete with its cardboard box, it is worth $4,000. Children could purchase the new bendable Barbie's at a discounted rate if they wanted to trade in the old style in the 1970s. Christie's black boyfriend, Brad was introduced in 1970. Barbie's facial features were changed in 1971 from eyes cutting from the side and smile without teeth to eyes forward and a wide smile exposing teeth. This change occurred to keep current with the times representing a ""forward-thinking peace-and-love generation."" The first doctor Barbie appeared in 1973. Cara's boyfriend Brad reached the toy market in 1975. The flip hairstyle was a popular way for Barbie's hair to be styled in the 70's. The Sears' exclusive Dramatic New Living Skipper Very Best Velvet Barbie made in 1970-71 has the highest list price for the decade in ""Schroeder's Collectible Toys"" at $1,500.00. Hispanic and black Barbies were no longer featured as friends of Barbie's in the 1980s. They had reached the Barbie title in their own right. Magic Curl Barbie made its debut in 1982 feauting both black and white races. The first Asian doll produced representing Hong Kong in 1981 came from a mold with a rounder face and almond shaped eyes. A Japanese Barbie hit the market in 1985 as one of the first other nationalities offered with the collection of International Dolls of the World Barbies following its release. Barbie was made into a pilot in 1989. The doll could be viewed as opening the door for female acceptance in otherwise male dominant careers paving the way with astronaut Barbie debuting eighteen years prior to Sally Ride's first female in space endeavor. The 1980s also began the Holiday Barbie collection. The first one was produced in 1988 and its listed value is $325, which is $700 less than what it was worth in the 1990s. Shani, Asha, and Nichelle were produced to offer greater skin tone and facial feature selection to represent blacks more accurately in 1991.A hit single produced by the band Aqua entitled ""Barbie Girl"" climbed charts worldwide in 1997. Also in 1997, Puerto Rican Barbie debuted. Barbie's body measurements changed in 1998 due to consumer demand. Her breasts and hips were reduced and waist was widened. Race car driving NASCAR Barbie hit toy store shelves in 1998 and 1999 foreshadowing the first female race car driver Danica Patrick. Barbie was flashy and wore bright colors in the 90's. 1994's Barbie Snow Princess worth $1100 is the highest listed of the decade in ""Schroeder's Collectible Toys"". Since her late mother Ruth could not dip Barbie's hand and footprints in her concrete slab on Hollywood Boulevard in 2002, Barbara her daughter in which the doll was named after did the honors inducting the doll to superstar status. In 2006 a movie, ""The Tribe"" used Barbie to connect with being Jewish in America. In 2008, Barbie was transformed into a representation of African culture for the hundredth anniversary of the first African American sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha. 2009 brought about changes to the black Barbie adding fuller lips and altered facial features at the request of consumer complaints. Tricelle was given more textured and curlier hair. Chataine Barbie made in 2003 is worth $425 according to ""Schroeder's"". Some people believe Barbie gives girls a wrong idea of what they will look like when they grow up. If her doll size proportions were converted into life size body measurements (breast size, waist size, hip size) only 1 in 100,000 women would be able to obtain her figure. Though recent plastic surgery advancements has reduced that gap. Many people believe that the introduction of the Barbie doll was wrong due to the fact it made young girls believe they had to become skinny in order to be just like Barbie. The doll has been blamed for eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia. If a girl or woman was Barbie's actual size, she would suffer from back problems due to her breast size. She would also be unable to support her weight on her tiny feet making it impossible for her to walk. She is not supposed to be taken as a literal interpretation of a teenage girl. Barbie was not built to give girls an inferior complex when comparing themselves to the doll. She was built to be a longer lasting alternative to the easily torn paper dolls for hours of enjoyment reinacting life scenes through a child's creativity and imagination. Barbie is a teen doll, which gives little girls a peek at what might happen in their teen life. This was thought to be bad, because Barbie has lots of boyfriends. Ruth Handler, Barbie's creator, has been blamed for taking the Barbie doll design from a doll made in Germany in 1955, the Lilli doll that was sold mainly at tobacco shops for men post war. Lilli was originally a cartoon character in a tabloid newspaper in Germany created by Reinhard Beuthein in 1952. O.M. HausserElastolin Company had Max Weissbrodt, a doll maker of theirs get a patent for Lilli's limb design. Ruth is rumored to have purchased a few of the dolls while in Switzerland with her family. The Barbie doll has been in competition with other toy companies' doll designs. Ideal Toy and Novelty Company began making Tammy in 1962, American Character Doll Company challenged Barbie's sales in 1963 with Tressy, and Remco started producing the Littlechap Family in 1964. However, none had the popularity of Barbie. At the time of production, Tammy gave Barbie creators a financial scare. She was based on a movie character played by Debbie Reynolds. Instead of being surrounded with friends and boyfriends, the doll came with a mother and father, which might be why her popularity never surpassed Barbie's.  Barbie is a very big trend. She has had many sisters, boyfriends, and friends. She has dream houses and clothes. She has many jobs from teacher to doctor to astronaut. There have been many other dolls like Barbie since Barbie was first produced. Barbie also created MyScene dolls, a spoof of Bratz. The fact is the creator of Barbie, Ruth Handler, fought sexism and overcame her domesticated gender role to accomplish her goals in the business arena as a female by producing the world-famous Barbie doll.

"A verb is a kind of word (see part of speech) that usually tells about an action or a state and is the main part of a sentence. Every sentence has a verb. In English, verbs are the only kind of word that changes to show past or present tense. Every language in the world has verbs, but they are not always used in the same ways. They also can have different properties in different languages. For example, in some other languages (e.g., Chinese & Indonesian) verbs do not change for past and present tense. This means the definition above only works well for English verbs. There are sixteen verbs used in Basic English. They are: be, do, have, come, go, see, seem, give, take, keep, make, put, send, say, let, get. The word verb originally comes from *were-, a Proto-Indo-European word meaning ""a word"". It comes to English through the Latin verbum and the Old French verbe. In simple sentences, the verb may be one word: The cat sat on the mat. However, the verb may be a whole phrase: The cat will sit on the mat. Verbal phrases can be extremely difficult to analyse: I'm afraid I will need to be going soon. There seem to be three verbal phrases here, which add to something like Sorry, I must go soon. In English and many other languages, verbs change their form. This is called inflection. Most English verbs have six inflected forms (see the table), but be has eight different forms. You should notice that some of the verb forms look the same. You can say they have the same shape. For example, the plain present and the plain form of walk have the same shape. The same is true for the past and the past participle. But these different forms can have different shapes in other verbs. For example, the plain present of be is usually are but the plain form is be. Also, the past of eat is ate, but the past participle is eaten. When you look for a verb in the dictionary, it is usually the plain form that you look for. An English sentence must have at least one primary-form verb. Each main clause can only have one primary-form verb. English has two main kinds of verbs: normal verbs (called lexical verbs) and auxiliary verbs. The difference between them is mainly in where they can go in a sentence. Some verbs are in both groups, but there are very few auxiliary verbs in English. There are also two kinds of auxiliary verbs: modal verbs and non-modal verbs. The table below shows most of the English auxiliaries and a small number of other verbs. There are several auxiliary verbs: The follow verbs are modal auxiliaries Auxiliary verbs also inflect for negation. Usually this is done by adding not or n't. Sometimes the verb do. It does not really change the meaning. It is also used in the negative when no other auxiliary verbs are used. Many other languages do not use the verb do as an auxiliary verb. They use the simple present for do, and the simple past or perfect for 'did Many people think that all different ways of using verbs are all different tenses. This is not true. There are three main systems related to the verb: tense, aspect, and mood. Tense is mainly used to say when the verb happens: in the past, present, or future. In order to explain and understand tense, it is useful to imagine time as a line on which past tense, present tense and future tense are positioned. Some languages have all three tenses, some have only two, and some have no tenses at all. English and Japanese for example have only two tenses: past and present. Chinese and Indonesian verbs do not show tense. Instead they use other words in the sentence to show when the verb happens. Aspect usually shows us things like whether the action is finished or not, or if something happens regularly. English has two aspects: progressive and perfect. In English, aspect is usually shown by using participle verb forms. Aspect can combine with present or past tense. English uses the gerund-participle, usually together with the auxiliary be (and its forms am, is, are, was, and were) to show the progressive aspect. Many other languages, such as French, do not use progressive tenses. The past perfect can be used to express an unrealized hope, wish, etc. After If, wish and would rather, the past perfect can be used to talk about past events that never happened. Finally, English mood is now usually shown by using modal verbs. In the past, English had a full mood system but that has almost completely disappeared. The subjunctive mood now uses the plain form. There is also a form of be that is used in conditionals to show that something is not true (e.g., If I were a bird, I would fly to California.) Certain parts of a sentence naturally come before verbs or after them, but these are not always the same for all verbs. The main sentence parts are: subject, object, complement, and modifier. Almost all English sentences have subjects, but sentences that are orders (called imperatives) usually do not have any subjects. A subject usually comes before a verb, but it can also come after auxiliary verbs. In the following examples, the subject is underlined and the primary verb is in bold. Many verbs can be followed by an object. These verbs are called transitive verbs. In fact, some verbs must have an object (e.g., take), but some verbs never take an object (e.g., sleep). Verbs that do not take an object are called intransitive verbs. Some verbs can even have two objects. They are called ditransitive verbs. In the following examples, the object is underlined and the primary verb is in bold. Some verbs can or must be followed by a complement. These verbs are called linking verbs or copula. In the following examples, the complement is underlined and the verb is in bold. Verbs can be modified by various modifiers, mainly adverbs. Note that verbs generally do not need modifiers; it's usually a choice. In the following examples, the adverb is underlined and the verb is in bold. Verbs also commonly take a variety of other modifiers including prepositions. Sometimes a verb and another word can have the same shape. In these cases you can usually see the difference by looking at various properties of the words. Sometimes a verb and an adjective can have the same shape. Usually this happens with participles. For example, the present participle interesting and the adjective interesting look the same. Verbs are different from adjectives, though, because they cannot be modified by very, more, or most. For example, you can say ""That is very interesting,"" so you know interesting is an adjective here. But you cannot say ""My teacher is very interesting me in math"" because in this sentence interesting is a verb. On the other hand, if you cannot change the 'be' verb to 'seem' or 'become', it is probably a verb. The gerund-particle sometimes looks like a noun. This is especially true when it is used as a subject, as in the following example: The main differences between these verbs and nouns are: modifiers, number, and objectcomplement Verbs cannot generally be modified by adjectives and nouns cannot generally be modified by adverbs. So, in ""Running regularly is good for you"", running is a verb because it is modified by regularly, an adverb. Verbs cannot change for number, so if you can make the word plural, it is a noun, not a verb. For example, ""this drawing is nice"" can change to ""these drawings are nice"", so drawing is a noun. But ""drawing trees is fun"" cannot change to ""drawings trees is fun"", so it is a verb here. Many verbs can take objects or complements, but nouns cannot. So, in ""parking the car is hard"", parking is a verb because it takes the object the car. But, if you say, ""there's no parking"", parking may be a noun because it does not have an object. Some verbs have become prepositions. Again, usually these share a shape with participles. Here are some examples: The main difference between verbs and prepositions is that verbs have a subject. Even if the subject is not written, you can understand what it is. Prepositions do not have a subject.",Easy
"World War I (known as The Great War before World War II) was a war that lasted from 1914 to 1918. It mainly took place in Europe. Before it ended, 135 countries had been involved in World War I, some of the countries were France, The British Empire, Russia, United States, Romania, The Empire of Japan and Serbia, more than 15 million people died. World War I started with the so-called arm race in Europe when countries like Germany, the United Kingdom and Russia increased their military power. Alliances were also created and caused great disturbance in Europe as they contributed not only to the start of World War I but also to its extension. An example of this is when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, leading to other countries and their alliances to join battle. At the same time, countries in Europe became greedier wanting to increase their wealth and power. Their desire for greater empires led to additional confrontation and tension between them. The assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand led to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia, and Germany on Russia, which marked the beginning of World War I on August 4th, 1914. Conscription, also known as ""the draft"", is when a government forces people to join the armed forces. So, because not enough people signed up, conscription was introduced to many countries. This meant you could be asked to join the army or another military branch at any time. Once you were asked, it was hard to get out. It was introduced in 1916 in the United Kingdom and in 1917 in the United States.",Easy

"Quartiere Quadronno is a district (""quartiere"") of Milan, Italy, called also Quartiere Quadronno-Guastalla. It is located within the Zone 1 (the historical core of the city) and it is centred on Via Quadronno. Quadronno is the coolest, high luxury residential neighbourhood in Milan. The name stems from Medieval Italian ""Cadronno"" derived from Old Lombardic meaning the name of a beautiful, blue river that surrounded the area. Quadronno was the only area within the defensive walls of Milan, in which plants and trees grew, in particular sacred mulberry plants. Usually inside the defensive walls there were no trees to have visibility for safety of the city. Quadronno is the best neighborhood for feeling a luxury vip ""milanese"". The entire Brera district has the aura of an aristocratic cultured nobility. The neighborhood includes various buildings of global interest, such as the palaces of star architects from the 1950s who created the design system in Italy, mainly in the Italian rationalist style and in the MAC-Movimento Arte Concreta movement. It is, after the Milan Cathedral, the most important religious building in the history of Milan. The oldest mention of the church is found in an epigram of bishop Ennodius in 474-521. It is a basilica of early Christian origin, dedicated to one of the first bishops of Milan, adjacent to the Diocesan Historical Archives and a stone's throw from the Convent of the Visitation. In the excavations carried out in 1905 during which some bricks dating back to the factory of King Theodoric (493-526) were found. It also seems that a temple of Apollo stood near or in its place, information that can be obtained from the ""De situ civitatis Mediolani"", a text from the 9th-10th century. From inside the church you can go down into the entirely frescoed crypt, in which there is the well of San Calimero, where, as has been handed down to us, Calimero, then the fourth bishop of Milan. The church was built around the well and according to legend on July 31st, the feast day of San Calimero, the water from the well was given to the sick to drink because it was believed to be miraculous. What remains of the ancient church today is above all the sixteenth-century crypt, with a vault frescoed by the Fiammenghini. Furthermore, a small fresco survives (Madonna between two saints, 15th century, attributed to Cristoforo Moretti), a Crucifixion by Cerano and a Nativity by Marco d'Oggiono (altered by recent repaintings which make it illegible in several places, but which demonstrates how d'Oggiono was inspired by the Master Leonardo da Vinci). Other medieval frescoes are found in the adjacent sacristy. Other important works are the neoclassical main altar with a circular ciborium supported by Corinthian columns; Altar of Sant'Arialdo da Carimate with a bas-relief depicting Saint Erlembaldo Cotta. For the modern frescoes, the painter Augusto Lozzia (1896 – 1962) lent his mastery; On the choir loft to the left of the presbytery, behind a three-light window supported by small columns, there is the pipe organ, built by Giuseppe Bernasconi in 1884 and restored by the Mascioni company in 2014. The street art is very present in Quadronno, in a real open air museum, in via San Calimero, the street located between via Santa Sofia and Via Francesco Sforza, next to the church of San Calimero is the old rectory building, whose façade was entirely repainted by the street artist Ivan Tresoldi, famous for his poems scattered on the walls of the city. The mural is a Gothic-inspired black and red writing that seems to have come from a page of an ancient manuscript. The work was commissioned with other names of important artists like Paolo Bordino and Laura Pasquazzo, by the Gaetano Pini orthopedic institute which, to celebrate its 140th anniversary, with the support of the Cariplo Foundation and the patronage of the Municipality of Milan, developed Wall Art. Ivan Tresoldi's, known as the graffiti poet, murals continue on the façade of the Diocesan Archive adjacent to the rectory, while on the other side of the square, along the wall of the Gaetano Pini hospital, Wall Art unfolds, the very long street art work by Orticanoodles (Walter Contipelli and Alessandra Montanari): 14 Milanese celebrities depicted in shades of brown and yellow, interspersed with equally famous quotes.

The Aras river is the largest and longest river in Armenia. It starts off in the mountains of Turkey and flows along Armenia's border with Turkey and Iran. The climate of Armenia is mostly dry with long, hot summers and average winters. The sun shines most of the time in Armenia which causes the dry climate, but they do receive heavy rains.

"The air is composed of a mixture of several gases and forms the Earth's atmosphere. The most important gas by quantity is nitrogen (more precisely dinitrogen, N2) which represents 78% or more than 34 of the air. It's an inert gas, which is to say that it cannot have a chemical reaction with other things, and only certain types of mushrooms can use it directly. The next component is dioxygen (O2), more often called oxygen, which represents 21% of the air. It's the one we take in when we breathe. It also allows fire to burn: it's oxidising. Argon (Ar) represents a bit less than 1%; carbon dioxide or carbonic gas, 0,038%. following up, there are other gases making up even smaller parts of the air The quantity of CO2 was 0.028% before the Industrial Revolution started in Europe. Since it is a gas which contributes to the greenhouse effect, its increase is considered a main cause of the global warming, i.e. a long-term increase in average temperatures on Earth as measured over many decades. The air also contains several rare gases. In decreasing percentages, these are: neon, helium, nitrogen monoxide, krypton, methane, dihydrogen, nitrogen protoxide, xenon, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, radon. In addition to these ""permanent"" gases, there is water vapour in the air (between zero and 7%). Water vapour is no more visible than a gas. When we see it, for example as a cloud, then it means that the vapour actually turned into very small drops of liquid water (so it's no longer a gas). Air does have a mass, and for a large volume, this mass is very significant. Under ordinary conditions, the mass of a cubic meter of air is about 1.2kg. This means that a room 3 meters wide, 4 meters long and 2.5 meters high contains 36kg of air. On Earth, the air is responsible for atmospheric pressure.",Easy

"Star Saint Patrick's Day isn't the only star article → Find more of them! Saint Patrick's Day is the feast day of St Patrick. It is the day of St Patrick's death, and commemorates the arrival of Christianity in Ireland. The day is observed by the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Lutheran Church, and people of Irish descent around the world. Not much is known about St Patrick. He was born in Roman Britain to a wealthy family in the 5th century. Patrick was 16 years old when he was captured by Irish raiders and taken into Ireland. He escaped after six years of slavery, and returned to Britain. In later years, he went back to Ireland to teach and Christianize the Irish at great risk to his personal safety. He used a shamrock to teach the concept of the Trinity. Legend says he drove the snakes out of Ireland. St. Patrick died on 17 March. He is said to be buried at Down Cathedral in Downpatrick, County Down. In places where the day is observed, people attend mass, then turn the day over to celebrating and feasting. Most Irish people wear something green on the day like a tie, hair ribbon, or shamrock. The phrase ""the wearing of the green"" means to wear a shamrock on one's clothing. New York City, Boston, Dublin, and many other places have parades with a local celebrity (such as the police chief or mayor) acting as Grand Marshal.

"Florence Nightingale, (12 May 1820 – 13 August 1910), was an English nurse. She helped create the modern techniques of nursing. She became a leader of the team of nurses who helped wounded soldiers during the Crimean War. She was the first female to receive the Order of Merit, the highest honour awarded to a British person. As a nurse she was given the name 'The Lady with the Lamp' because at night, she checked on the wounded soldiers and always carried 'The Lamp' with her. She helped make modern nursing possible. Nightingale wrote a lot. She lived to be 90 years old. In her lifetime she was concerned with spreading medical knowledge. Some of her books were written in simple English so that they could easily be understood by those with poor reading skills. She also was an early user of graphs and diagrams to display data. Nightingale was helped to understand statistics by her country's leading expert on public statistics, William Farr. He was a founder of medical statistics, and epidemiology. Farr worked with her on all the statistics from the Crimean War, which she publicised in her writing. She proved that more men had died from disease than fighting, a very important piece of information. The disease in question was mostly cholera. Cholera is caused by a bacterium which is spread by people drinking water which is contaminated by sewage. Unfortunately, both she and Farr believed the disease was caused by foul air: this was called the miasma theory. The miasma theory was refuted by John Snow, who discovered the real cause of an outbreak in London. The cause was foul water from a water pump in Broad Street, London. Snow's work was published in 1855, but it was 30 years before the germ theory was generally accepted. Farr publicly acknowledged he was wrong in 1866, but Nightingale never really gave up the miasma idea. London's cholera epidemics stopped once the authorities built sewage treatment plants, delivered cleaner water, and built a system of underground pipes which kept sewage from seeping into the water supply. Florence Nightingale was born into an upper class British family in 1820 in Florence, Tuscany, Italy. She was named after the town where she was born. The family moved back to London when Florence was a young girl. She was a Unitarian. Although her parents expected her to become a wife and a mother, in 1845 she decided to become a nurse. While she was training she campaigned for better conditions for poor people in Britain. In 1854 when the Crimean War began, Florence was working in Harley Street in London. After reading many reports about the poor treatment of sick and injured soldiers, she travelled to Crimea to see for herself and discovered the hospitals were crowded and dirty. She knew Sidney Herbert, who was Secretary of War during the Crimean War and he helped her. At the hospital in Istanbul where the injured soldiers were sent, Florence realized that soldiers died more often from diseases like cholera than from their injuries in war. She used her knowledge of maths and statistics to show the British government that providing better conditions for sick and injured soldiers would help them win the war. She was, however, quite wrong about how cholera spread. There is a syndrome named after her called ""Florence Nightingale Syndrome"". It occurs when a soldier falls in love with a nurse. While she was working in Crimea she became known as “The Lady with the Lamp” because she would walk around the hospital in the evening carrying a lamp and check on the soldiers. When she returned to England she started a school in 1860 for nurses at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London. She wrote her most important book Notes on Nursing. She was a keen Christian but also believed that pagan and eastern religions also contained genuine worth. She was a strong opponent of discrimination against all types of Christians as well as against non-Christians. Nightingale believed religion helped provide people with the fortitude for arduous good work. In 1907, Florence Nightingale became the first woman to be awarded the Order of Merit by King Edward VII. Nightingale died in 1910 in London. There are many statues of her in Britain, including one in Waterloo Place in London and a Florence Nightingale museum, also in London.",Easy

"A castle is a fortified structure from the Middle Ages that housed and protected people from their enemies. A castle belonged to royalty or nobility. The building was typically made of stone with tall, thick walls due to the kind of warfare of that time. The owner of the castle was a king or lord who ruled the local area and owned the land around it. The peasants (also called serfs) lived on the land and were farmers or artisans. They provided goods and services to the castle ruler in exchange for protection. They could also be drafted to be soldiers either to defend the castle or attack the ruler's enemies. A typical castle had many protective architectural features. The castle's defenders would patrol the rooftop, watching for the approach of attackers. When an attacking force neared, a drawbridge controlled by guards would be lifted. The surrounding moat filled with water prevented anyone getting close enough to the walls for setting up ladders. Soldiers could shoot arrows at attackers on the ground. There were two main ways to attack a castle. One is to lay siege, preventing anyone from going in or coming out so that the people inside would risk starvation. Attacking the castle walls and within required using powerful weapons, such as the catapault, to launch projectiles at or over the walls. Such weapons were used as early as Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire. With the passage of centuries, castles are mainly no longer inhabited. Many have fallen into disrepair or even ruin. Because of the historical importance of castles, efforts are made to restore them and maintain them. The expenses are covered by the government or special funds set up for this purpose.

Turin was particularly important in the history of the Italy: It was indeed the capital of the Savoy duchy and was the capital of Italy from 1861 to 1865. It is an important car manufacturing city and also an important center for media (telecommunications), cinema, design and sport.

The history of Turin started in the 2nd century Before Christ, when on the banks of the river Po, the first Celtic tribe settled, looking for arable plains. These tribes were called Taurisc: hence the word ""Torino"" and the nickname ""city of the tauri (latin for bulls)"". It became a Roman city in 28 B.C. under the name of Augusta Taurinorum. In those times, it was a military centre surrounded by walls and with a square plant. After the fall of the Roman empire, it passed under the control of the Ostrogoths, the Lombards and the Franks. This is one of the darkest historical periods of the city. In the XV century it became the capital of Savoy; this contributed to its expansion. In the 17th century, the city widened by buying Montferrat, which allowed to have an outlet to the sea. In 1706, French troops besieged Turin: the siege was interrupted by the arrival of the Austrian soldiers. In 19th century, Turin was the centre of the Italian Risorgimento with Vittorio Emmanuele II, King of the Savoy dynasty, Camillo Benso Count of Cavour, Giuseppe Garibaldi, men who managed to unify Italy. Thus, in 1861, Turin became the first capital of the Kingdom of Italy (which lasted until 1865). Torino is the second province in Italy for export values.

"Quartiere Quadronno is a district (""quartiere"") of Milan, Italy, called also Quartiere Quadronno-Guastalla. It is located within the Zone 1 (the historical core of the city) and it is centred on Via Quadronno. Quadronno is the coolest, high luxury residential neighbourhood in Milan. The name stems from Medieval Italian ""Cadronno"" derived from Old Lombardic meaning the name of a beautiful, blue river that surrounded the area. Quadronno was the only area within the defensive walls of Milan, in which plants and trees grew, in particular sacred mulberry plants. Usually inside the defensive walls there were no trees to have visibility for safety of the city. Quadronno is the best neighborhood for feeling a luxury vip ""milanese"". The entire Brera district has the aura of an aristocratic cultured nobility. The neighborhood includes various buildings of global interest, such as the palaces of star architects from the 1950s who created the design system in Italy, mainly in the Italian rationalist style and in the MAC-Movimento Arte Concreta movement. It is, after the Milan Cathedral, the most important religious building in the history of Milan. The oldest mention of the church is found in an epigram of bishop Ennodius in 474-521. It is a basilica of early Christian origin, dedicated to one of the first bishops of Milan, adjacent to the Diocesan Historical Archives and a stone's throw from the Convent of the Visitation. In the excavations carried out in 1905 during which some bricks dating back to the factory of King Theodoric (493-526) were found. It also seems that a temple of Apollo stood near or in its place, information that can be obtained from the ""De situ civitatis Mediolani"", a text from the 9th-10th century. From inside the church you can go down into the entirely frescoed crypt, in which there is the well of San Calimero, where, as has been handed down to us, Calimero, then the fourth bishop of Milan. The church was built around the well and according to legend on July 31st, the feast day of San Calimero, the water from the well was given to the sick to drink because it was believed to be miraculous. What remains of the ancient church today is above all the sixteenth-century crypt, with a vault frescoed by the Fiammenghini. Furthermore, a small fresco survives (Madonna between two saints, 15th century, attributed to Cristoforo Moretti), a Crucifixion by Cerano and a Nativity by Marco d'Oggiono (altered by recent repaintings which make it illegible in several places, but which demonstrates how d'Oggiono was inspired by the Master Leonardo da Vinci). Other medieval frescoes are found in the adjacent sacristy. Other important works are the neoclassical main altar with a circular ciborium supported by Corinthian columns; Altar of Sant'Arialdo da Carimate with a bas-relief depicting Saint Erlembaldo Cotta. For the modern frescoes, the painter Augusto Lozzia (1896 – 1962) lent his mastery; On the choir loft to the left of the presbytery, behind a three-light window supported by small columns, there is the pipe organ, built by Giuseppe Bernasconi in 1884 and restored by the Mascioni company in 2014. The street art is very present in Quadronno, in a real open air museum, in via San Calimero, the street located between via Santa Sofia and Via Francesco Sforza, next to the church of San Calimero is the old rectory building, whose façade was entirely repainted by the street artist Ivan Tresoldi, famous for his poems scattered on the walls of the city. The mural is a Gothic-inspired black and red writing that seems to have come from a page of an ancient manuscript. The work was commissioned with other names of important artists like Paolo Bordino and Laura Pasquazzo, by the Gaetano Pini orthopedic institute which, to celebrate its 140th anniversary, with the support of the Cariplo Foundation and the patronage of the Municipality of Milan, developed Wall Art. Ivan Tresoldi's, known as the graffiti poet, murals continue on the façade of the Diocesan Archive adjacent to the rectory, while on the other side of the square, along the wall of the Gaetano Pini hospital, Wall Art unfolds, the very long street art work by Orticanoodles (Walter Contipelli and Alessandra Montanari): 14 Milanese celebrities depicted in shades of brown and yellow, interspersed with equally famous quotes.

"The Sahara in North Africa, is the one of the largest deserts in the world. The Sahara has about the same size as the whole United States. It has been both larger and smaller at different times. After the last ice age it became more fertile, then dried up again. Most parts are uninhabited, but some people manage to survive in places where there is water. It is the hottest place on the Earth, but the driest place is the Atacama Desert in South America. It is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the Atlas Mountains, the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Sahel region. Inside it are parts of many countries, including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad, and The Sudan. The highest mountain is 3415 m, and is the Emi Koussi in Chad. Some mountain peaks in the Sahara Desert have snow even in the summer. The main mountain ranges is the Atlas Mountains in Algeria. The Sahara's lowest point lies in the Qattara Depression in Egypt, at about 130 metres below sea level. An erg (also sand sea or dune sea, or sand sheet if it lacks dunes) is a broad, flat area of desert covered with wind-swept sand with little or no vegetative cover. An erg is defined as a desert area that contains more than 125 square kilometres (48 sq mi) of aeolian or wind-blown sand and where sand covers more than 20% of the surface. Smaller areas are known as ""dune fields"". Sand seas and dune fields are about 25% of the Sahara. It is a desert rocky surface. see: reg or desert pavement Hoggar in Algeria (photography taken in December) Desert pavement in Mauritania (photography taken in January) Sand dunes in the Sahara desert (photography taken in January) Hammada in western Egypt (photography taken in March) There are several rivers running through the Sahara. However, most of them (wadis) come and go through the seasons, they flow only after rain, except for the Nile River and Niger River. Metallic minerals are very important to most Saharan countries. Algeria and Mauritania have several major deposits of iron ore. There are also bits of uranium, while Niger has the largest parts of them. A lot of phosphates are in Morocco and Western Sahara. Oil is mainly found in Algeria. The oil is very important to the economy of the entire country. While the mineral exploitation has led to economic growth in Sahara, this has rarely helped the indigenous population, as skilled workers have been brought from other countries. Of the Sahara's around 4 million people, most live in Mauritania, Western Sahara, Algeria, Libya and Egypt. Dominant groups of people are Sahrawis, Tuareg and Negroids. The largest city is Nouakchott, Mauritania's capital. Other important cities are Tamanrasset in Algeria, and Sebha and Ghat in Libya. The soil in Sahara is low in organic matter. The soil in depressions is often saline.Only 200,000km² of Sahara are fertile oases, where dates, corn, and fruits are grown. The few fertile regions today are fed by underground rivers and underground basins. Many of Sahara's oases rests in depressions (areas under sea level) allowing water to surface from underground reservoirs; artesian wells. Animal life is limited to gazelles, antelopes, jackals, sand foxes, badgers and hyena. Animal life of Sahara include gerbil, jerboa, cape hare and desert hedgehog, barbary sheep, oryx, deer, wild ass, weasel and mongoose. The bird life counts more than 300 species. Other sorts of vegetation include scattered concentrations of grasses, shrubs and trees in the highlands, as well as in the oases and along river beds. Some plants are well adjusted to the climate, allowing them to germinate within 3 days of rain and sow their seeds within 2 weeks after that. Adapted from the Simple English Wikipedia: Sahara ",Easy

"Nupedia was an English-language online encyclopedia. Its articles were written by volunteers and checked by experts. They were licensed as open content. It was founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Nupedia was online from March 2000 until September 2003. It is mostly known as the website which came before Wikipedia. Unlike Wikipedia, Nupedia was not a wiki. It also had a long peer-review process for all of its articles. This was supposed to make its articles as good as professional encyclopedias. Nupedia wanted scholars to help build it. Before it shut down, Nupedia had 25 articles that completed its own review routine. In June 2008, CNET said that Nupedia was one of the greatest closed websites in Internet history. In late 1999, Jimmy Wales began thinking about an online encyclopedia built by volunteers. In January 2000, he hired Larry Sanger to manage it. The project went online on March 9, 2000. By November 2000, only two full articles had been published. From when it started, Nupedia was a free-content encyclopedia. Bomis, Jimmy Wales' company, was going to get money from adverts on the Nupedia website. At first, the project used a license that was made up by Wales and Sanger. Later, it began using the Nupedia Open Content License. In January 2001, it switched to the GNU Free Documentation License. This was because Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation said they should. Also in January 2001, Nupedia started Wikipedia. At first, it was not meant to be an encyclopedia. Instead, it was meant as a side-project to allow people to work on articles for Nupedia before they were peer-reviewed. As Wikipedia got bigger and attracted new users, it began to run without Nupedia. However, Larry Sanger first led an activity on Wikipedia. This was because he was the chief editor of Nupedia. Wikipedia led to the gradual shutdown of Nupedia. Jimmy Wales decided to stop paying Sanger in December 2001. Sanger then left both Nupedia and Wikipedia. After Sanger left, Nupedia became even less noticed than Wikipedia. As Nupedia was used less and less, the idea of changing its articles into Wikipedia articles was sometimes proposed. However, it was never done. After it closed down, Nupedia's articles were moved into Wikipedia. Nupedia's articles were all peer-reviewed. These were the steps they had to follow: Assignment Finding a lead reviewer Lead review Open review Lead copyediting (when articles had their grammar, punctuation, and layout changed to look better) Open copyediting Final approval and markup People who wrote for Nupedia were supposed to be experts in what they wrote about. However, some articles could be written by a good writer, rather than an expert.

"Jerusalem (in Hebrew: ירושלים) is a city in the Middle East. It is about 4,800 years old. Jerusalem is claimed by two countries as their capital: the State of Israel and the State of Palestine. It is a holy city for the Jewish religion from biblical times and the location of the Temple, and consequently important to the later religions of Christianity and Islam. The city of Jerusalem was founded most likely by the Canaanites, who lost it to the Jews in their conquest of Canaan. It became the capital of the nation of Judah, and continued to be the capital after Judah broke into Judah and Israel. Much of the city had been improved by King Solomon, who constructed a large temple considered by some to be the most important temple of the Jewish religion and the world. Jerusalem was sacked by the Babylonians in their conquest of Judah, and much of it was destroyed. It was returned to the Jews by the Persians, and later made a part of Alexander the Great's empire, and even later part of the Roman Empire. During the Roman Empire, it was an important city for the Jews, and Jesus conducted many ministries there. After the end of World War I, the League of Nations mandates France and Great Britain to administer the Arabic regions of the defeated Ottoman Empire: Syria and Lebanon are then under French mandate; Palestine, Transjordan and Iraq are under British mandate. Jerusalem was then the capital of the British Mandate of Palestine, from its establishment in 1920 until its end in 1948. When preparing the expiry of the British Mandate of Palestine, the United Nations voted the so-called Partition Plan for Palestine in 1947 recommending the creation of two independent states, a Jewish one and an Arab one. A small territory including Jerusalem and Bethlehem would bear special international status for another 10 years before its population would decide on its destiny. Shortly after this decision, civil war broke out in Palestine and the UN plan was never implemented. When the British mandate actually expired mid May 1948, the Jewish State of Israel was immediately created and started conquer territory. An Arab state wasn't created; neighbouring countries opposed Israeli in what's called the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Within about ten months, Israel conquered a big part of the country, including part of Jerusalem (which would then be known as West Jerusalem). Jordan took control on the Eastern part of the country and the remaining part of Jerusalem (becoming known as East Jerusalem), including the old walled city. During the Six-Days War in 1967, Israel conquered East Jerusalem. Today, Israel considers Jerusalem as its capital but the international community doesn't recognize this status as legitimate because the Eastern part of the city was annexed illegally: it considers the status of Jerusalem to be agreed between parties as part of the resolution of the whole Israel-Palestine conflict. Indeed, Palestinians also consider Jerusalem as the capital of their State, although they say they would be open to a solution where Jerusalem would have a special status.",Easy

"A verb is a kind of word (see part of speech) that usually tells about an action or a state and is the main part of a sentence. Every sentence has a verb. In English, verbs are the only kind of word that changes to show past or present tense. Every language in the world has verbs, but they are not always used in the same ways. They also can have different properties in different languages. For example, in some other languages (e.g., Chinese & Indonesian) verbs do not change for past and present tense. This means the definition above only works well for English verbs. There are sixteen verbs used in Basic English. They are: be, do, have, come, go, see, seem, give, take, keep, make, put, send, say, let, get. The word verb originally comes from *were-, a Proto-Indo-European word meaning ""a word"". It comes to English through the Latin verbum and the Old French verbe. In simple sentences, the verb may be one word: The cat sat on the mat. However, the verb may be a whole phrase: The cat will sit on the mat. Verbal phrases can be extremely difficult to analyse: I'm afraid I will need to be going soon. There seem to be three verbal phrases here, which add to something like Sorry, I must go soon. In English and many other languages, verbs change their form. This is called inflection. Most English verbs have six inflected forms (see the table), but be has eight different forms. You should notice that some of the verb forms look the same. You can say they have the same shape. For example, the plain present and the plain form of walk have the same shape. The same is true for the past and the past participle. But these different forms can have different shapes in other verbs. For example, the plain present of be is usually are but the plain form is be. Also, the past of eat is ate, but the past participle is eaten. When you look for a verb in the dictionary, it is usually the plain form that you look for. An English sentence must have at least one primary-form verb. Each main clause can only have one primary-form verb. English has two main kinds of verbs: normal verbs (called lexical verbs) and auxiliary verbs. The difference between them is mainly in where they can go in a sentence. Some verbs are in both groups, but there are very few auxiliary verbs in English. There are also two kinds of auxiliary verbs: modal verbs and non-modal verbs. The table below shows most of the English auxiliaries and a small number of other verbs. There are several auxiliary verbs: The follow verbs are modal auxiliaries Auxiliary verbs also inflect for negation. Usually this is done by adding not or n't. Sometimes the verb do. It does not really change the meaning. It is also used in the negative when no other auxiliary verbs are used. Many other languages do not use the verb do as an auxiliary verb. They use the simple present for do, and the simple past or perfect for 'did Many people think that all different ways of using verbs are all different tenses. This is not true. There are three main systems related to the verb: tense, aspect, and mood. Tense is mainly used to say when the verb happens: in the past, present, or future. In order to explain and understand tense, it is useful to imagine time as a line on which past tense, present tense and future tense are positioned. Some languages have all three tenses, some have only two, and some have no tenses at all. English and Japanese for example have only two tenses: past and present. Chinese and Indonesian verbs do not show tense. Instead they use other words in the sentence to show when the verb happens. Aspect usually shows us things like whether the action is finished or not, or if something happens regularly. English has two aspects: progressive and perfect. In English, aspect is usually shown by using participle verb forms. Aspect can combine with present or past tense. English uses the gerund-participle, usually together with the auxiliary be (and its forms am, is, are, was, and were) to show the progressive aspect. Many other languages, such as French, do not use progressive tenses. The past perfect can be used to express an unrealized hope, wish, etc. After If, wish and would rather, the past perfect can be used to talk about past events that never happened. Finally, English mood is now usually shown by using modal verbs. In the past, English had a full mood system but that has almost completely disappeared. The subjunctive mood now uses the plain form. There is also a form of be that is used in conditionals to show that something is not true (e.g., If I were a bird, I would fly to California.) Certain parts of a sentence naturally come before verbs or after them, but these are not always the same for all verbs. The main sentence parts are: subject, object, complement, and modifier. Almost all English sentences have subjects, but sentences that are orders (called imperatives) usually do not have any subjects. A subject usually comes before a verb, but it can also come after auxiliary verbs. In the following examples, the subject is underlined and the primary verb is in bold. Many verbs can be followed by an object. These verbs are called transitive verbs. In fact, some verbs must have an object (e.g., take), but some verbs never take an object (e.g., sleep). Verbs that do not take an object are called intransitive verbs. Some verbs can even have two objects. They are called ditransitive verbs. In the following examples, the object is underlined and the primary verb is in bold. Some verbs can or must be followed by a complement. These verbs are called linking verbs or copula. In the following examples, the complement is underlined and the verb is in bold. Verbs can be modified by various modifiers, mainly adverbs. Note that verbs generally do not need modifiers; it's usually a choice. In the following examples, the adverb is underlined and the verb is in bold. Verbs also commonly take a variety of other modifiers including prepositions. Sometimes a verb and another word can have the same shape. In these cases you can usually see the difference by looking at various properties of the words. Sometimes a verb and an adjective can have the same shape. Usually this happens with participles. For example, the present participle interesting and the adjective interesting look the same. Verbs are different from adjectives, though, because they cannot be modified by very, more, or most. For example, you can say ""That is very interesting,"" so you know interesting is an adjective here. But you cannot say ""My teacher is very interesting me in math"" because in this sentence interesting is a verb. On the other hand, if you cannot change the 'be' verb to 'seem' or 'become', it is probably a verb. The gerund-particle sometimes looks like a noun. This is especially true when it is used as a subject, as in the following example: The main differences between these verbs and nouns are: modifiers, number, and objectcomplement Verbs cannot generally be modified by adjectives and nouns cannot generally be modified by adverbs. So, in ""Running regularly is good for you"", running is a verb because it is modified by regularly, an adverb. Verbs cannot change for number, so if you can make the word plural, it is a noun, not a verb. For example, ""this drawing is nice"" can change to ""these drawings are nice"", so drawing is a noun. But ""drawing trees is fun"" cannot change to ""drawings trees is fun"", so it is a verb here. Many verbs can take objects or complements, but nouns cannot. So, in ""parking the car is hard"", parking is a verb because it takes the object the car. But, if you say, ""there's no parking"", parking may be a noun because it does not have an object. Some verbs have become prepositions. Again, usually these share a shape with participles. Here are some examples: The main difference between verbs and prepositions is that verbs have a subject. Even if the subject is not written, you can understand what it is. Prepositions do not have a subject.",Easy

The website mimics the look of the original website of the concerned user's email, bank or credit card. When users think of it as a real site and provide their own information, that information falls into the hands of fraudsters. Phishing is an example of a fraudulent strategy called social engineering. Legislation to prevent phishing, user training, public awareness, and technical prevention are now being developed.

Abu al-Hajjaj Yusuf ibn Ismail (June 29, 1318 - October 19, 1354), known by the regnal name al-Muayyad billah (""He who is aided by God""), was the seventh Nasrid ruler of the Emirate of Granada on the Iberian Peninsula. The third son of Ismail I, he was Sultan between 1333 and 1354, after his brother Muhammad IV (1325–1333) was assassinated. Coming to the throne at age fifteen, he was initially treated as a minor and given only limited power by his ministers and his grandmother Fatima. In February 1334, his representatives secured a four-year peace treaty with Granada's neighbours Castile and the Marinid Sultanate; which was joined by Aragon in May. After gaining more power, in 1338 or 1340, he expelled the Banu Abi al-Ula family who had masterminded the murder of his brother and been the leaders of the Volunteers of the Faith. After the treaty expired, he allied himself with Abu al-Hasan Ali (1331–1348) of the Marinids against Alfonso XI of Castile (1312–1350). After winning a major naval victory in April 1340, the Marinid-Granadan alliance was decisively defeated on 30 October, in the disastrous Battle of Río Salado. He was then unable to prevent Castile from taking several Granadan castles and towns, including Alcalá de Benzaide, Locubín, Priego, and Benamejí. In 1342-1344, Alfonso XI besieged the strategic port of Algeciras. Yusuf led his troops in diversionary raids in Castilian territories, and later engaged the besieging army, but the city fell in March 1344, followed by a ten-year peace treaty with Castile. Alfonso XI broke the treaty and invaded again in 1349, besieging Gibraltar. Ismail was responsible for supplying the besieged port, and led counter-attacks into Castile. The siege was lifted when Alfonso XI died of the Black Death in March 1350. Out of respect, Yusuf ordered his commanders to not attack the Castilian army as they retreated from Granadan territories carrying their King's body. Yusuf signed a treaty with Alfonso's son and successor Peter I (1350–1366). Afterwards, he reluctantly sent his troops to suppress a domestic rebellion against the Castilian king, as required by the treaty. His relation with the Marinids deteriorated when he provided refuge for the rebellious brothers of Sultan Abu Inan Faris (1348–1358). He was assassinated by a madman while praying in the Great Mosque of Granada, on the day of Eid al-Fitr, 19 October 1354. In contrast to the military and territorial losses suffered during his reign, the emirate flourished in the fields of literature, architecture, medicine, and the law. Among other new buildings, he constructed the Madrasa Yusufiyya inside the city of Granada, as well as the Tower of Justice and various additions to the Comares Palace of the Alhambra. Major cultural figures served in his court, including the Abu Nu'aym Ridwan, the poet Ibn al-Jayyab and the polymath Ibn al-Khatib, who consecutively became his vizier. Modern historians consider his reign and that of his son Muhammad V (1354 – 1359 and 1362 – 1391) as the golden era of the Emirate. Abu al-Hajjaj Yusuf ibn Ismail was born on 29 June 1318 (28 Rabi al-Thani 718 AH) in the Alhambra, the fortified royal palace complex of the Nasrid dynasty of the Emirate of Granada. He was the third son of the reigning Sultan Ismail I and a younger brother of the future Muhammad IV. Ismail had four sons and two daughters, but Yusuf was the only child of his mother, Bahar, an umm walad (concubine). When Ismail was assassinated in 1325, he was succeeded by the ten-year old Muhammad, who ruled until he too was assassinated in 25 August 1333, when he was en route back to Granada after the victory at the siege of Gibraltar. The (chamberlain) Abu Nu'aym Ridwan, who was present at the assassination, rode quickly to the capital, arriving on the same day, and after consultation with Fatima bint al-Ahmar (the mother of Ismail, and grandmother of Muhammad and Yusuf) arranged for the declaration of Yusuf as the new sultan. The proclamation took place the next day, 26 August (14 Dhu al-Hijja 733 AH). The Nasrid dynasty of Granada had no specific rule of succession, and there was no mention of why Yusuf was chosen over Ismail's second son Faraj, who was a one year older. Yusuf's later vizier, the historian Ibn al-Khatib, described the young Yusuf as ""white-skinned, naturally strong, had a fine figure and an even finer character"", with large eyes, dark straight hair, and a thick beard. He further wrote that Yusuf liked to ""dress with elegance"", was interested in art, architecture, a ""collector of arms"", and ""had some mechanical ability"". Coming to the throne at the age of fifteen, Yusuf was initially treated as a minor and according to Ibn al-Khatib, his authority was limited to only ""choosing the food to eat from his table"". His grandmother, Fatima, and the Ridwan became his tutors and exercised some powers of government, together with other ministers. Upon his accession he took the laqab (honorific or regnal name) al-Mu'ayyad billah (""He who is aided by God""). The founder of the dynasty, Muhammad I, had taken a laqab (al-Ghalib billah, ""Victor by the grace of God"") but not subsequent sultans. After Yusuf this was done by almost all sultans. According to the Christian chronicles, Yusuf immediately requested the protection of Abu al-Hasan Ali of the Marinid Sultanate, his late brother's ally. The emirate was the last Muslim state on the Iberian Peninsula, founded by Muhammad I in the 1230s. Through a combination of diplomatic and military manoeuvres, the emirate succeeded in maintaining its independence, despite being located between two larger neighbours: the Christian Crown of Castile to the north and the Muslim Marinid Sultanate in Morocco. Granada intermittently entered into alliance or went to war with both of these powers, or encouraged them to fight one another, in order to avoid being dominated by either. From time to time, the sultans of Granada swore fealty and paid tribute to the kings of Castile, an important source of income for Castile. From Castile's point of view, Granada was a royal vassal, while Muslim sources never described the relationship as such, and Muhammad I, for instance, on occasions declared his fealty to other Muslim sovereigns. Yusuf's predecessor, Muhammad IV, sought help from the Marinid Sultanate to counter a threat by an alliance of Castile and the powerful commander Uthman ibn Abi al-Ula, who supported a pretender to the throne in a civil war. He had to yield Ronda, Marbella, and Algeciras in exchange for a military alliance. Subsequently the Marinid-Granadan forces captured Gibraltar and fended off a Castilian attempt to retake it, before signing a peace treaty with Alfonso XI of Castile and Abu al-Hasan the day before his assassination. While the actual killing of Muhammad IV was carried out by a slave named Zayyan, it was a politically motivated plot by Abu Thabit ibn Uthman and Ibrahim ibn Uthman, prominent members of the Banu Abi al-Ula family and leaders of the North African Volunteers of the Faith, the corps of North Africans fighting in the Iberian Peninsula on behalf of Granada. According to Ibn Khaldun, they decided to kill Yusuf due to his closeness to the Marinid Sultan Abu al-Hasan—their political enemy—while according to Castilian chronicles it was because of the friendly way he treated Alfonso XI at the conclusion of the siege. As a result of Muhammad's cessions to the Marinids and the taking of Gibraltar, at Yusuf's accession the Marinids had sizable garrisons and territories on traditionally Granadan lands in Al-Andalus (the Muslim-controlled part of the Iberian peninsula). The peace that Muhammad IV secured after the siege of Gibraltar was, by the principles of the time, rendered void by his death, and representatives of Yusuf met with those of Alfonso XI and Abu al-Hasan Ali. They signed a treaty at Fez, in Morocco, on 26 February 1334 with a four year duration. Like previous treaties, it authorised free trade between the three kingdoms, but unusually, it did not include payments of tribute from Granada to Castile. Marinid ships were to be given access to Castilian ports, and the Marinid Sultan Abu al-Hasan promised not to increase his garrisons on the Iberian peninsula—but he could still rotate them. The latter condition was favourable not only to Castile but also to Granada, which was wary of possible expansionism by the larger Marinid Sultanate into the peninsula. Additionally, Alfonso IV of Aragon agreed to join the treaty in May 1334, and signed his own agreement with Yusuf on 3 June 1335. After Alfonso IV's death in January 1336, his son Peter IV renewed the bilateral Granadan-Aragonese treaty for five years, ushering in a period of peace between Granada and all its neighbours. With the treaty in place, the monarchs redirected their attentions elsewhere: Alfonso XI cracked down on his rebellions nobles, while Abu al-Hasan waged war against the Zayyanid Kingdom of Tlemcen in North Africa. During these years, Yusuf acted against the Banu Abi al-Ula family, the masterminds of Muhammad IV's assassination. In September 1340 (or 1338), Abu Thabit ibn Uthman was removed from his post as the overall Chief of the Volunteers and replaced by Yahya ibn Umar of the Banu Rahhu family. Abu Thabit was expelled along with his three brothers and the entire family to the Hafsid Kingdom of Tunis. Historian L. P. Harvey comments that ""y the standards of acts of revenge in those days... this was quite restrained"", probably because Yusuf did not want to unnecessarily create tensions with the North African volunteers. In the spring of 1339, after the expiration of the treaty, hostilities recommenced with Marinid raids into the Castilian countryside. Confrontations ensued between Castile on one side and the two Muslim kingdoms on the other. Granada was invaded by Castilian troops led by Gonzalo Martínez, Master of the Order of Alcántara, who raided Locubín, Alcalá de Benzaide and Priego. In turn, Yusuf led an army of 8,000 in besieging Siles, but was forced to lift the siege by the forces of the Master of the Order of Santiago, Alfonso Méndez de Guzmán. The personal rivalry between Martínez and Guzman appears to have caused the former to defect to Yusuf, but he was soon captured by Castillian forces, hung as a traitor and his body burned. The Marinid commander on the peninsula, Abu Malik Abd al-Wahid, son of Abu al-Hasan, died during a battle with Castile on 20 October 1339, but Marinid forces continued to ravage the Castilian frontiers until they were defeated in Jerez. In autumn 1339, the Aragonese fleet under Jofre Gillabert tried to land near Algeciras but was driven away after their admiral was killed. On 8 April 1340, a major battle took place off Algeciras between the Castilian fleet under Alfonso Jofré Tenorio and a larger Marinid-Granadan fleet under Muhammad al-Azafi, resulting in a Muslim victory and the death of Tenorio. The Muslim fleet captured 28 galleys out of the 44 in the Castilian fleet, and 7 carracks. Abu al-Hasan saw the naval victory as a harbinger for the conquest of Castile. He crossed the Strait of Gibraltar with his army, including siege engines, his wives, and his entire court. He landed in Algeciras on 4 August, was joined by Yusuf, and laid siege on Tarifa, a port on the Strait, on 23 September. Alfonso XI marched to relieve Tarifa, joined by Portuguese troops led by his ally, King Afonso IV of Portugal. They arrived five miles from Tarifa on 29 October, and Yusuf and Abu al-Hasan moved to meet them. Alfonso XI commanded 8,000 horsemen, 12,000 foot soldiers and an unknown number of urban militia, while Afonso IV had 1,000 men. The Muslim strength is unclear: contemporary Christian sources claimed an exaggerated 53,000 horsemen and 600,000 foot soldiers; while modern historian Ambrosio Huici Miranda in 1956 estimated 7,000 Granadan troops and 60,000 Moroccans. Crucially, the Christian knights had much better armor than the more lightly equipped Muslim cavalry. The resulting Battle of Río Salado, on 30 October 1340, was a decisive Christian victory. Yusuf, who wore a golden helmet in the battle, fled the field after a charge by the Portuguese troops. The Granadan contingent initially defended itself and was about to defeat Afonso IV in a counter attack, but was routed when Christian reinforcements arrived, leaving their Marinids allies behind. The Marinids too were routed in the main battle, which lasted from 9 a.m. to noon. Harvey opined that the key to the Christian victory—despite their numeric disadvantage—was their cavalry tactics and superior armor. Muslim tactics—which focused on lightly armored, highly mobile cavalry—were well suited for open battle, but in the relatively narrow battlefield of Río Salado the Christian formation of armored knights attacking in a well-formed battle line had a decisive advantage. In the aftermath of the battle, the Christian troops pillaged the Muslim camp and massacred the women and children, including Abu al-Hasan's Queen Fatima, the daughter of King Abu Bakr II of Tunis—to the dismay of their commanders who would have preferred to see her ransomed. Numerous royal persons and nobles were captured, including Abu al-Hasan's son, Abu Umar Tashufin. Yusuf retreated to Granada through Marbella. Abu al-Hasan marched to Gibraltar, sent news of victory back home to prevent any rebellion in his absence, and crossed the Strait to Ceuta the same night. Various Muslim authors laid the blame on the Marinid Sultan, with Umar II of Tlemcen saying that he ""humiliated the head of Islam and filled the idolaters with joy"", and Al-Maqqari commenting that he allowed his army to be ""scattered like dust before the wind"". Yusuf appeared to not have been blamed, and continued to be popular in Granada. Alfonso XI returned victoriously to Seville and paraded the Muslim captives and the booty taken by his army. There was so much gold and silver that their prices as far away as Paris and Avignon fell by one sixth. With the bulk of the Marinids retreating to North Africa, Alfonso XI was able to act freely against Granada. He invaded the emirate in April 1341, feigning a plan to attack Málaga. When Yusuf reinforced this western port—taking many men from elsewhere—Alfonso redirected his troops towards Alcalá de Benzaide, a major border fortress thirty miles north of Granada, whose garrison had been reduced in order to reinforce Málaga. The Castilian army started a siege and ravaged the surrounding countryside, not only taking food but also destroying vines—causing lasting damage to the local agriculture without any benefit to the attackers. In response, Yusuf moved to a strong position in Pinos Puente to block Castilian attempts to raid further into the rich plains surrounding the city of Granada. Alfonso XI extended the raids into more areas in order to tempt Yusuf to leave his position, but the Granadan army held its ground as the Castilians devastated the area surrounding Locubín and Illora. As the siege progressed, Yusuf received Marinid reinforcements from Algeciras and moved ten kilometers (six miles) to Moclín. Neither side was willing to risk a frontal attack and Alfonso unsuccessfully tried to provoke Yusuf into an ambush. With relief unlikely, the Muslim defenders of Alcalá offered to surrender the fortress in exchange for safe conduct, to which Alfonso agreed; the capitulation took place on 20 August 1341. Yusuf then offered a truce, but Alfonso demanded that he break his alliance with the Marinids, which Yusuf refused to do, and the war continued. Concurrently with the siege of Alcalá, Alfonso's troops also captured the nearby Locubín. In the following weeks after the fall of Alcalá's, the Castilians captured Priego, Carcabuey, Matrera, and Benamejí. In May 1342, a Marinid-Granadan fleet sailing in the Strait of Gibraltar was ambushed by Castilian and Genoese ships, resulting in a Christian victory and the destruction of twelve galleys and the dispersal of other vessels along the Granadan coast. Alfonso XI then targeted Algeciras, an important port on the Strait of Gibraltar which his father Ferdinand IV had failed to take in 1309–10. Alfonso arrived in early August 1342 and slowly imposed a land and sea blockade on the city. Yusuf's army took to the field, joined by Marinid troops from Ronda, trying to threaten the besiegers from the rear or divert their attention. Between November 1342 and February 1343, it raided the lands around Écija, entered and sacked Palma del Río, retook Benamejí and captured Estepa. In June, he sent his , Ridwan, to Alfonso offering payments in exchange for the lifting of the siege. Alfonso countered the offer by increasing the payment he would require. Yusuf sailed to North Africa to consult with Abu al-Hasan and raise the money, but the payment from the Marinid Sultan was not enough. Despite the safe conduct given by Alfonso, Yusuf's galley was attacked by a Genoese ship in Alfonso's service, which tried to steal the gold. Yusuf's ships repulsed the attack; Alfonso apologised but did not take any action against the Genoese ship's captain. The Muslim defenders of Algeciras made use of cannons, one of the earliest recorded uses of this weapon in a major European confrontation—before of the better-known Battle of Crécy in 1346. Alfonso's forces were augmented by crusading contingents from all over Europe, including from both France and England, which were at war. Among European nobles present were King Philip III of Navarre, Gaston, Count of Foix, the Earl of Salisbury and the Earl of Derby. On 12 December 1343, Yusuf crossed the Palmones River and engaged a Castilian detachment. This was reported in Castilian sources as a Muslim defeat. Early in 1344, Alfonso constructed a floating barrier made of trees chained together, that stopped supplies from reaching Algeciras. With the hope of victory fading and the city on the verge of starvation, Yusuf began negotiations again. He sent an envoy, named Hasan Algarrafa in Castilian chronicles, and offered the surrender of Algeciras if its inhabitants were allowed to leave with their movable property, in exchange for a fifteen-year peace between Granada, Castile, and the Marinids. Despite being counselled to reject the offer, and instead to take Algeciras by storm and massacre its inhabitants, Alfonso was aware of the uncertain outcome of an assault when hostile forces were nearby. He agreed to Algarrafa's proposal, but requested that the truce be limited to ten years, which Yusuf accepted. Other than Yusuf and Alfonso, the treaty included Abu al-Hasan, Peter IV, and the Doge of Genoa. Yusuf and Alfonso signed the treaty on 25 March 1344 in the Castilian camp outside Algeciras. War broke out again in Granada in 1349 when Alfonso declared that the peace treaty no longer prevented him from attacking Muslim territories because the Marinid Iberian territories were now controlled by Abu Inan Faris, Abu al-Hasan's son, who had rebelled and seized Fez the year before. In June or July 1349, his forces began the siege of Gibraltar, a port which had been captured by Ferdinand IV in 1309 before falling to the Marinids in 1333. Prior to the siege, Yusuf sent archers and foot soldiers to reinforce the town's garrison. In July, Alfonso was personally present among the besiegers, and in the same month he ordered his Kingdom of Murcia to attack Yusuf's Granada. Despite Yusuf's protests, Peter IV sent an Aragonese fleet to assist the siege, even though in order to respect the peace treaty with Yusuf he instructed his men not to harm any subject of Granada. With the Marinids unable to send help, the main responsibility for fighting Castile fell to Yusuf. He led his troops in a series of counter-attacks. During the summer of 1349 he raided the outskirts of Alcaraz and Quesada, and besieged Écija. In the winter he sent Ridwan to besiege Cañete la Real, which surrendered after two days. As the siege progressed, the Black Death (known in Spain as the mortandad grande), which had entered Iberian ports in 1348, struck the besiegers camp. Alfonso persisted in the siege despite the urgings of his counselors. He became infected himself and died on Good Friday 1350 (26 March), or the day before. The Castilian forces withdrew from Gibraltar, with some of the defenders coming out to watch. Out of respect, Yusuf ordered his army and his commanders in the border regions not to attack the Castilian procession as it traveled with the King's body to Seville. Alfonso was succeeded by his fifteen year-old son, Peter I. Yusuf, Peter, and Abu Inan of the Marinids concluded a treaty in 17 July 1350, which was to last until 1 January 1357. Trade was reopened between Granada and Castile (except for horses, arms, and wheat), and captives were exchanged. In exchange for peace, Yusuf paid tribute to Peter and agreed to provide 300 light horsemen when requested, but Yusuf did not formally become Peter's vassal. Despite privately disliking Peter, Yusuf observed his treaty obligations: he reluctantly sent 300 jinete cavalry to help the Castilian king suppress the rebellion of Alfonso Fernández Coronel in Aguilar, and refused to help the King's half-brother, Henry, when he attempted to start a rebellion against Peter from Algeciras. Abu al-Hasan tried unsuccessfully to regain the Marinid throne until his death in 1351. Two other challengers to Abu Inan, his brothers Abu al-Fadl and Abu Salim, fled to Granada. Yusuf refused pressure from the Marinid Sultan to hand them over. Like many other Nasrid sultans, Yusuf found that the presence of Marinid pretenders in his court gave him leverage in case the two states came into conflict. At Yusuf's encouragement, Abu al-Fadl then went to Castile to seek help from Peter. Peter, seeking to incite another civil war in North Africa, provided ships to land the prince in Sus in order to attack Abu Inan. The Marinid Sultan was extremely angered by Yusuf's actions but felt unable to take action, knowing that he was supported by Castile. Abu al-Fadl was subsequently captured by Abu Inan and executed in 1354 or 1355. Abu Salim eventually became sultan in 1359–1361, well after Yusuf's death. Yusuf constructed the Bab al-Sharia (now the Tower of Justice) in the Alhambra in 1348, forming the grand entrance to the complex. He also built what is now the Broken Tower (Torre Quebrada) of the Citadel of the Alhambra, and the Tower of the Captive on the ramparts. He also carried out work in the Comares Palace, including renovations of the its hammam (bathhouse), as well as the construction of the Hall of the Comares, also known as the Chamber of the Ambassadors, the largest Nasrid structure in the complex. He built various new walls and towers to accommodate his enlargement of the Comares, and adorned many of the courts and halls of the Alhambra, as may be seen from the repeated appearance of his name in the inscriptions on the walls. In 1349, he founded a religious school, Madrasa Yusufiyya, near the Great Mosque of Granada (now Granada Cathedral). Only its prayer room remains today. Outside Granada, he enlarged the Alcazaba of Málaga, the ancestral home of his paternal grandfather, Abu Said Faraj, the former governor of Málaga, as well as the city's Gibralfaro precinct. Yusuf also constructed new defensive structures throughout his realm, including new towers, gates, and barbicans, especially after the defeat of Río Salado. He reinforced existing castles, walls, as well as coastal defences. The Ridwan built forty watchtowers (tali'a), stretching the entire length of the Emirate's southern coast. Yusuf reinforced the city walls of Granada, as well as the Bab Ilbira (now the Gate of Elvira) and the Bab al-Ramla (the Gate of the Ears). Yusuf's administration was supported by numerous ministers, including ""a constellation of major cultural figures"", according to the modern scholar Antonio Fernández-Puertas. Among them was Ridwan, who held the post of (chamberlain), a title created for the first time in the Nasrid rule for him by Muhammad IV and outranked that of the vizier and other ministers. The had command of the army in the absence of the sultan. He was dismissed and imprisoned after the defeat at Río Salado; he was freed a year later but then refused Yusuf's offer to reappoint him, as vizier. The next, Abu al-Hasan ibn al-Mawl, came from a prominent family but proved unskilled in political matters. He was dismissed after a few months and fled to North Africa to avoid the intrigues of his rivals. The office of remained vacant until Ridwan regained it under Yusuf's successor Muhammad V (first reign, 1354 – 1359); following Ridwan's assassination in 1359, the post again disappeared until the appointment of Abu al-Surrur Mufarrij by Yusuf III (r. 1408–1417). The famous poet Ibn al-Jayyab was appointed as vizier in 1341, becoming the highest-ranked minister and the mastermind of Yusuf's cautious policy after Salado. He was also the royal secretary, therefore he was titled dhu'l-wizaratayn (""the holder of the two vizierates""). He died of the Black Death in 1349. In accordance to his wishes, he was succeeded as both vizier and royal secretary by his protégé, Ibn al-Khatib. Ibn al-Khatib had entered the court chancery (diwan al-insha) in 1340, replacing his father who died at Salado and serving under Ibn al-Jayyab. After becoming vizier he was also appointed to other posts, such as superintendent of the finances. With access to official documents and the court archives, Ibn al-Khatib produced numerous works; he remains one of the main historical sources on the Emirate of Granada. Yusuf received his subjects publicly twice each week, on Monday and Thursday, to listen to their concerns, assisted by his ministers and members of the royal family. According to Shihab al-Din al-'Umari, these hearings included the recitation of a tenth of the Quran and some parts of the hadith. On solemn state occasions, Yusuf presided over court activities from a wooden folding armchair that is currently preserved in the Museum of the Alhambra and bears the Nasrid coat of arms across its back. Between April and May 1347, he made a state visit to his eastern regions, with the main purpose of inspecting the fortifications in this part of his realm. Accompanied by his court, he visited twenty places in twenty-two days, including the port of Almería, where he was well received by the populace. Ibn al-Khatib describes other anecdotes that illustrate Yusuf's popularity, including his reception by a well-respected judge in Purchena, by the people—including common womenfolk—of Guadix in 1354, and by certain Christian merchants in the same year. According to the historian Francisco Vidal Castro, gold coins bearing Yusuf's name had particularly beautiful designs, many of which are still found today (one example is provided in the infobox of this article). In diplomacy, for the first time in Nasrid history he sent and embassy to the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo. A surviving copy of a letter from the Mamluk Sultan al-Salih Salih indicated that Yusuf had requested military help to fight the Christians; al-Salih prayed for Yusuf's victory but declined to send troops, saying they were needed for conflicts in his own borders. Many of Yusuf's diplomatic exchanges with the rulers of North Africa—especially the Marinid Sultans—are preserved in Rayhanat al-Kuttab compiled by Ibn al-Khatib. In the judiciary, the chief judge (qadi al-jama'a) Abu Abdullah Muhammad al-Ash'ari al-Malaqi who was appointed by Muhammad IV continued to serve under Yusuf until his death on the battle of Río Salado. He was known for his strong opinion; in one occasion, he wrote a poem to Yusuf warning him of officials who squandered tax revenues, and in another, he reminded the Sultan of his responsibilities to his subjects as a Muslim leader. After the death al-Malaqi, Yusuf appointed, consecutively, Muhammad ibn Ayyash, Ibn Burtal, Abu al-Qasim Muhammad al-Sabti. The latter resigned during his tenure in 1347 and Yusuf then appointed Abu al-Barakat ibn al-Hajj al-Balafiqi, who previously served as judges in various provinces and was known for his love of literature. Yusuf strengthened the function of the muftis, distinguished jurists who issued legal opinions (fatwas), often to assist judges in interpreting difficult points of the Islamic law. The Madrasa Yusufiyya, where Maliki Islamic law was among the subjects taught, was created partly to increase the influence of the muftis. Yusuf's emphasis of the rule of law and appointment of distinguished judges improved his standing among his subjects and among other Muslim monarchies. Two of Yusuf's concubines bore him children. His concubine Buthayna gave birth to Muhammad (later Muhammad V) when Yusuf was twenty, and to a daughter named Aisha. Another concubine, Maryam, bore him seven children: two sons—Ismail (later Ismail II), who was born nine months after Muhammad, and Qays—as well as five daughters—Fatima, Mu'mina, Khadija, Shams and Zaynab. The eldest daughter married her cousin, who would reign as Muhammad VI. Maryam's influence was said to be greater than that of Butayna, and Yusuf favored his second son Ismail above his other children. Initially, Yusuf designated Ismail as his heir, but later—a few days before his death—he named Muhammad instead. The education of the children was entrusted to Abu Nu'aym Ridwan, the who was a former Christian and managed to teach the young Ismail some Greek. Yusuf's grandmother Fatima, who had been influential in the Granadan court for multiple generations, died in 1349 aged 90 lunar years, and received an elegy from Ibn al-Khatib. The activity of Yusuf's mother Bahar was also attested: when the North African traveller Ibn Battuta visited Granada in 1350 and sought a royal audience, Yusuf was sick and in his place Bahar provided Ibn Battuta with enough money for his stay, even though it was unknown if Bahar actually met him or if he was received inside the Alhambra. Yusuf's concubine Maryam played an important role after his death: In 1359, she financed a coup that involved 100 men and deposed her stepson Muhammad V in favor of her son Ismail. Yusuf was assassinated whilst praying in Granada's Great Mosque on 19 October 1354 (Eid al-Fitr1 Shawwal 755 AH). A maniac stabbed him with a dagger during the last prostration of the prayer ritual. He was carried to his royal apartment in the Alhambra, where he died. The motivation for this attack remains unknown. The assassin was interrogated, but his words were unintelligible. He was soon killed by a mob. His body was burnt (according to Ibn al-Khatib, though this statement might have referred to his supposed burning in hellfire) or ""cut into a thousand pieces"" (according to Ibn Khaldun). Yusuf was succeeded by his eldest son, who became Muhammad V. Yusuf was buried in the royal cemetery (rawda) of the Alhambra, alongside his great-grandfather, Muhammad II, and his father, Ismail I. Centuries later, with the surrender of Granada, the last sultan, Muhammad XII (also known as Boabdil), exhumed the bodies in this cemetery and reburied them in Mondújar, part of his Alpujarras estates. Fernández-Puertas describes the reigns of Yusuf and his successor Muhammad V as the ""climax"" of the Nasrid period, as seen from the realm's architectural and cultural output, and the flourishing of the study of medicine. Similarly, the historian Brian A. Catlos describes the reigns of the two Sultans as the emirate's ""era of greatest glory"", and Rachel Arié describes the same period as its ""apogee"". L. P. Harvey describes Yusaf's cultural achievements as ""considerable"" and ""solid"", and as marking the beginning of the dynasty's ""Golden Age"". Furthermore, Yusuf's Granada survived the ""onslaught of Alfonso XI's attacks"" and at the end reduced its dependency on the Marinids. However, Harvey notes that he was defeated at Río Salado, ""the greatest single reverse suffered by the Muslim cause"" during the Nasrid period before the fall of Granada, and presided over the strategically significant losses of Algeciras and Alcalá de Benzaide.",Easy

Mondrian enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Amsterdam in 1892. He was 22 years old. Mondrian studied there from 1892-1895. He painted realistic paintings which were mostly landscapes of Holland early in his career. Later Mondrian simplified his paintings. He simplified by using shapes and colors. He became interested in the theosophical doctrine in 1892. Mondrian discovered Cubism during a stay in Paris from 1911 to 1914. He gradually abandoned references to realism, retaining only the basic structures of forms. He no longer painted as horizontal and vertical lines that form parallel and perpendicular lines. There are more than the three primary colors used as well as white and black. His work then became a grid of black lines defining squares and rectangles of various sizes, forming spaces of pure colors. After revenue declined in the Netherlands during World War II, Mondrian returned to Paris where he lived from 1919 to 1938. He moved to New York in 1940.

"Roman houses, (domus in latin) were of several types depending on their location in the city or countryside and on the inhabitants they were designed for. They were at least three different types. Even emperors's palace were called domus. Ordinary people lived in apartment blocks called Insulae, a kind of apartment building. It housed most people of lower- or middle-class status (the plebs) and all but the wealthiest from the upper-middle class (the equites). Insulae were of poor quality, but they did have running water and sanitation. Rooms could be owned or rented. They were built in timber, mud brick, and later primitive concrete. They were restricted in height to about 20 metres. An insula dating from the early 2nd century A.D. ...in the Roman port town of Ostia. A schematic of an insula. Houses of the rich and upper classes were lavish. The atrium was the most important part of the house. It was where guests were greeted. The atrium was open in the centre, surrounded at least in part by high-ceilinged porticoes that often contained only sparse furnishings to give the effect of a large space. In the centre was a square roof opening in which rainwater could come, draining inwards from the slanted tiled roof. The master's office was placed so that the master could see what was going on. There were kitchens, bedrooms, a dining room, and a number of open rooms. Servants would use a servants' entrance, not the main entrance. Slaves could not leave the house without the permission of the master. The domus was not just a house; it was a place of business as well. A slave eating room of a reconstructed domus. Kitchen.

The villa urbana, was a country seat in easy reach of Rome (or another city). The villa rustica was a farm-house estate, like the later English country house. It was occupied by servants who ran the estate. In the Empire, there was a concentration of Imperial villas near the Bay of Naples, on the Isle of Capri, at Monte Circeo on the coast and at Antium (Anzio). Wealthy Romans escaped the summer heat in the hills round Rome, especially around Frascati (such as Hadrian's Villa). Cicero had at least seven villas. The oldest of these was near Arpinum, which he inherited. Pliny the Younger had three or four, of which the example near Laurentium is the best known from his descriptions. Some sumptuous Roman villas featured complex floor mosaics, such as Villa Armira in modern Bulgaria. Late Roman owners of villas had luxuries like hypocaust-heated rooms with mosaics. Large villas were important to the Roman economy. They dominated the Po valley, Campania, and Sicily, and were also found in Gaul. Villas were centres of mining, pottery, or horse raising. Villas specializing in shipping olive oil to Roman legions in Germany were a feature of the southern Iberian province of Hispania Baetica.

"Star Frankenstein (1818 novel) isn't the only star article → Find more of them! Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus is a horror novel by Mary Shelley. It was published in Londonin 1818. The novel was her contribution to a horror story competition among her friends, Percy Bysshe Shelley (her future husband), Lord Byron, and John Polidori, Percy's doctor. Frankenstein is about a hideous monster created from dead body parts. The tale is often considered the first science fiction novel, and has had considerable impact on western culture. It has been adapted to stage plays and movies many times. The novel tells the story of Dr. Victor Frankenstein and a monster he creates from dead body parts. He brings the monster to life using the power of a tremendous electrical storm. The monster causes a number of unforeseen disasters and kills a number of people. The doctor creates but destroys a female monster intended as a mate for the original. The monster rages and flees to the Arctic on a dog sled pursued by the doctor. Doctor Frankenstein dies aboard a rescue ship, but the monster disappears into the Arctic seas on a raft, never to be seen again. Shelley began writing Frankenstein when she was 18 years old, and completed it at the age of 20. In 1814, before the novel was begun, she traveled through Europe. In Germany, she visited Castle Frankenstein near Darmstadt with her future husband Percy Bysshe Shelley. At one time in this castle, experiments were conducted on living humans. She later suppressed any mention of this visit in order to claim complete originality for her novel. She may even have based the fictional Dr. Victor Frankenstein on Percy Shelley. His pen name was Victor and at one time he had conducted experiments with magnetism, gunpowder, and other substances in his rooms at Oxford University. These rooms were cluttered with all sorts of scientific equipments. In Switzerland, occult practices were topics of conversation among her traveling companions. Mary, Percy Shelley, Lord Byron, and John Polidori, a doctor, agreed to compete among themselves in writing horror stories during a long rainy summer. Mary pondered over her story line until a dream of a scientist inspired her. The result was Frankenstein. The novel was published anonymously in London by a small publishing house in three volumes in 1818. The story has been adapted to movies and other media several times. The first adaptation was Henry M. Milner's The Man and The Monster; or The Fate of Frankenstein. This drama was staged in London in 1826. In 1910, the first Frankenstein movie was released by the Edison Studios. It was 16-minutes long, silent, black and white, and starred Augustus Phillips as the doctor, Mary Fuller as the doctor's betrothed, and Charles Stanton Ogle as the monster. In 1915, another silent movie was released called Life Without a Soul. This movie is lost, and not much is known about it. In 1931, the first full-length movie was released called Frankenstein. This black and white ""talkie"" starred Boris Karloff as the monster, and Colin Clive as the doctor. It was directed by James Whale, who also directed the 1935 sequel, Bride of Frankenstein. Some of the original cast returned for the sequel with Elsa Lanchester joining them as the Bride. In the following decades the monster and the theme of the novel were exploited in a cornucopia of B movies such as Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, House of Frankenstein, House of Dracula, and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. Hammer Films of England also released several horror pics between 1957 and 1974 based on the characters and themes. These pics include The Curse of Frankenstein, The Revenge of Frankenstein, and Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed. Horror movie notable, Christopher Lee, starred in many of them. Pop artist Andy Warhol tried his hand at the tale in 1973 with the movie, Andy Warhol's Frankenstein. In 1994, Kenneth Branagh released Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, a distinguished movie starring Helena Bonham Carter, Tom Hulce, and Robert De Niro as the monster. There have been countless adaptations and parodies over the years including the comedy movie, Young Frankenstein (1974) from Mel Brooks, and The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975).

"The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is one of the most famous telescopes. It is the first optical space observatory telescope. Being above the atmosphere means it can see the sky more clearly than a telescope on the ground, because the atmosphere blurs starlight before it reaches earth. Named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble, the Hubble Space Telescope can observe 24 hours a day. The main mirror is 2.4 meters across. The telescope can take pictures of things so far away it would be nearly impossible to see them from anywhere else. It actually observes less than 20% of the time. It was made by both NASA and the ESA working together. It is 600km in space and was launched April 24 1990. It completes a full orbit of Earth every 97 minutes. That means it travels at 5 miles (10 km) per second. If you were going this speed on Earth, you would be able to get from New York to San Francisco in 10 minutes. The Hubble itself is the size of a large school bus, but still small enough to fit inside the cargo bay of a Space Shuttle. It was repaired in 1993 due to problems in the picture quality. The telescope was launched in 1990 by a space shuttle. When it entered orbit, everything seemed fine. But there was a problem with the telescope that was not discovered until it started taking pictures. When the HST took its first pictures, astronomers were happy to see the images, but they were not as sharp and as crisp as expected. Telescopes in space can take better pictures than telescopes on Earth, but for some reason the pictures were not better than the pictures taken on Earth. They found a problem with the telescope's mirror. The mirror was not curved right, but only by 2.2 micrometres (150th as thick as a piece of paper). Still, this was enough to cause the images to be blurred. Some said that Hubble was nearsighted. Another space shuttle was soon sent up to repair the space telescope. The repair was not easy. The astronauts had to install some small mirrors to correct the light from the big mirror. The big mirror could still be used. It took five days of space walks. When astronaut Story Musgrave opened one of the doors on Hubble to install a new camera, the door would not close, so Musgrave and the other astronauts had to think of a creative way to get around the problem. Eventually, Hubble was fixed. Repairs and servicing missions have been made to the Hubble Space Telescope five times to keep it in orbit and make it even better as technology improved. The space shuttle program was kept going longer than planned to send an extra trip up to the Hubble Space Telescope for a final fix. Hubble will soon be replaced by the James Webb Space Telescope which will fly even higher above the Earth. There are now other telescopes in orbit, like the Herschel Space Observatory and the Kepler Spacecraft, which was specially made for finding Earth-like planets around other stars.",Easy
"A Indian peafowl is a bird of the Phasianidae family. It is a relative of the pheasant. It originally lives in Pakistan and India. It is a domestic fowl in many other parts of the world, and sometime a feral animal. The male Peafowl can have up to 150 brightly coloured feathers on its tail coverts. For centuries peafowls have been admired for their beauty and hunted for their meat. Recently peacocks have become more popular in parks and gardens. The male peafowls (called peacocks) have long, colourful feathers. Female peafowls (called peahens) have shorter, brown feathers. They like to eat any kind of green shoots (flowers, veggies, grass etc.) as well as wheat, cracked corn or wild game feed. They can handle freezing temperatures as long as they have a dry perch that is out of the wind and weather. Dry dog and cat chows make excellent winter feed for peafowl, who are omnivores, eating insects, small snakes, lizards, grain, as well as many varieties of greens. They are particularly fond of petunias and similar pot plants, leaving nothing but a small green circle where the stem once emerged from the soil. The birds will learn to come to a specific place at specific times of day to be fed, and a regular light feeding during summer adapts them to coming to the feeding place in winter. The peafowl is native to southeast Asia including India, but they were brought to Europe long ago. They can acclimatize to colder areas. The very long, elegant and colorful plumage of the male birds, peacocks, is grown over the winter months so that they are ready for the early spring mating season, during which each male establishes a territory and calls the females to come admire his dance, a rustling of tail quills which hold up the fanned back plumes (= tail feathers) as he stamps and turns. The summoning call is loud, repeated, happens sometimes at night, and sounds, to some people, like a woman screaming. Often it is tri-syllabic, mi-fa-sol. Once the mating season is over, the tail feathers are naturally shed. The peacock's display is a classic example of sexual selection. The female birds, peahens, are soft brown and gray with white chests and bellies and some light green on the neck, the colors blending so well with weeds and grasses that when the female is nesting on the ground, she is almost invisible. The hen teaches her chicks what to eat by putting her beak down at a chosen bug, grain, seed, or leaf and making a throaty ""grock"" sound. The chick put its beak against the mother's, follows the beak to the tip, and eats whatever it points at. The chicks can learn what to eat from a hen of another species, but, unlike baby chickens, peachicks need to be shown what to eat. Chicks hatched in a hatchery can starve to death if there is no hen to teach them what to eat. In addition to the ""eat this"" sound, the female has a particular call for a missing chick, a ""where are you,"" ""hoo-hah"" call, two toned, high then low, mi-do, mi-do. When a chick is missing, this call can go on for hours. She lays from two to six eggs in the spring time and, once all are laid, sits on the eggs for about thirty days to hatch them, leaving the nest once or twice a day to feed and drink. Often the female will utter a shrieked ""trouble"" call, a quickly repeated ""cuk, cuk, cuk, cuk"" when she leaves the nest, to attract predators away from it. Once the chicks are hatched, the mother leads them away from the broken eggs, as the smell of the eggs attracts predators. They are able to flutter a little within hours, and in a few days can fly up into sheltering trees by going first to lower branches and working their way higher, preferring high, protected branches. The chicks roost on either side of the peahen, and she extends her wings to cover them during the night, thus protecting them from rain, hail, and visits from owls. They begin to grow their ""crowns"" when they are only a few weeks old and it takes about a year for them to reach full size, though it may take three years to reach breeding age. Both males and females are hatched with the same plumage; nine to twelve months after hatching, the males' necks begin to turn peacock blue, and their splendid plumage takes about four years to reach full size.",Easy

"A gladiator was an armed combatant who fought other gladiators, condemned criminals, and ferocious animals in the arenas of Ancient Rome for the amusement of the populace. Trajan is said to have celebrated his war victories in the Colosseum with contests involving 11,000 animals and 10,000 gladiators over the course of 123 days. The word gladiator is derived from the Latin word for ""sword"" (gladius), but other weapons were also used in arena such as tridents, daggers, and large nets. Most gladiators were slaves who were trained in gladiatorial schools, and were thus highly prized by their masters. Gladiators were not sacrificed in the arena flippantly because they could make great sums of money for their owners. Nevertheless, they were despised by Roman society, and socially marginalized. The Emperor Commodus dressed himself as Hercules and willingly participated in the arena, much to the bewilderment and annoyance of the Roman people. His cowardly and merciless murders of helpless animals, wounded soldiers, amputees, and cripples scandalized and horrified Romans. He was said to have killed 100 lions in a single day. His brutal and ignoble participation in the arena may have led to his assassination. Gladiatorial combats may have originated during the Punic Wars of the 3rd century BC as funeral rites. The combats were eventually suppressed by early Christian emperors. Modern depictions of the gladiator appear in the movies Spartacus starring Kirk Douglas and Galdiator starring Russell Crowe. Many B movies were made during the mid 20th century in Europe that featured oily bodybuilders as gladiators liberating the downtrodden or defeating evil queens and tyrants.",Easy

"Mary Poppins is a 1964 live-actionanimated musical movie produced by Walt Disney and directed by Robert Stevenson. The movie was filmed entirely in the Disney Studios in Burbank, California. The movie was based on the Mary Poppins children's books by P. L. Travers. In the books, Poppins is a strict and pompous character, but in the movie she is transformed into a gentle and kindly character. The movie setting was changed from the 1930s of the books to the Edwardian era. Travers objected to the ""toning-down"" of the harsher aspects of the Mary Poppins character. She also objected to the songs, and any suggestion of a romance between Mary and Bert. She so hated the animated sequences that she ruled out any further adaptations of the Mary Poppins books. Disney was unsuccessful in trying to persuade her otherwise. Travers was not invited to the premiere, but asked Disney for permission to attend. At the premiere, she marched up to Disney and told him the animated sequences had to ""go"". Disney had the last word on the product, and said as he walked away, ""Pamela, the ship has sailed."" When a musical was being planned many years later, Travers refused to grant her permission for the adaptation should anyone associated with the movie be involved. The movie is about an eccentric and magical English nanny, her chimney sweep friend Bert, and two young children estranged from their busy father, a banker, and their mother, a suffragette. Poppins has the job of bringing the dysfunctional family together before she sails away on the wind. The movie stars Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins, Dick Van Dyke as her friend chimney sweep friend Bert, David Tomlinson as Mr. Banks, Glynis Johns as Mrs. Banks, and Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber as the children Jane and Michael Banks. The songs were written by the Sherman brothers, Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman. These songs include ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"", ""A Spoonful of Sugar"", ""Jolly Holiday"", ""Step in Time"", ""Feed the Birds"", and ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"", which won the Best Song Academy Award.

"Computer science is the study of how to manipulate, manage, transform and encode information. There are many different areas in computer science. Some of the areas consider problems in an abstract way. Some areas need special machines, called computers. A person who works with computers will often need mathematics, science, and logic in order to make and use computers. This is so that they can find new and easier ways to do things, and the way to approach problems with this information. Computers can do some things easily (for example: simple math, or sorting out a list of names from A-to-Z). But computers cannot answer questions when there is not enough information, or when there is no real answer. Also, computers may take too much time to finish long tasks. For example, it may take too long to find the shortest way through all of the towns in the USA - so instead a computer will try to make a close guess. A computer will answer these simpler questions much faster. Algorithms are complicated steps of instructions describing how to complete a task, such as solving a problem. Think about playing cards, for example. A computer scientist wants to sort the cards. First he wants to sort them out by color. Then he wants to order them by number (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace). The computer scientist may see different ways to sort the playing cards. He must now think about of how he will do it. When he decides, he has created an algorithm. After making the algorithm, the scientist needs to test whether the algorithm always does what it should. Then, the scientist can see how well his program sorts the cards. A simple but very slow algorithm could be: drop the cards, pick them up, and check whether they are sorted. If they are not, do it again. This method will work, but it will often take a very long time. A person may do this better by looking through all the cards, finding the first card (2 of diamonds), and putting it at the start. After this, he looks for the second card, and so on. This works much faster, and does not need much space. This sorting algorithm is a selection sort. Computer science began during World War II and separated from the other sciences during the 1960s and 1970s. Now, computer science uses special methods of doing things, and has its own special words. It is related to electrical engineering, mathematics, and language science. Computer science looks at the theoretical parts of computers. Computer engineering looks at the physical parts of computers (hardware), and software engineering looks at the use of computer programs and how to make them.",Easy

When native peoples emigrate to live in other places, they often cook and bake their familiar cuisine in their new homes. Some emigrants will make a living in the new location by opening a restaurant or grocery store, often importing special ingredients needed to cook the cuisine's dishes. People who have traveled or who want to experience new foods and flavors will enjoy these restaurants and even buy the ingredients to cook at home. People who want to cook foreign food at home need to learn from someone teaching them, or from written recipes.

"Physics, a branch of science, is the study of all forces and their impacts on the environment. Modern physics connects ideas together about the four laws of symmetry and conservation (energy, momentum, charge, and parity). The word physics comes from the Greek word ἡ φύσις ""nature"". Physics is the study of energy and matter in space and time and how they are related to each other. Physicists assume the existence of mass, length, time and electric current and then define (give the meaning of) all other physical quantities in terms of these basic units. Mass, length, time, and electric current are never defined but the standard units used to measure them are always defined. In the International System of Units (abbreviated SI from the French Système International), the kilogram is the basic unit of mass, the metre is the basic unit of length, the second is the basic unit of time, and the ampere is the basic unit of electric current. In addition to these four units, there are three other ones: the mole, which is the unit of the quantity of matter, the candela which measures the luminous intensity (the power of lighting) and the kelvin, the unit of temperature. Physics studies how things move, and the forces that make them move. For example, velocity and acceleration are used by physics to show how things move. Also, physicists study the forces of gravity, electricity, magnetism and the forces that hold things together. Physics studies very large things, and very small things. For instance, physicists can study stars, planets and galaxies but could also study small pieces of matter, such as atoms and electrons.They may also study sound, light and other waves. As well as that, they could examine energy, heat and radioactivity, and even space and time. Physics not only helps people understand how objects move, but how they change form, how they make noise, how hot or cold they will be, and what they are made of at the smallest level.",Easy

Jane Austen wrote about the English upper class and in her books are critical comments about this class. Among her most popular books are Pride and Prejudice (1813) and Emma (1815). Jane Austen grew up in a close-knit family and was a member of the lower English aristocracy. Her father taught her and her brothers mostly. She learned a lot by reading too. Her family supported her writing talent. Meanwhile, most readers read the so-called sentimental novels. She was very critical about them and developed her own writing style. Austen's novels became the transition to the more realistic ones of the nineteenth century. In her novels Austen was very critical about the position of women. At that time women were dependent on a good marriage to secure their social standing and economic security. English law was restrictive of women's rights. For example, the daughters of a man without sons could not inherit family property, which would go to a close male relative such as a cousin. Austen chose to publish her books anonymously. Although the critics were favorable, she was never recognized as the author of those books. It was not until the second half of the twentieth century that she became well-known, more than a hundred years after her dead.",Easy

"Shirley Temple (April 23, 1928 - February 10, 2014) was an American movie and television actress, singer, business woman, dancer and a diplomat. In her middle years, she became a United States ambassador, first to Ghana and then to the Czech Republic. She was also Chief of Protocol of the United States. Temple was four years old when her movie career began in 1932. She appeared in a series of satirical short movies called Baby Burlesks. These short movies were produced by Educational Pictures. Like her child costars, Temple wore diapers fastened with huge safety pins while speaking adult dialogue. Educational Pictures went bankrupt in 1933. Temple then signed with Fox Pictures. She remained with Fox for the rest of her movie career. In 1934, Temple became a household name after appearing in Bright Eyes. This movie was specifically designed for her talents. She won a special juvenile Academy Award for her 1934 movie performances. She was a superstar who made two or three movies per year. Her movies lifted the spirits of Americans weary with the Depression. Temple introduced two songs to movie audiences that have become classics: ""On the Good Ship Lollipop"" in Bright Eyes and ""Animal Crackers in My Soup"" in Curly Top. Her staircase dance with Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson in The Little Colonel is often cited as one of the great moments in movies. Movies include ""On the Good Ship Lollipop"", ""Animal Crackers in My Soup"" and "" Staircase Dance"".    As Temple entered her tweens, her charm began to fade. She made several fine movies as a teenager that include Fort Apache with Henry Fonda and The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer with Cary Grant. However, she had lost the charm that had made her a box office smash as a child. She retired completely from movies in 1950 to become a wife, mother, and homemaker. In the late 1950s, Temple hosted, narrated, and acted in a television series called Shirley Temple's Storybook. This series dramatized classic fairy tales and children's stories. Many famous Hollywood stars appeared in the series including Charlton Heston, Agnes Moorehead, and Elsa Lanchester. For the program's second season, the title was changed to The Shirley Temple Show. It faced stiff competition from a Walt Disney series, Lassie, Dennis the Menace, and a popular western. The program was cancelled at the end of the season. Temple remained on television; she appeared on talk shows and other programs in the following years. Temple devoted the years following her career as an entertainer to public service. She was a republican. She eventually became ambassador to Ghana and then to the Czech Republic. She also worked in the White House organizing dinners and parties. She had been suffering from breast cancer and was one of the first women to speak openly about the disease and her experiences with it. Temple was born on April 23, 1928 in Santa Monica, California.

"Super Mario Bros. (スーパーマリオブラザーズ in Japanese) is a 1985 platformer game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. IGN said the game was ""The Greatest Game of all Time"".  The game has a total of 8 worlds, with 4 levels each. This makes a total of 32 levels. In the fourth level of each world, you fight Bowser, but you will find that he was an imposter, and the Toads will send you to another castle. The player will only fight the real Bowser on World 8 Level 4. It is possible for the player to jump over the flagpole, however, the player will find nothing further, the background will simply repeat. The player will have to wait for the timer to get to 0, so they can continue again. Once Mario or Luigi defeats Bowser on World 8-4, you will unlock a new mode: Challenge mode. In this mode, the enemies will walk faster, all Goombas will turn into Buzzy Beetles and the levels will be harder. The creators of Mario Bros. wanted to make a game that would really make the Famicom take-off. The game was originally going to be a shooter with a very different gameplay style.  They also wanted to create an ""athletic"" game.  Mario and Luigi would have defeated enemies differently too! The player would have had to destroy the platform below the enemy to defeat them. The idea of shooting made it into the game Super Mario Land on the Game Boy. The player controls an Italian plumber, Mario, as he tries to save his love: Princess Peach. To do this he must go through eight Worlds, each time fighting the mighty Bowser. This is how Nintendo described the story in the game's manual: The game got excellent reviews at the time, including five stars from Allgame.com. The game was given two sequels. There was the version released in Japan, and the version released to other countries. The game released in Japan was called Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels. It was much harder than the original, so Nintendo thought people would find the game too difficult. The game they released was far different and was actually a remake of Doki Doki Panic. The game sold 40 million copies (29 million in North America alone) making it the second best-selling game of all time  The game was in Super Mario All-Stars for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (or Super Famicom), it was released in 1993. It had the same graphics as Super Mario World. Some glitches were fixed as well. It was later released again on the Wii as Super Mario All-Stars: 25th Anniversary Edition. Super Mario Deluxe was a game for the GameBoy Color which contained both Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels with updated graphics. It was never officially released in Japan. It is available on the Nintendo 3DS e-Shop. NES Remix 2 contained a remake of Super Mario Bros. The player took control of Luigi instead of Mario this time. The game also went right to left, instead of left to right. Otherwise, it was mostly the same game. The Minus World is a glitch where the player could reach an unplayable and buggy level. The player would have to glitch the game so that they can walk right through the wall of the first warp zone. This would teleport them to ""World -1"", the glitch was then named ""minus world"". No matter how many times the player completed the level, they would just go back to the start. To resume the game, they would need to lose all their lives, or reset their NES. The Minus World on the Japanese version was very different. In this version, there were 3 levels in the Minus World. In the levels, random characters were floating around. This time, when all 3 levels were finished, the game returned to the Title Screen. ",Easy

"In historical terms, a legacy is something that is handed down from one period of time to another period of time. A historical legacy can be counted in later times as a good thing or a bad thing. For example, the invention of the wheel (for carts, as a potters wheel, as a grinding wheel to help turn grain into flour, and as an early water wheel) in Mesopotamia can be seen as something good. The development of slavery is a bad legacy. Sometimes countries or civilizations can leave a legacy that will be remembered for a long time. Buddha and Confucius left moral legacies. More than 2000 years ago the Greek Mathematician, Euclid of Alexandria, collected and wrote down ideas about geometry and measurement in a text called Elements. Students still use these ideas when they learn about mathematics. In Athens, people voted on what the city would do. This early form of democracy is a cultural legacy. Ancient Rome elected some of their leaders and made many Roman laws that became a legal legacy for later civilizations. Roman and Greek architecture is also often imitated, as another kind of legacy. Some families pass objects and ideas down from generation to generation. These heirlooms and ideas can also be called legacies. It may have to do with a person or many people. individuals can leave a historical legacy. Legacies are, more or less, what we remember about a person or a country.

"Uno (ˈuːnoʊ Italian and Spanish for 'one'; stylized as UNO) is an American shedding-type card game that is played with a specially printed deck. The game's general principles put it into the Crazy Eights family of card games, and it is similar to the traditional European game Mau-Mau. It has been a Mattel brand since 1992. The game was originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading, Ohio, a suburb of Cicinnati. When his family and friends began to play more and more, he spent $8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made. He sold it from his barbershop at first, and local businesses began to sell it as well. Robbins later sold the rights to UNO to a group of friends headed by Robert Tezak, a funera; parlor owner in Joilet, Illnois, for $50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game. Tezak formed International Games, Inc., to market UNO, with offices behind hi funeral parlor. The games were produced by Lewis Saltzman of Saltzman Printers in Maywood Illnois. In 1992, International Games became part of the Mattel family of companies. The aim of the game is to be first player to score 500 points, achieved (usually over several rounds of play) by being the first to play all of one's own cards and scoring points for the cards still held by the other players. The deck consists of 108 cards: four each of ""Wild"" and ""Wild Draw Four,"" and 25 each of four different colors (red, yellow, green, blue). Each color consists of one zero, two each of 1 through 9, and two each of ""Skip,"" ""Draw Two,"" and ""Reverse."" These last three types are known as ""action cards."" To start a hand, seven cards are dealt to each player, and the top card of the remaining deck is flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile is an action or Wild card (see below).

"Geography is a science that describes and studies the Earth as a space where humans and nature interact. It's mostly concerned with locations and distribution on the Earth surface, trying to answer questions such as ""where?"" and ""why there?"". One major geographer's tool is the map, where he shows locations and distributions. Several maps may constitute an atlas. For the convenience of describing and analyzing the main content of geography: Natural geography is the part of geography where different parts of the earth and their structural elements are discussed. It consists mainly of the fossils, the atmosphere, the atmosphere, the earth's surface, and the global plant and animal world (biosphere) and discusses their problems and their solutions. The different branches of natural geography are as follows: The branch of science that studies the physical environment of the surface of the crust and the various geophysical processes at work in it is called natural geography. Most geographers are interested in dividing geography into two branches, natural and human. Many people divide geography into three branches namely natural, human and biogeography as it is not advisable to ignore the ecology of the biosphere on the surface. Over the past few decades, the definition, content, and reading methods of natural geography have changed dramatically. In the beginning, natural geography meant only the study of the natural environment (land friendliness, water and air). For example, according to Arthur Holmes (1960), ‘natural geography is the study of the Earth's surface friendliness, the oceans and the atmosphere that make up the natural environment. According to Carl Ritter (1779-1859), ""natural geography is the branch of science that considers the earth as a distinct unit with all its shapes, variations and relationships."" The work of natural geography provided. ' Considered from this point of view, natural geography is not only an integration of some geological subjects, it also reviews the type of interaction of human activities with the natural environment. Natural geography as an established branch of geography studies the spatial type in the regional context and the ecological relationship of the elements of the terrestrial environment. It also explains the reasons for the environmental relationship with the regional type, as well as the reasons for the change in the elements of the environment. From this it can be said that natural geography is a detailed study of the land, air, water and the biosphere that supports the life of animals and plants.",Easy
"Villa Commedia or (from Latin Villa Comoedia), it was Roman villa owned by the rich poet and Ancient Rome senator Plinio during I century, at the time of the emperor Nero. Pliny recounts that he had built Villa Commedia at Lierna Lake Como, and that he loved it more than any of his other properties: in the letter addressed to his childhood friend Voconius Romanus, Villa Commedia is mentioned among his favorite residences, which was located just a few steps from the shore of the lake, built on a rock with a wonderful view. The ""other of two villa"" ""Villa Tragedia"" of Pliny was facing sight from Lierna Lake Como, on the tip of Bellagio, today in correspondence of the estate of the sixteenth century villa Serbelloni, from 1959 owned by the Rockefeller family, while the ""Commedia villa"" was located along the lake of Lierna, in the Borgo Villa, with a terrace a few meters from the lake, from which a long reed could also fish, built on a steep rock like a Cliff Villa. Moreover the origin of the name Lierna is ""the place on the Rock"" or ""The Rock"" (from Celtic Lì Erna). To further evideence of the presence of the noble Roman villas, the remains brought to light in 1876 in Lierna Borgo Villa (named Villa for Villa Commedia), including a big mosaic, ancient gold coins, several Roman columns, and antique rome objects have been found. The mosaic and columns fragments represent the evidences of a Roman villa on the eastern shore of Lake Como, not found anywhere else in the area. The location of Villa Commedia in Lierna Lake Como, was supported by several researches, like in the early years of the twentieth century by the famous French geographer Élisée Reclus, who also he came specifically to see the places of Lierna and where he described Lierna Lake Como in Borgo Villa the location of the Villa Commedia of Pliny the younger,the place of a villa of Pliny, overhanging a rock near the shore of Lake Como, with an incredible view. Also Sigismondo Boldoni, who inspired Alessandro Manzoni, identified the position of the villa Commedia, in Borgo Villa, on the slopes of a rock of Lierna overlooking Lake Como, built as on terraces and cliffs on the rock hill, as it is done on the Baia, on the gulf of Pozzuoli. In 1751 John Boyle, V Earl of Cork, a close friend of Alexander Pope, he published an English translation of Pliny's letters. The letter to Voconius Romanus which describes the villas of the Comedy and of the Tragedy was illustrated by him with a totally fantasy representation, and not corresponding to reality, of the villa of the Comedy, realized by Samuel Wale, but inspired by the villa of the Pope on the Thames.",Easy

"Player Unknown's Battleground (PUBG or PubG) is an online multiplayer Battle Royale created and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game is based on previous modes created by Brendon ""Player Unknown"" Green, inspired by Battle Royale to use other games, and expanded to a separate game under Brendon Green. In the game, a hundred players have to parachute on an island and fight among themselves with different weapons to survive. Weapons and equipment have to be collected from different places on the map. The size of the safe zone on the map tends to get smaller over time, allowing players to meet and fight each other. The one who fights among himself as the last man standing is the winner. The game was released for Microsoft Windows in March 2016 through Steam's advance access beta program, and was fully released on December 20, 2017. That same month, the game was released by Microsoft Studios for Xbox One under its Xbox Game Preview program. A few months later, it was localized and released by Tencent Games in China, where two mobile versions based on the game were released for Android and iOS. As of June 2018, it is one of the best-selling games of all time, with nearly 50 million sales on all platforms. Also, the Windows version tops Steam at the same time in terms of the number of players playing the game, which is the all-time high of this platform. PUBG has received a number of positive reviews from critics both during its first access and final release; Critics have found that when the game is not fully finished and there are some technical glitches, PUBG introduces a new type of gameplay that can be played by players of any skill and is a game worthy of replay. Among other accolades, the game has received several Game of the Year nominations, and Green has been considered by Royal War Games as the defining game in the world. Many other video games, in continuation of PUBG's success, have added combat royal style mode, moreover multiple clones were initially created outside of China. PUBG Corporation has organized a number of small competitions and introduced in-game equipment to help viewers broadcast the game, so that they would like to become a popular sport. PUBG is a player vs. player action game where 100 players fight in Battle Royale, a large-scale Last Man Standing match is held, where players continue to fight to the end. Each match begins with a parachute landing on a map measuring approximately 6 × 8 km (5.0 × 5.0 m). The flight path of the plane is at different places on the map depending on the match, players need to land on the ground by parachute in a quick and accurate place. Even if the players have customized their clothes from the east, it does not affect the game. Once they land, players can search buildings and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor and other equipment. These items are effectively distributed across the map at the start of a match, especially in high-risk areas where there is usually good equipment. Kill other players as well as acquire their gears (equipment). Players can also play from a first person or third person perspective. Each has its own advantages as well as disadvantages in war and situational awareness. Every few minutes, the playable area on the map begins to shrink to an irregular position, the amount of damage (damage) increases if any player is out of the safe zone, and the player is eliminated if the safe zone is not entered in time.; In the game, players see the border as a flashing blue wall that moves over time. As the amount of safe zones on the map gradually decreases, the chances of encounters between players increase. During the match, red and bomb blasts are highlighted in unspecified areas of the map, posing a threat to players in that area. In both cases, players are warned a few minutes before the incident, provided their safety replacement is provided. Randomly, a plane flies to different parts of the playable map and drops various necessary equipment through a loot package, which is not available during normal gameplay. These packages emit highly visible red smoke, attracting interested players closer to it and making players more exposed. On average, a full round takes no more than 30 minutes. At each round completed, players gain in-game currency based on how long they have survived fighting, how many players they have killed, and how much damage other players have suffered. Coins are used by players to purchase a variety of items, including decoration items for character or weapon customization. A rotating ""event mode"" was added to the game around March 2016. These events change the rules of normal play, such as the placement of large teams or squads, or the distribution of weapons and armor throughout the game map.",Easy
"The Brandenburg Gate (German: Brandenburger Tor) is a monument in Berlin, the capital of Germany.

"Florence Nightingale, (12 May 1820 – 13 August 1910), was an English nurse. She helped create the modern techniques of nursing. She became a leader of the team of nurses who helped wounded soldiers during the Crimean War. She was the first female to receive the Order of Merit, the highest honour awarded to a British person. As a nurse she was given the name 'The Lady with the Lamp' because at night, she checked on the wounded soldiers and always carried 'The Lamp' with her. She helped make modern nursing possible. Nightingale wrote a lot. She lived to be 90 years old. In her lifetime she was concerned with spreading medical knowledge. Some of her books were written in simple English so that they could easily be understood by those with poor reading skills. She also was an early user of graphs and diagrams to display data. Nightingale was helped to understand statistics by her country's leading expert on public statistics, William Farr. He was a founder of medical statistics, and epidemiology. Farr worked with her on all the statistics from the Crimean War, which she publicised in her writing. She proved that more men had died from disease than fighting, a very important piece of information. The disease in question was mostly cholera. Cholera is caused by a bacterium which is spread by people drinking water which is contaminated by sewage. Unfortunately, both she and Farr believed the disease was caused by foul air: this was called the miasma theory. The miasma theory was refuted by John Snow, who discovered the real cause of an outbreak in London. The cause was foul water from a water pump in Broad Street, London. Snow's work was published in 1855, but it was 30 years before the germ theory was generally accepted. Farr publicly acknowledged he was wrong in 1866, but Nightingale never really gave up the miasma idea. London's cholera epidemics stopped once the authorities built sewage treatment plants, delivered cleaner water, and built a system of underground pipes which kept sewage from seeping into the water supply. Florence Nightingale was born into an upper class British family in 1820 in Florence, Tuscany, Italy. She was named after the town where she was born. The family moved back to London when Florence was a young girl. She was a Unitarian. Although her parents expected her to become a wife and a mother, in 1845 she decided to become a nurse. While she was training she campaigned for better conditions for poor people in Britain. In 1854 when the Crimean War began, Florence was working in Harley Street in London. After reading many reports about the poor treatment of sick and injured soldiers, she travelled to Crimea to see for herself and discovered the hospitals were crowded and dirty. She knew Sidney Herbert, who was Secretary of War during the Crimean War and he helped her. At the hospital in Istanbul where the injured soldiers were sent, Florence realized that soldiers died more often from diseases like cholera than from their injuries in war. She used her knowledge of maths and statistics to show the British government that providing better conditions for sick and injured soldiers would help them win the war. She was, however, quite wrong about how cholera spread. There is a syndrome named after her called ""Florence Nightingale Syndrome"". It occurs when a soldier falls in love with a nurse. While she was working in Crimea she became known as “The Lady with the Lamp” because she would walk around the hospital in the evening carrying a lamp and check on the soldiers. When she returned to England she started a school in 1860 for nurses at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London. She wrote her most important book Notes on Nursing. She was a keen Christian but also believed that pagan and eastern religions also contained genuine worth. She was a strong opponent of discrimination against all types of Christians as well as against non-Christians. Nightingale believed religion helped provide people with the fortitude for arduous good work. In 1907, Florence Nightingale became the first woman to be awarded the Order of Merit by King Edward VII. Nightingale died in 1910 in London. There are many statues of her in Britain, including one in Waterloo Place in London and a Florence Nightingale museum, also in London.",Easy

"A conspiracy is when there is a lot of people who are working on something in secret and they don't tell anybody about. It can also be a lie that starts as just an idea or a rumour, in order to trick people into doing something. It is also called a conspiracy theory, because sometimes it is just an idea that is not true and that is very difficult to prove or disprove because if it was true then it is supposed to be a secret, which provides an excuse for the lack of proof. There have been many conspiracies in the history of the world and they are usually connected to people trying to take things from other people without the other people noticing until it is too late. There are a lot of conspiracy theories because anybody can make one up and it because it is supposed to be secret. A good example is the word tank. Today everybody knows that a tank is a vehicle with a turret on it, a cannon, but when the first tanks were built, they didn't want people to know that they are building weapons, so they said that they are building water tanks.

"Gravity, or gravitation, is one of the fundamental forces of the universe. In this article, we discuss it in three parts: Some physicists think gravity is caused by gravitons, but they are still unsure. In everyday talk, we say things fall because the Earth's gravity pulls on them. We talk as if our weight was a ""given"". Actually, weight changes when the pull of gravity changes. The Moon is much smaller and the pull of gravity on the Moon is about 16th that of Earth. So any object on the Moon weighs 16th of its weight on Earth. What does not change is the amount of matter in an object. That is called its mass. On Earth, mass and weight are the same, for practical purposes. The trip to the Moon shows they are not really the same. From this we learn two things. The Earth has mass. Every particle of matter has mass. So the Earth pulls on every object and person and they pull on the Earth. Gravity pulls on the mass and gives it weight. These words mean almost the same thing in everyday use. Sometimes scientists use ""gravity"" for the force that pulls objects towards each other, and ""gravitation"" for the theory about the attraction. In the late 17th century, Galileo did a famous experiment about gravity where he dropped balls from the Tower of Pisa. He later rolled balls down inclines. With these experiments, Galileo showed that gravitation accelerates all objects at the same rate regardless of weight. The man who really worked it all out was Johannes Kepler, who, after ""900 pages of calculations and many false starts and dead-end ideas"", finally got these three laws: In 1687, English mathematician Isaac Newton wrote the Principia. In this book, he wrote about the inverse-square law of gravitation. Newton said that the closer two objects are to each other, the more gravity will affect them. His theory about gravitation was used to predict the existence of the planet Neptune based on changes in the orbit of Uranus. Newton's theory was later used to predict the existence of another planet closer to the Sun than Mercury. When this was done, it was learned that his theory was not entirely correct. These mistakes in his theory were corrected by Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Newton's theory is still commonly used for many things because it is much more simple to work with than the theory of General Relativity and is usually accurate enough for many uses. Why does the Earth not fall into the Sun? The answer is simple but very important. It is because the Earth moving round the Sun is in a dynamic equilibrium. The speed of the Earth's movement creates a centrifugal force which balances the gravitational force between the Sun and the Earth. Why does the Earth continue spinning? Because there is no force to stop it. Newton's first law: ""If a body is at rest it remains at rest or if it is in motion it moves at the same speed until it is acted on by an external force"". There is a kind of analogy between centrifugal force and gravitational force, which led to the ""equivalence principle"" of general relativity. A situation when a thing's motion balances out the pull of gravity on it. The special theory of relativity describes systems where gravity is not an issue; by contrast, gravity is the central issue of the general theory of relativity. In general relativity there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths. Instead, gravity is seen as changes in the properties of space and time. In turn, this changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow. The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energy–momentum of matter. Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve. For weak gravitational fields and slow speeds relative to the speed of light, the theory's predictions converge on those of Newton's law of universal gravitation. Newton's equations are used to plan journeys in our Solar System. General relativity has a number of physical consequences. Gravity influences the passage of time. Light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted, whereas light sent in the opposite direction (i.e., climbing out of the gravity well) is redshifted; collectively, these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift. More generally, processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation. General relativity predicts that the path of light is bent in a gravitational field; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body. This effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the Sun. Closely related to light deflection is the gravitational time delay (or Shapiro delay), the phenomenon that light signals take longer to move through a gravitational field than they would in the absence of that field. There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction. A parameter called γ encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space. Gravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of spacetime. They move as a wave, travelling outward from the source. Einstein predicted them in 1915 on the basis of his theory of general relativity. In theory, gravitational waves transport energy as gravitational radiation. Sources of detectable gravitational waves might include binary star systems composed of white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. In general relativity, gravitational waves cannot travel faster than the speed of light. Although gravitational radiation has not been directly detected, there is indirect evidence for its existence. The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for measurements of the Hulse-Taylor binary star system. These measurements suggest gravitational waves are more than mathematical peculiarities. Various gravitational wave detectors exist. However, they have not yet detected the phenomena.",Easy

"Sharia law (in Arabic: شريعة) is the body of Islamic law. The term means ""way"" or ""path""; it is the legal framework within which the public and some private aspects of life are regulated for those living in a legal system based on Islam. Sharia deals with all aspects of day-to-day life, including politics, economics, banking, business law, contract law, sexuality, and social issues. There is not a strictly codified uniform set of laws that can be called Sharia. It is more like a system of several laws, based on the Qur'an, Hadith and centuries of debate, interpretation and precedent. Sharia law is divided into three main sections: See mu`amalat laws according to 5 major schools of jurisprudence and The Majallah The Qur'an and several hadith set out two different punishments for theft (stealing). They say that the punishment should depend on how many times the person stole, and what he stole. One punishment is imprisonment. Another is amputating (cutting off) the hands or feet. However, before a person is punished, two eyewitnesses must swear, under oath, that they saw the person stealing. If this does not happen, then the punishment cannot be carried out. Also, some other requirements have to be met. These requirements have to do with the theft, what was stolen, and how the theft happened. All of these requirements must be met, as decided by a judge.Template:Cite quran Hadith says that if married men and women commit adultery (sleep with a person they are not married to), the punishment should be 100 lashes. It is not stoning to death as some people believe. There are some requirements that need to be met before this punishment can happen. For example, the punishment cannot happen unless the person confesses, or unless four male eyewitnesses each saw, at the same time, the man and the women in the action of adultery. Every requirement must be met, as decided by a judge, before the punishment can happen.(Qur'an 24:2) For unmarried men and women, the punishment set out in the Qur'an and hadith is 100 lashes. There are two festivals that are considered Sunnah. During these festivals, specific rituals are used: Islamic law does not list every food and drink that is thought to be pure. It does list some specific foods and drinks that are not allowed. While Islamic law prohibits (does not allow) dead meat, this does not apply to fish and locusts. Also, hadith literature prohibits beasts having sharp canine teeth, birds having claws and tentacles in their feet, Jallalah (animals whose meat stinks because they feed on filth), tamed donkeys, and any piece cut from a living animal. Most interpretations (or ways of understanding Sharia) do not allow Muslims to convert to other religions. This is strictly forbidden, and is called apostasy. In Muslim theology, apostasy is equal to treason. In most interpretations of Sharia, the punishment for apostasy is death. In many Muslim countries, some people may be accused of apostasy even if they have non-conventional (non-traditional or unusual) interpretations of the Quran. The severe persecution of the famous expert in Arabic literature, Prof. Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd, is an example of this. In some countries, Sunni and Shia Muslims often accuse each other of apostasy. Many people explain the current civil conflict in Iraq by pointing to the very harsh religious opposition between Sunnis and Shias in the country.",Easy

"Folk culture is a part of the culture of Bangladesh. The common culture has been nurtured for ages and therefore the folk culture in the general sense. This culture is known as folk culture as it is prevalent in the mouths of the people. This culture is usually influenced by the rural people-centered livelihood system, the social norms. People have been following this culture for thousands of years. This culture flows with religious beliefs, processes of action, entertainment. The name of this culture based on these things is known as folk culture. Born in the mouths of ordinary people, this culture has spread from one generation to another for thousands of years. Much has changed in this folk culture that is being told by people. Its journey started from the rural agrarian society. In many ways, different trends have been created in this culture- Elements of folk culture: The things that have the identity of folk culture are called the elements of folk culture. These elements are of two types e.g. A) Material material and B) Material material. Material: The material elements that can be touched in folk culture are material. Such as - weaving, bronze, pottery, nakshi kantha, fishing, etc. Objective material: All the aspects of folk culture that cannot be grasped or touched, that is, born from human thought and spread by word of mouth, are called objective material of folk culture. Literature is the main subject of material. Other material elements include folk songs, khanar bachan, rhymes, proverbs, etc. Examples of conventional folk culture: Our country still has a large conventional folk culture. Folk culture has spread from generation to generation. Again some folk culture is lost in the flow of time. Below are some examples of conventional folk culture: (1) A large part of the material element of folk culture is the ceremony of wearing yellow. Yellow on the skin is a big part of our culture. Different types of rituals and reforms are performed centering on the yellow ritual on the body. (2) The material element or belief of folk culture performed for rain. The event is held to call for rain to relieve the long drought. To get the rain down, the village girls go from house to house with open and sing rain songs or rhymes in their mouths. Then the girls of the house poured water on the opening. They believe that this is how rain will come down from the sky. The main reason for calling for rain in this way is the liberation of farmers from drought. (3) Nakshi Kantha is one of the elements of the folk culture of Bangladesh. At present, Nakshi Kantha is very popular in Bangladesh and there is a lot of demand abroad. The exquisite and eye-catching design of Nakshi Kantha attracts everyone's attention. Nakshi Kantha is made from house to house in different parts of Bangladesh, especially in Jessore and Jamalpur villages. (4) The element of folk culture that is equally prevalent in cities and villages in the fair. Fairs can be seen all over Bangladesh. Especially Baishakhi Mela occupies a special place in the city. Numerous shops are built around this fair. Where many parts of folk culture are found. Such as nakshi Kantha, earthenware, children's dolls, and toys, carousel, bioscope, puppet dance, journey, etc. Influence of folk culture in our life People of almost all ethnic groups in Bangladesh celebrate with songs and dances. Dancing for Radha-Krishna is the favorite of Manipuris. This is called gopi dance. In the spring we celebrate Holi with pomp. Like all other ethnic groups in the world, there are different kinds of beliefs among the people of the small ethnic groups in Bangladesh. For example, the night of the full moon and the new moon are of special significance to Manipuri and other Buddhist communities. We also celebrate many religious and cultural festivals on the night of the full moon. On the other hand, Bengali New Year is another festival. All the countries of the world are associated with one or another religion or festival. But this festival has no religious connotation. The festival is especially associated with agriculture and business. On this day all the debts of the workplace are calculated. As a result, day by day it became a festival of universal joy.",Easy

"Operation Eikonal is a collaboration between the National Security Agency (NSA) and Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) for the sharing of telephony and Internet data captured in Germany. It is based on an agreement that dates to 2002, and is part of the NSA operation ""RAMPART-A"". Surveillance started in 2003, telephony data was collected from 2004 onwards, and all Internet traffic from the Deutsche Telekom (DT) switching center in Frankfurt was captured starting in 2005. To obtain the data, the BND and DT worked together. The agents rented two rooms in the DT data center in Frankfurt where the fiber optic data cable owned by DT was spliced into, and a copy of the data was captured. DT received 6000 euros monthly for its role in giving access to data. A filtering program named Dafis was used to prevent the sharing of data from German citizens; however, that filter was estimated to be only 95% effective, meaning that 5% of data was obtained in breach of Germany's constitution (Grundgesetz). Later, during parliamentary hearings conducted on November 6, 2014, one witness claimed that the 95% figure was only correct for the initial testing and that during operation, 99% of data from German citizens was filtered out. In January 2006, the Bad Aibling branch of the BND reported to its headquarters in Pullach that the ""selectors"" (search terms) used by the NSA under the programme included some terms targeting the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) and the Eurocopter project as well as French administration. These selectors were first noticed by BND employees in 2005. Other selectors were found to target the administration of Austria. After the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden the BND decided to investigate the issue; their October 2013 conclusion was that at least 2,000 of these selectors were aimed at Western European or even German interests which has been a violation of the Memorandum of Agreement that the US and Germany signed in 2002 in the wake of the 911 terror attacks. After reports emerged in 2014 that EADS and Eurocopter had been surveillance targets the Left Party and the Greens filed an official request to obtain evidence of the violations. The BND's project group charged with supporting the NSA investigative committee in German parliament set up in spring 2014, reviewed the selectors and discovered 40,000 suspicious search parameters, including espionage targets in Western European governments and numerous companies. The group also confirmed suspicions that the NSA had systematically violated German interests and concluded that the Americans could have perpetrated economic espionage directly under the Germans' noses. The investigative parliamentary committee was not granted access to the NSA's selectors list as an appeal led by opposition politicians failed at Germany's top court – instead the ruling coalition appointed an administrative judge, Kurt Graulich, as a ""person of trust"" who was granted access to the list and briefed the investigative commission on its contents after analyzing the 40,000 parameters. In his almost 300-page report Graulich concluded that European government agencies were targeted massively and that Americans hence broke contractual agreements. He also found that German targets which received special protection from surveillance of domestic intelligence agencies by Germany's Basic Law (Grundgesetz) – including numerous enterprises based in Germany − were featured in the NSA's wishlist in a surprising plenitude. While the magnitude differs, there have also been problematic BND-internal selectors which have been used until end of 2013 - around two thirds of 3300 targets were related to EU and NATO states. Klaus Landefeld, member of the board at the Internet industry association Eco International, has met intelligence officials and legislators to present suggestions for improvement, like streamlining the selector system. Information on Operation Eikonal was first unveiled by Süddeutsche Zeitung, Norddeutscher Rundfunk and Westdeutscher Rundfunk on October 3, 2014. Although some documents suggested that the operation had been completed in 2008, it was revealed that in December 2012, there were still transfers of 500 million metadata per month being made. Of these 500 million datasets, 180 million were captured using XKeyscore. Austrian member of parliament Peter Pilz described the operation as ""the first successful attempt at mass surveillance of European telecommunications"".",Normal
"In mathematics, the Tamagawa number τ ( G ) {displaystyle tau (G)} of a semisimple algebraic group defined over a global field k is the measure of G ( A ) G ( k ) {displaystyle G(mathbb {A} )G(k)} , where A {displaystyle mathbb {A} } is the adele ring of k. Tamagawa numbers were introduced by Tamagawa(1966), and named after him by Weil(1959). Tsuneo Tamagawa's observation was that, starting from an invariant differential form ω on G, defined over k, the measure involved was well-defined: while ω could be replaced by cω with c a non-zero element of k {displaystyle k} , the product formula for valuations in k is reflected by the independence from c of the measure of the quotient, for the product measure constructed from ω on each effective factor. The computation of Tamagawa numbers for semisimple groups contains important parts of classical quadratic form theory. Let k be a global field, A its ring of adeles, and G a semisimple algebraic group defined over k. Choose Haar measures on the completions kv of k such that Ov has volume 1 for all but finitely many places v. These then induce a Haar measure on A, which we further assume is normalized so that Ak has volume 1 with respect to the induced quotient measure. The Tamagawa measure on the adelic algebraic group G(A) is now defined as follows. Take a left-invariant n-form ω on G(k) defined over k, where n is the dimension of G. This, together with the above choices of Haar measure on the kv, induces Haar measures on G(kv) for all places of v. As G is semisimple, the product of these measures yields a Haar measure on G(A), called the Tamagawa measure. The Tamagawa measure does not depend on the choice of ω, nor on the choice of measures on the kv, because multiplying ω by an element of k* multiplies the Haar measure on G(A) by 1, using the product formula for valuations. The Tamagawa number τ(G) is defined to be the Tamagawa measure of G(A)G(k). Weil's conjecture on Tamagawa numbers states that the Tamagawa number τ(G) of a simply connected (i.e. not having a proper algebraic covering) simple algebraic group defined over a number field is 1. Weil(1959) calculated the Tamagawa number in many cases of classical groups and observed that it is an integer in all considered cases and that it was equal to 1 in the cases when the group is simply connected. Ono (1963) found examples where the Tamagawa numbers are not integers, but the conjecture about the Tamagawa number of simply connected groups was proven in general by several works culminating in a paper by Kottwitz(1988) and for the analogue over function fields over finite fields by Gaitsgory & Lurie (2019).",Normal

"The Bloody Banquet is an early 17th-century play, a revenge tragedy of uncertain date and authorship, attributed on its title page only to ""T.D."" It has attracted a substantial body of critical and scholarly commentary, chiefly for the challenging authorship problem it presents. It has been attributed to a collaboration between Thomas Dekker and Thomas Middleton. The Bloody Banquet was never entered into the Register of the Stationers Company, but an order from the Lord Chamberlain (then Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke), dated 19 August 1639, lists it among forty plays that are the property of William Beeston and can be performed only by his company, Beeston's Boys. It was first published in quarto in the same year, 1639, by Thomas Cotes, with the attribution to ""T. D."" on its title page. The play draws its plot from Pan His Syrinx (1584, 1597) by William Warner. The playwright(s) took elements from four of the seven stories in Warner's volume, to create a revenge tale in which a Tyrant serves up a cannibal banquet, only to be assassinated at the dining table, yielding the ""bloody banquet"" of the title. The sole extant text of the play is only about 1900 lines in length, roughly 500 lines shorter than the average for plays of its era; discontinuities in the text suggest that it was edited before publication. The drama's date is uncertain, although its general style and tone place it sometime after 1600. Some seventeenth-century sources point to Thomas Dekker as the ""T. D."" of the title page. Nineteenth-century critic F. G. Fleay identified T. D. as Thomas Drue on the strength of the common initials – but since virtually nothing is known about Drue (the author of only one acknowledged play, The Duchess of Suffolk), the attribution offered little enlightenment, and left the field open for other candidates. Robert Davenport was also suggested as a possibility. In 1925, E. H. C. Oliphant first linked the name of Thomas Middleton with the play; he argued that The Bloody Banquet was a DekkerMiddleton collaboration. Further research and the use of stylistic analysis has brought about a consensus that the authors were Dekker and Middleton. David Lake, in his 1975 analysis of attribution problems in the Middleton canon, suggested that ""The play is a much-revised one, written originally by Middleton with some help from Dekker about 1600–02"" — though he acknowledged this as only one possibility. Macdonald Jackson strengthened the case for Middleton two decades later. More recently, Gary Taylor has included it Middleton's Collected Works (2007), and has argued that the play was originally written by Middleton and Dekker in 1608–09, and then adapted in the 1620s. A 21st-century adaptation is available. Induction The play's back story is acted out in pantomime and narrated by the Chorus: After seven long, bloody battles, the King of Lydia and the King of Lycia agreed to a peace treaty. As a pledge of faith, the treaty was sealed by an exchange of hostages. The King of Lydia traded his nephew, Lapyrus, for the King of Lycia's son, Zantippus. Shortly after the exchange, the King of Lycia offered Lapyrus the hand of his beautiful daughter Eurymone if Lapyrus would turn traitor against his uncle. Lapyrus agreed to the deal, married Eurymone, and led an army to attack Lydia. As Lapyrus' army attacked, the King of Lydia sent his son, Tymethes, to enlist the aid of The King of Cilicia. Meanwhile, The Queen of Lydia took her two infant sons and fled to a forest, certain the kingdom would soon come to ruin. Shortly thereafter, the King of Cilicia arrived in Lydia, forced Lapyrus' army to withdraw, and saved the King. As it soon turned out, however, the King of Cilia had treacherous notions of his own... Scene 1: The presence chamber of the King of Lydia The King of Cilia (hereafter referred to as ""the Tyrant"") enters the presence chamber of the King of Lydia, sits on the throne, and proclaims himself king. The Old King of Lydia protests, but his objections are quickly swept away by the Tyrant, who insists that he will now sit as ruler of Lydia while his son Zenarchus takes over as ruler of Cilicia. Zenarchus kneels and begs his father to act honourably and show pity on the Old King of Lydia, but this petition is quickly countered by objections from the Tyrant's shrewd advisor, Mazeres. Resigning himself to his fate, the Old King of Lydia retires from the court accompanied by two faithful servants, Fidelo and Amorpho. Two other servants, Sertorio and Lodovico, decide to forsake the Old King and enter into the Tyrant's service. Zenarchus begs his father to allow his friend, Tymethes, the Old King's son, to remain at court. He argues that Tymethes has a gentle nature, and would not pose any threat. Mazeres notes that a gesture of kindness toward the Old King's son would be politically astute because it would make the Tyrant look good. The Tyrant agrees to let Tymethes remain at court. Everyone exits except Zenarchus and Tymethes. Zenarchus bemoans the influence Mazeres holds over his father. Tymethes lies down on the ground, certain that he must be dreaming. Zenarchus assures him that he is not. Tymethes says that (despite the loss of the kingdom, his mother's uncertain whereabouts, and his father's banishment) his primary concern is that Zenarchus' sister Amphridote will not dare love him any longer for fear of her father's disapproval. Zenarchus reassures Tymethes that Amphridote's love will certainly remain constant. Amphridote enters. Tymethes asks her if she will still love him now that he is a beggar. Amphridote says she will. Zenarchus praises his sister and vows to return the kingdom to Tymethes after the Tyrant's death. Mazeres enters, unnoticed, and observes the conversation. Tymethes and Amphridote kiss. Mazeres is shocked to see the princess kiss a ""beggar."" Everyone exits except Mazeres, who soliloquises about his love for Amphridote and his determination to get rid of Tymethes. Scene 2: A forest Disguised as a beggar, the Old Queen of Lydia bemoans her fate and wonders aloud what will become of her two infant sons. Scene 3: Another part of the forest Lapyrus enters, disguised with a false beard. He curses himself for betraying his king and country. As he prepares to commit suicide, the Old Queen enters pursued by a pair of soldiers intent on raping her. Lapyrus chases the soldiers away. The Old Queen thanks him and tells him her story. He complains bitterly about her nephew, the ""traitorous villain"" Lapyrus. Lapyrus is tormented to see the Old Queen (his aunt) in such miserable straits. Keeping his identity secret, he tells her that he has recently seen Lapyrus in the forest. Assuring the Old Queen that Lapyrus is truly penitent, he asks her what she would do if she should happen to cross paths with her traitorous nephew. The Old Queen says she would kill him. Lapyrus gives the Old Queen his sword, kneels, removes his false beard, and encourages her to take his life. The Old Queen decides to pardon Lapyrus, but only on the condition that he provide for her and her children. Lapyrus agrees to become the Old Queen's provider. Scene 4: Outside the Young Queen's rooms Tymethes is quite moody because of his love for Amphridote. To cheer him up, Zenarchus arranges to meet his stepmother, the Queen, a beautiful young woman whom the Tyrant keeps imprisoned under strict supervision. Tymethes is immediately struck by the Young Queen's beauty. The Young Queen, in turn, falls in love with Tymethes at first sight. Tymethes flirts with the Young Queen by raising a toast in her honour. She refrains from returning the gesture for fear of revealing her true feelings. Tymethes toasts her again, and once again, the Young Queen declines to respond in kind. Erroneously assuming that he has been snubbed because of his lower social status, Tymethes storms off without a word. Zenarchus follows. Left alone, the Young Queen soliloquises about her love for Tymethes. She cautions herself to proceed carefully, but notes that she does not have to worry too much about the attendants who watch over her because they can be bribed with ease. The Tyrant enters, angry to find that his wife is not being watched by her attendants. After noting the importance of keeping women under strict observance, he greets his wife warmly and anticipates the sexual pleasure they will share that night. The Young Queen's attendant, Roxano, enters. The Tyrant and the Young Queen kiss and exit together. In a soliloquy brimming with sexual innuendo, Roxano says that he can tell from the Young Queen's face that she intends to deceive her husband. Noting that women desire sex above all else, he says that he would happily provide her with ""service"" if the chance should arise. The Young Queen enters. In an aside, she notes that her desire for Tymethes has become uncontrollable. Roxano asks the cause of her dissatisfaction. The Young Queen tells him about her infatuation. Roxano agrees to help the Young Queen arrange a rendezvous with Tymethes. The Young Queen insists that Tymethes must lie with her without knowing her true identity, a measure necessary to guard against the Tyrant's obsessive jealousy. After worrying about what might happen if her deception should be discovered, the Young Queen swoons. Roxano catches her in his arms. When she awakens, Roxano tells her that he will make all of the arrangements right away: The Young Queen will sleep with Tymethes, but Tymethes will not know her in the morning. The Young Queen thanks Roxano and gives him some gold. Scene 1: Outside a sheepcote; a fruit tree beside a pit In this short comic interlude, a Clown and two Shepherds lie boughs over an open pit to trap wolves. In a series of witty exchanges, the Clown says there are four types of wolves 1) court wolves (the elites), 2) country wolves (farmers), 3) city wolves (urbanites), and 4) sea wolves (sailors). Scene 2: Outside a sheepcote; a fruit tree beside a pit Lapyrus enters complaining about the cruelty of Nature and the difficulty of finding food. Approaching the tree to pick some fruit, he falls in the pit and screams for help. The Clown enters and asks his name. When Lapyrus identifies himself, the Clown calls him a traitorous villain, replaces the boughs covering the pit, and exits. Scene 3: The Lydian Castle; outdoors Tymethes, Amphridote and Zenarchus notice that they are being observed by Mazeres (the Tyrant's advisor). Tymethes kisses Amphridote to make Mazeres jealous. Enraged, Mazeres vows to get rid of Tymethes and exits. Roxano enters disguised as a beggar. He pulls Tymethes aside and tells him that a beautiful young lady wants to sleep with him, but Tymethes cannot know her name. They make arrangements for to meet at a lodge at five pm the next day. Scene 4: Outside a sheepcote; a fruit tree beside a pit The Old King of Lydia enters bemoaning the loss of his wife. He is accompanied by his servants, Fidelio and Amorpho. Lapyrus calls out for help from the pit. Fidelio and Amorpho pull Lapyrus out of the pit. The Old King immediately (and rather unexpectedly) forgives Lapyrus on the spot. Lapyrus tells The Old King that the Old Queen is safe, and promises to re-unite the royal pair immediately. Scene 5: Pantomime This scene is acted out in pantomime and narrated by the Chorus: One of the Old Queen's infant sons died of hunger while the Old Queen was waiting for Lapyrus to bring back some food. While the Old Queen was burying her dead baby, some shepherds came along and rescued the remaining child from certain starvation. The Old Queen went off with them, posing as the baby's wet-nurse. When Lapyrus and the Old King returned to find the Old Queen gone, they assumed she had died, and left in a state of extreme grief. Scene 1: The lodge where Tymethes is supposed to meet Roxano Roxano enters, enviously contemplating Tymethes' date with the Young Queen: ""I that could never aspire above a dairy wench, the very cream of my fortunes—that he should bathe in nectar, and I most unfortunate in buttermilk, this is good dealing now, is't?"" Mazeres enters and offers Roxano a healthy sum of gold if he will kill Tymethes. Roxano accepts the offer. Tymethes enters. Mazeres exits. Roxano re-assumes his ""beggar"" disguise and tells Tymethes that he must wear a hood over his head before he can be brought to the ""anonymous young lady."" Tymethes agrees to don the hood, and Roxano leads him off-stage. Scene 2: A room in the lodge The Young Queen forces her servants to take an oath of secrecy and loyalty and then gives them documents detailing the roles they must play in facilitating her secret date with Tymethes. Scene 3: A banqueting room in the lodge Roxano leads Tymethes (still hooded) into a richly decorated banquet hall. Tymethes' hood is removed. He is amazed at the extravagance of his surroundings. The Young Queen's servants, all wearing masks, attend on him. Disguised as one of the masked servants, Mazeres pours Tymethes some poisoned wine. Tymethes spills the wine by mistake. The Young Queen enters, masked and wearing her nightgown. Tymethes is very pleased. The Young Queen exits. Roxano gives Tymethes a nightshirt and tells him there are five hundred gold crowns in the sleeve—advance payment for his ""services"". In addition to the crowns, Tymethes finds a note from the Young Queen in the sleeve. In the note, she promises him a night of pleasure, but begs him to keep their encounter a safely guarded secret. Tymethes exits to meet his ""lady"". Roxano follows. Left alone on stage, Mazeres removes his mask. Frustrated that his attempt at murder was foiled, he makes plans to ruin Tymethes by telling the Tyrant about his encounter with the Young Queen. Scene 1: A room in the castle Tymethes shows Zenarchus a jewel he stole during his encounter with the mysterious young ""lady"". He says he hopes to use the jewel to gain knowledge of the ""lady's"" identity. Mazeres and the Tyrant enter unnoticed and observe from a corner. Amphridote enters and kisses Tymethes. The Tyrant is enraged. Amphridote notices the jewel stolen from the ""lady"" and asks Tymethes to give it to her as present. Tymethes gives it to her, but makes her promise to keep it hidden. They kiss. Zenarchus and Amphridote exit. The Tyrant vows to put an end to his daughter's relationship and exits with Mazeres following. Alone on stage, Tymethes says he is determined to discover the mysterious ""lady's"" identity. Roxano and Mazeres enter unnoticed and observe Tymethes. At Mazeres' urging, Roxano approaches Tymethes and offers to arrange another meeting with the ""lady."" Tymethes readily accepts the offer. They agree to meet at the lodge again soon. Scene 2: Another room in the castle The Tyrant summons Amphridote and scolds her for carrying on with a ""beggar"" (Tymethes). He demands that she turn over any gifts that Tymethes may have given her. Amphridote gives him the jewel Tymethes stole from the Young Queen. The Tyrant recognises the jewel immediately and asks Mazeres how it could have fallen into Tymethes' hands. Mazeres tells the Tyrant everything about the Young Queen's secret meeting with Tymethes at the lodge. The Tyrant falls into a jealous rage. Laying plans to catch the Young Queen red-handed, he tells his servant to spread a rumour that he has travelled far away from the castle. Everyone exits except Amphridote. She is shocked at the news of Tymethes' philandering. Mazeres enters. Disgusted with Tymethes, Amphridote tells Mazeres that she has decided to love him instead. Mazeres is pleased. Scene 3: The Young Queen's bedchamber Roxano leads Tymethes (hooded once again) into the Young Queen's bedchamber. Tymethes' hood is removed and Roxano exits. Tymethes wakes the Young Queen up. She is upset when she sees him, certain that his indiscretion will be the cause of their ruin. When Tymethes protests, she tells him that if he kneels and spends an hour in repentant prayer, she will spend the night with him once again. Tymethes kneels to pray. The Young Queen exits, returns with two pistols, and shoots Tymethes dead. The Tyrant enters. The Young Queen tells him that she was forced to shoot Tymethes when he broke into her room and tried to rape her. The Tyrant scoffs at this story. He tells her that he knows everything about her relationship with Tymethes and produces the stolen jewel as proof. Mazeres enters disguised as Roxano and recounts the details of The Young Queen's secret meeting with Tymethes at the lodge. The Young Queen is shocked at ""Roxano's"" betrayal. Comparing the Young Queen to a hunter who has killed a deer, the Tyrant orders his servants to butcher Tymethes' body and prepare it for a feast. He tells the Young Queen that she will be forced to eat her former lover as punishment for her deception. The Young Queen is distraught. The Tyrant exits. Mazeres enters and asks the Young Queen why she is upset. The Young Queen tells him that she has been betrayed by a servant. Mazeres asks her to name the traitorous servant so he can help her get revenge. At that moment, Roxano enters. The Young Queen identifies Roxano as the traitor. Mazeres rushes at Roxano with a sword and kills him. The Tyrant enters with servants carrying Tymethes' limbs. The limbs are strung up in the Young Queen's room. The Tyrant tells the Young Queen that she will receive nothing to eat until she has finished consuming Tymethes' remains. Scene 1: A room in the castle; Tymethes' butchered limbs hanging in display Zenarchus views Tymethes' butchered limbs and mourns bitterly. The Tyrant enters and asks Zenarchus if he is pleased that his villainous friend has been discovered and killed. Zenarchus coyly replies that he would be happier if Tymethes had been exposed sooner. He blames Mazeres for keeping Tymethes' crimes a secret rather than reporting them right away. Persuaded by his son's accusations, the Tyrant summons Mazeres and orders him executed. Mazeres is dragged off stage in astonishment. The Tyrant exits. Zenarchus expresses satisfaction that his friend's death has been avenged. Amphridote enters, shocked by the news of Mazeres' imminent execution (she pledged her love to Mazeres in 4.2). She vows to kill the person responsible for arranging Mazeres' death. Assuming that Amphridote will be pleased to hear that Tymethes' death has been avenged, Zenarchus tells her how he facilitated Mazeres' execution. He orders some wine for a toast. Amphridote secretly poisons the wine before it is poured. They both drink the poisoned wine. Amphridote tells her brother that she hates him for killing Mazeres and dies. Zenarchus says that women who fall in love to easily can never be virtuous. He dies as well. Thunder rumbles and lightning strikes. The Tyrant enters and says that the bad weather is not a good sign. He finds the bodies of his dead daughter and son, shrieks in horror, and orders his servants to take the corpses away. The Old King, Lapyrus, Sertorio and Lodovico enter, all disguised as pilgrims seeking refuge from the storm. They observe Tymethes' butchered limbs with horror and note that the castle is not well-guarded. The Tyrant greets the ""pilgrims"" warmly and orders his servants to bring dinner. A banquet is brought in, and a separate table is set aside for the Young Queen. The Tyrant encourages the ""pilgrims"" to ignore the butchered limbs strung up around them. The Young Queen enters and sits at her table. A plate of human flesh and a bloody skull are set in front of her. She eats the flesh and drinks blood out of the skull. The ""pilgrims"" are astounded. The Tyrant explains that the Young Queen is being forced to eat her former lover as punishment for her betrayal. Fidelo slips out of the room unnoticed. The Old King asks the name of the man being eaten. The Tyrant tells him that it is Tymethes, son of the Old King of Lydia. Fidelo re-enters and tells the Old King that the castle guards have been seized. The Old King begs the Tyrant to have mercy on the Young Queen. The Tyrant refuses: ""Never, our vow's irrevocable, never. The lecher must be swallowed rib by rib. His flesh is sweet; it melts, and goes down merrily."" At that moment, the pilgrims cast off their disguises and raise their swords. The Tyrant is shocked to see that Lapyrus has double-crossed him. Before he can be seized, the Tyrant kills the Young Queen and mocks his attackers. The Old King and company rush at the Tyrant with their swords. The Tyrant dies. The Old King is restored to his throne. The Old Queen enters, disguised as a humble nursemaid. The Old King asks her name, and she removes her disguise. The Old King rejoices and orders the burial of Tymethes' remains.",Normal
"J Force (sometimes referred to as ""Jayforce"") was the name given to the New Zealand forces that were allocated to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) which occupied Japan following the end of the Second World War. The force was deployed between 1946 and 1948, after which it was disbanded and its personnel repatriated to New Zealand. Upon the surrender of Japan which ended the combat phase of the Second World War, Allied Forces, including New Zealanders, Australians, Canadians, and Indians, entered Japan as an occupying force in February 1946 to restore the peace, clean up debris from the atomic blast, help rebuild and direct Japan into becoming a democratic society. Within a week of the surrender Britain invited New Zealand to participate in the occupation of Japan. Due to its weakened condition at the end of the war Britain lacked the resources to provide a force by itself and it wanted members of Commonwealth to help supply sufficient numbers to show the United States that it was still a major power. On 21 August 1945 the New Zealand government agreed to contribute both a land and an air contingent. The army contribution which consisted of both male and female members was made through a number of drafts. The initial contingent of the NZEF (Japan) was formed in Florence, Italy, on 19 November 1945. This was intended to provide the initial occupation force until a special occupation force could be created in New Zealand. Prime Minister Peter Fraser wanted the 5,000-strong contribution to be drawn from single male volunteers from the 2NZEF. However, its commander, Lieutenant-General Sir Bernard Freyberg, did not believe this would provide sufficient numbers. As a result, all single non-Maori men from the 13th, 14th and 15th Reinforcements were conscripted for the force. Volunteer officers, and specialists from earlier reinforcements as well as any Maori who wished to volunteer were allowed to make up the required numbers. As a result, a large number of this draft were very unhappy that after having survived the war they were going to Japan instead of home. The force of just over 4,000 men was built around the 9th Infantry Brigade Group, and was placed under the command of Brigadier K. L. Stewart, who was later replaced by Brigadier W. G. Gentry. The initial draft consisted of two infantry battalions—the 27th and 22nd Battalions—as well as the 2nd Divisional Cavalry Regiment, the 25th Field Battery, and the 5th Engineer Company along with supporting elements which included signals, transport, workshops and medical units. Among the first draft were 36 Women's Army Auxiliary Corps personnel (WAACs) and 30 women from the New Zealand Army Nursing Service (NZANS). All were volunteers. The Royal New Zealand Air Force had no problems filling the initial 24 flying positions and 250 support staff positions from over 1,500 applications. On 8 March 1946 the squadron complete with its aircraft departed New Zealand on the British aircraft carrier HMS Glory. Both the land and air force contributions arrived off the port of Kure on the Inland Sea of Japan in March 1946 in the company of HMNZS Achilles and HMNZS Hawera, which joined the Force from their stations in the Pacific where they had been serving during the Japanese surrender. In New Zealand service in Japan was more popular with applications from returned servicemen who were having trouble readjusting to civilian life as well as from young men and women who had missed out on wartime service and wanted adventure. Between May 1946 and August 1947 four relief drafts were dispatched from New Zealand to Japan. The relief drafts also featured women in the form of nurses, shorthand typists, hostesses and welfare staff. By the time the first New Zealand forces arrived in March 1946 United States military forces had already occupied most of Japan. The British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) was to be responsible for Hiroshima Prefecture as it contained a large port, Kure, and an adjacent airfield, Iwakuni. However, the zone of deployment was not big enough and so the area was extended to neighbouring prefectures. Within the BCOF J Force was responsible for the largely rural Yamaguchi Prefecture and Mishima Island, both in the south of Honshu. The initial draft encountered uncomfortable living conditions and poor food, which they compared unfavourably with what they had experienced in Italy. By the time the second relief draft arrived the quality of the accommodation and the supply of food had improved considerably. Because members of the BCOF were paid in pounds sterling whose exchange rate with the yen was set at an artificially low rate in an effort to slow inflation, this allowed members of the force to make money on the black market supplying Japanese with basic goods such as food and soap. Boredom was also initially a major problem, but as non-fraternisation rules were progressively relaxed high rates of venereal disease developed. J Force's first task was searching for and collecting military equipment. Little was found as Yamaguchi had not had a major military presence during the war. J Force also oversaw the repatriation of Japanese soldiers coming home from the war and Koreans being returned to their country. Post-war Japan was economically devastated which made it an ideal environment for black marketeering. As such, J Force's policing duties included monitoring black market groups and also large gatherings of people on public occasions and generally keeping order until civilian government could be re-established. J Force also assisted the Americans in promoting democracy in Japan by supervising local and national elections in the prefecture. For a period of a month J Force also provided a guard battalion to Tokyo. This was based at Ebisu Barracks and took part in ceremonial guard duty at the Imperial Palace and the British Embassy. The Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) reformed No. 14 Squadron RNZAF to provide its contribution. To outfit the squadron, the US provided Corsair FG-1D fighter aircraft, and extended its Lend-lease arrangement to cover the cost. The squadron was commanded by Squadron Leader Jesse de Willimoff, who was later succeeded by Squadron Leader D.F St George. Initially located in southern Honshu at the former Japanese naval air base at Iwakuni, the squadron undertook armed air patrols designed to protect armament and bomb dumps, identify locations of hidden ammunition, and check schoolyards for forbidden military parades. They also undertook surveillance flights over the seas between Japan and Korea to identify and turn back boats from smuggling Koreans into Japan. The squadron stayed in Japan for second year despite lacking a third of its ground staff due to the New Zealand Treasury Department refusing to fund recruiting advertisements. In February 1948, No.14 Squadron moved to Hōfu Air Field, where they replaced Royal Australian Air Force Mustangs. After the decision was made to withdraw J Force, twenty Corsairs were stacked together at one end of the airfield in October 1949 and set alight as the air force considered the aircraft to be at the end of their useful life and could not justify the expense of returning them to New Zealand. The only casualty during the deployment was Flight Lieutenant C. W. N Wright who was killed when his aircraft crashed on takeoff. Personnel departed Japan on 25 November 1948 on MV Westralia. Flying Dakota transport aircraft, the RNZAF's No. 41 (Transport) Squadron provided the link between New Zealand and Japan for J Force. Operating over one of the longest air transport routes in the world, the squadron operated between February 1946 and April 1948. Once a week a Dakota departed on the 20,000km return flight between Whenuapai and Iwakuni carrying supplies and personnel between the two destinations. When Great Britain and India withdrew from the BCOF in 1947 enthusiasm for New Zealand’s ongoing involvement waned. In April 1948 the New Zealand government made the decision to withdraw from Japan. The last New Zealand J Force troops returned home in September 1948. In total approximately 12,000 New Zealanders served in Japan during the occupation, while 15 members were killed in accidents or died of illness. They are buried in the Commonwealth cemetery at Yokohama. Some New Zealand personnel would later return to Japan on R&R during the Korean War (1950–1953). Once back in New Zealand J Force personnel found they were treated differently from World War II veterans. Their service went unrecognised and until 1964 they were not eligible to join the RSA or receive war pensions. It was not until 1995 that the New Zealand Service Medal 1946–1949 was instituted to recognise the service of J Force veterans in Japan. J Force 9th Brigade Support Units RNZAF",Normal

"David Corbett is a Canadian lawyer who gained international acclaim when, in 2002, he argued Marc Hall v. Durham Catholic School Board, a case that pitted the rights of a homosexual couple against the rights of a religious institution. Prior to the case Mr. Corbett was a well known gay activist in Ontario arguing numerous cases and publishing many articles for same-sex equality. When the Marc Hall case garnered international attention, Mr. Corbett agreed to take the case pro bono (free of charge). In 2003, Mr. Corbett was appointed to the Ontario Superior Court. In 1985, Justice David Corbett received a Bachelor of Laws from Osgoode Hall Law School. Then joined the Law Society of Upper Canada in 1987. Prior to being appointed Superior Court Justice he was a partner at Eberts Symes Street Corbett & Pinto where he specialized in the area of civil litigation. He had previously held positions with the Osgoode Hall Law School, the University of Toronto, and the University of Western Ontario. Mr Justice Corbett was also a director of Foundation for Equal Families. Marc Hall was a high school student at Oshawa, Ontario's Monsignor John Pereyma Catholic Secondary School who wanted to take his boyfriend to his high school prom in 2002. The case was notable because it pitted the rights of gays and lesbians against the rights of religious institutions. According to BNA Act (1867), S.93 Catholic schools in Ontario were guaranteed special protections to operate according to their religious beliefs free of governmental interference. This, the school district argued, protected the school's right to deny Mr. Hall from taking his boyfriend to the school prom, an act the Catholic Church would consider a sin. Mr Corbett argued that the school, which received public funding, was obligated to obey laws outlawing discrimination, including the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Mr Corbett succeeded in winning an injunction against the school that forced it not only to allow Mr Hall to take his boyfriend but forbade the school from cancelling the event. The injunction did not, however, make any final ruling outside of this particular case in regards to the role of religious freedoms as they relate to the rights of same-sex couples. In 2005, 2 years after David Corbett was appointed Canadian Superior Justice, Mr Hall dropped his pending court case. Director Larry Peloso created a one-hour documentary on the case entitled Prom Fight: The Marc Hall Story. An unrelated television movie, Prom Queen: The Marc Hall Story, aired on CTV in 2004. Aaron Ashmore starred as Hall.",Normal

"Judith Sargentini (born 13 March 1974) is a former Dutch politician and Member of the European Parliament (MEP). She is a member of the GreenLeft (Dutch: GroenLinks) party, which is part of The Greens–European Free Alliance, and the European Green Party. Previously, she was chair of the party's delegation in Amsterdam's city council. Of distant Italian descent from Bozzano, Province of Lucca, Tuscany, on her paternal side, Sargentini describes her family as being ""politically very aware"". As a child, her parents took her to demonstrations against the placement of nuclear weapons in the Netherlands. Between 1986 and 1992, she attended high school at the Spinozalyceum in Amsterdam. In 1999 she received an MA of history at the University of Amsterdam (specialising in totalitarian systems and the democratisation of Europe). Since 1990, Sargentini was politically active, first in the PSJG, the political youth organization of the left-socialist Pacifist Socialist Party, and later in DWARS, the political youth organization of the GreenLeft, a new political party in which the PSP had merged. During her study, she was also active in the international student movement. Sargentini is a vegetarian. She was secretary of the Dutch Student Union (between 1995 and 1996) and board member of the European Students' Union (in 1998). In 2002, Sargentini was elected into the Amsterdam municipal council. Between 1999 and 2002, she sat as a co-opted assistant on the municipal council. Between 2006 and 2009, Sargentini served as chair of the GreenLeft party in the Amsterdam municipality. She was spokesperson on work & income, youth policy, and public order. In addition to her membership of the council, Sargentini worked for various NGOs in the sphere development cooperation. Between 2000 and 2001, she was international coordinator of the European Network for Information and Action in Southern Africa. Following upon that, she worked as international-campaign coordinator for Fatal Transactions, a foundation that highlighted issues surrounding the international trade in conflict diamonds and the financing of (civil) wars in Africa. Between 2003 and 2007, she worked as lobbyist at the Dutch Institute for South Africa. Since 2007, she worked as consultant for the European alliance of development-cooperation organisations Eurostep. In 2009, Sargentini was one of the candidates for the position of lead candidate on the list of GroenLinks for the 2009 European Parliament elections. While a candidate for the position, Sargentini emphasised issues such as development cooperation, migration, climate change and emancipation. On 8 February 2009, it was announced that she was elected as lead candidate and party foreperson for GroenLinks in the Netherlands European Parliament elections. After five rounds of vote counting, she was elected with 52.4% of the tally. In 2009, she urged the international community to start negotiations with the Palestinian Hamas and condemned Israel for its ""disproportionate use of power"". In 2015, she visited Israel and Palestine, characterising Israel with the word apartheid. In 2018 she accused Israel of war crimes for forcibly deporting the Palestinians. In 2015 she said that claiming that Islamic State warriors are coming into Europe with refugees is hysteria. In a video her efforts were praised by the Hamas. She herself and the political stance of her party was criticised by the chief rabbi of the Netherlands in a demonstration outside of the office of the Green party in Utrecht. Binyomin Jacobs claimed that Sargentini's opinion encouraged antisemitism. Sargentini became a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs of the European Parliament, as well as a substitute for the Committee on Development. In addition to her committee assignments, Sargentini is a member of the European Parliament Intergroup on LGBT Rights. She is also a vice-chairwoman of the cross-party working groups on fair trade (sponsored by Fair Trade Advocacy), as well as on innovation, access to medicines, and poverty-related diseases (sponsored by Médecins Sans Frontières). In the European parliament, Sargentini serves as rapporteur on conflict minerals. In 2014, she and Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš persuaded their fellow MEPs to back new rules under which public registers are created listing the beneficial owners of all EU companies and trusts. From 2014 until 2019, Sargentini was a member of the Democracy Support and Election Coordination Group (DEG), which oversees the Parliament's election observation missions. She has led EU-Election Observer Missions on numerous occasions, including for the 2014 Tunisian parliamentary elections and the 2015 Tanzanian general elections. In 2017, she was appointed by the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs as the rapporteur to examine triggering Article 7 proceedings against Hungary alleging breaches of ""core EU values"". On 12 September 2018 the European Parliament adopted a resolution based on her report to trigger Article 7. The report includes concerns mainly regarding the constitutional and electoral system; the independence of the judiciary’, corruption; privacy and data protection; freedom of expression; academic independence; freedom of religion and association; the right to equal treatment; the rights of minorities, migrants, asylum seekers and refugees; and the abolition of economic and social rights, antisemitism, antisemitic acts and hate speech. In point 57 of her report she accused the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán of delivering antisemitic hate speech. In point 67, she claimed that the conviction of Ahmed H-, a Syrian refugee, who got into conflict with Hungarian policemen at the southern border, raises ""the issue of proper application of the laws against terrorism in Hungary, as well as the right to a fair trial"". The report was approved by the European Parliament, with 448 votes in favour, 197 against and 48 abstention. The Hungarian Government questioned the legitimacy of this vote, claiming that this kind of decision would have needed a 23 majority. The Orbán-cabinet also stated that the abstinence votes should not have been omitted during the voting process - ignoring that only votes cast, excluding abstentions, were counted on the advice of the Parliament's legal service. Hungary turned to the European Court of Justice for a final decision. The government also edited a 109 pages long answer, which claims that the report contains at least 39 factual errors or fallacies. Ms Sargentini replied to this answer at a press conference, stating that she went through it and found ""no holes in  report since it is based on sources of intergovernmental bodies such as the UN, the Council of Europe, court cases from Strasbourg and Luxembourg, infringement procedures"", adding that the report does not express her personal opinion but that of the European Commission. The dean of the Hungarian university ELTE claimed that contrarily to what Ms Sargentini said, the university had not been consulted during Ms Sargentini's investigation, and asked the removal of its name from the report many times- without response. Another Hungarian university, the University of Pécs also raised this concern. On this issue, Ms Sargentini answered that names were omitted on the interviewed academics' request, who feared of being outed as they would be labelled anti-government and pursued for their opinions. The leaders of the Hungarian Jewish community said that contrarily to what Sargentini stated, antisemitism is actually in decline in Hungary, which is a safer place for Jewry than many West-European countries, due to the government's actions and to the lack of muslim population. Chief Rabbi, Slomó Köves declared that the Sargentini Report is misleading and unfounded concerning Hungarian antisemitism. Following her report, Sargentini became the subject of a negative TV campaign financed by the Hungarian government. Deserted by many of his conservative allies, the membership of the Hungarian governing party Fidesz was partially suspended by the European People's Party on 20 March 2019.",Normal

"John MacDonald Falconar Grant, AO, OBE (14 August 1922 – 10 November 2013) was an Australian neurosurgeon and disability sport administrator. He was president of the 2000 Sydney Paralympic Games Organising Committee. He played a leading role in the development of disability sport in Australia. Grant was born on 14 August 1922 in Sydney. His parents were Chesborough Grant Falconar Grant and Henrietaa Thelma Leary. In 1945, he married Enid Llewlyn at St John's, Ashfield. They had three children: Stuart, Mandy, and Catherine. Grant was put on the Worker's Party New South Wales Senate ticket at the 1975 Australian federal election due to a misunderstanding with John Singleton and asked to be removed; he was left on the ballot but was not elected. His autobiography Different Theatres: From Neurosurgery to Sport for People with disabilities, published in 2005, provides insight into his work on medical and disability sport. Grant attended Roseville Public School, Chatswood Intermediate School and North Sydney Boys High School. In 1945, he graduated from the University of Sydney with a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery with Second Class Honours. Further education included a Master of Surgery of the University of Sydney, Fellowship of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, Fellowship of the American College of Surgeons, and a Fellowship of the Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine in the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. Grant was a resident medical officer at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney where he undertook specialist training in general surgery and orthopaedic surgery followed by intensive training in neurosurgery. In 1952, he was appointed to Royal North Shore Hospital where he helped to establish its Department of Neurosurgery and Spinal Injuries Unit. He provided neurosurgical consultations to several acute hospitals in New South Wales, as well as the rehabilitation programs at Mt Wilga Rehabilitation Centre and the Spastic Centre of New South Wales. He retired from operative surgery in 2002. Grant's interest in the role of sport in the rehabilitation for people with spinal injuries can be linked to the work of Sir Ludwig Guttman, neurologist from Stoke Mandeville Hospital. In 1957, he visited the hospital and observed the role of sport in rehabilitation. In 1958, he played a major role in organising the First Royal North Shore Hospital Games for spinal injury patients. The Games were held at the Gore Hill Oval near the hospital. Grant also played a role in including sports in rehabilitation programs at Mount Wilga House. It held annual Sports Days. The Australian Team to the 1960 Rome Paralympics included eight competitors who had been patients at Mt Wilga Rehabilitation Centre and trained by Kevin Betts and Eileen Perrottet. In 1961, he co-founded with Jack Ferguson the Paraplegic and Quadriplegic Association of New South Wales. He was president from 1968 to 2000. While President of this Association, he was instrumental in establishing the Junior National Wheelchair Games. He was the Medical Officer and Team Manager of the Australian teams that competed at the 1966 and 1970 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games. Grant and compatriate Graham Pryke were founding members of the FESPIC Games. In 1977, he was Chairman of the Organising Committee for the 2nd FESPIC Games held in Sydney. In 1980, he wrote to the Minister for Sport, Bob Ellicott, stating the case for a national policy on sport for people with disabilities. Subsequently, the Australian Government established a national advisory committee on sports for disabled persons he was a member of. In 1993, he was the Chairman of the Sydney Bid Committee for the 2000 Paralympic Games. The successful bid led to Grant becoming President of the Sydney Paralympic Games Organising Committee 1994–2000. Grant held leadership positions with several international disability sports organisations: President of International Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Sports Federation, Chairman of the International Co-ordinating Committee of World Sports for the Disabled, and Member of the International Paralympic Committee.",Normal

"George Fleming Houston (January 11, 1896 – November 12, 1944) was an American B-western film actor and accomplished singer in the early half of the 20th century. Born and raised in Hampton, New Jersey, his parents were Reverend Thomas Houston, a blind evangelist, and Mrs. Charles Houston. He attended Blair Academy, in New Jersey, where he ran track, then later he attended the Institute of Musical Arts, the original name for what would eventually become Juilliard School. Houston received two degrees, one in voice, and one for teaching music. Houston joined the U.S. Army, serving in France during World War I, attached to the 17th French Division, in the Ambulance Service. His military service ran from June 5, 1917, to April 12, 1919. In 1923 he began studying at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester. Houston garnered leading bass roles in such operas as Boris Godunov and Faust under the direction of Vladimir Rosing. Members of Rosing's opera department soon spun off into the American Opera Company, touring the United States and Canada successfully for several years until the Depression grounded the promising venture in 1930. Highlights for Houston included a performance of Carmen with guest artist Mary Garden, a season at the Guild Theater on Broadway and a performance for President Coolidge in Washington, D.C., in December 1927. Houston's Broadway credits included The O'Flynn (1934), Caviar (1934), Shooting Star (1933), Melody (1933), A Modern Virgin (1931), The Venetian Glass Nephew (1931), Fioretta (1929), and Chee-Chee (1928). After doing some stage acting on Broadway, Houston was enticed to try his acting skills in Hollywood by the early 1930s, hoping to win parts in singing films. He received small bit parts in six different films, but no roles that cast him in a starring role. After his sixth, he found himself unemployed. On September 8, 1933, in New York City, Houston married Leone Sousa, a model and Ziegfeld girl. They later moved to Los Angeles, California. In 1936, Houston and Sousa performed together in the play Everyman, produced by the California Festival Association at the Hollywood Bowl and directed by Max Reinhardt. Houston was cast as Mephisto in another lavish Max Reinhardt production of Faust at the Pilgrimage Theatre in Hollywood in 1938. In 1935, Houston was noticed by small production company Grand National Pictures, who hired him to play the lead role in a series of musical westerns including the 1936 film Captain Calamity and the 1938 film Frontier Scout. The 1938 film was successful and brought Houston to the notice of other production companies. That same year he would play a small role in Blockade with Henry Fonda and Madeleine Carroll, in which he was billed as ""George Byron"". In MGM's movie The Great Waltz, also released in 1938, he played the opera singer Fritz Schiller. On February 21, 1940, Houston and Sousa divorced, after having parted on November 1, 1939. Sousa spoke about Houston in court: ""He paid practically no attention to me. He'd go out socially without me and he wouldn't return until some time between 2 and 5 o'clock in the morning.  He was always having bills for champagne sent to our home. But I never saw the champagne."" Sousa was awarded the divorce decree and Houston was made to pay her $200 a month in alimony until one of them died or Sousa remarried. Houston later married opera singer Virginia Card, who he stayed with until his death. By 1940, following several failed film endeavors, Grand National Pictures was in trouble, and they went out of business soon after. Houston had been billed prior to this time by a new company, Producers Releasing Corporation, as the future character of Billy the Kid in an eight film series for that company. However, when it came time to film the series, Bob Steele was cast in the role for six episodes, and was replaced by Buster Crabbe following Steele's departure to Republic Pictures. Despite his not being cast in the ""Billy the Kid"" role, PRC gave Houston his own series of films. He would make eleven films as ""The Lone Rider"", beginning with the 1941 film The Lone Rider Rides On, in which he sang the theme song in an equally rousing bass-baritone voice at the beginning and end. Al ""Fuzzy"" St. John played his sidekick in all eleven films. However, by the end of 1942, Houston was replaced by veteran actor Bob Livingston as the ""Lone Rider."" St. John and actor Dennis Moore would remain with the series. Houston planned to return to his singing interests, but died unexpectedly on November 12, 1944. After a rehearsal of a film, Houston had a few drinks and collapsed from a heart attack. The police, thinking he was drunk, deposited him in the drunk tank. He then died either in the drunk tank or on the way to hospital. His wife, Virginia Card, was at the time starring in the Broadway hit Oklahoma!, which had just debuted in 1943. Houston was, at the time of his death, preparing to take his opera company on a nationwide tour. George Houston was beloved as a voice teacher and coach by Howard Keel and John Raitt. Keel wrote in his autobiography Only Make Believe that Houston was ""...like a father to me."", and described his death. The ""Lone Rider"" films:",Normal
"United States v. Ivanov was an American court case addressing subject-matter jurisdiction for computer crimes performed by Internet users outside of the United States against American businesses and infrastructure. In trial court, Aleksey Vladimirovich Ivanov of Chelyabinsk, Russia was indicted for conspiracy, computer fraud, extortion, and possession of illegal access devices; all crimes committed against the Online Information Bureau (OIB) whose business and infrastructure were based in Vernon, Connecticut. Ivanov moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing that ""because he was physically located in Russia when the offenses were committed, he can not be charged with violations of United States law."" The court denied Ivanov's motion, ""first, because the intended and actual detrimental effects of Ivanov's actions in Russia occurred within the United States, and second, because each of the statutes under which Ivanov was charged with a substantive offense was intended by Congress to apply extraterritorially."" In a later ruling, Ivanov pleaded guilty to several crimes, including computer intrusion and computer fraud, and was sentenced to 48 months in prison followed by 3 months of supervised release. Ivanov attracted FBI attention in the Fall of 1999, when internet service provider (ISP) Speakeasy discovered their network had been compromised and informed the Seattle branch of the FBI. In early 2000, OIB also detected an attack and notified the FBI in Connecticut. Between late 1999 and early 2000, other large Internet corporations including CD Universe, Yahoo, and eBay also experienced similar attacks to Speakeasy and OIB. Computer forensics determined the Internet traffic for all attacks originated from the same machine in Russia. After linking his online alias ""subbsta"" and his resume, the FBI determined Ivanov's identity and initiated a sting operation to lure him to the United States for arrest. The FBI constructed a false computer security company, Invita, in Seattle, Washington and invited Ivanov to interview for a position on November 10, 2000. Ivanov's interview involved hacking an FBI controlled honeypot. While Ivanov was hacking the FBI honeypot, all keystrokes and network traffic were recorded as potential evidence. In addition, the FBI made video and audio recordings of the entire interview process. After Ivanov successfully gained access to the FBI honeypot, he was arrested. The FBI used the recorded keystrokes and network traffic log to access the intermediary computers Ivanov used in Russia. When the FBI accessed Ivanov's machines, they found folders with data corresponding to the companies he had remotely attacked. Over 2.3 GB of data was recovered from Ivanov's machines, including the tools used to gain illegal access and scripts that referenced companies that had been attacked. Ivanov obtained superuser (root) access to OIB machines. By gaining root access to OIB's machines, Ivanov was effectively able to ""control the data, e.g. credit card numbers and merchant account numbers, stored in OIB computers."" After gaining access to OIB's systems, Ivanov contacted OIB using his online handle ""subbsta"", offering security assistance in exchange for $10,000. OIB refused to pay Ivanov which resulted in a final email: ""now imagine please Somebody hack you network (and not notify you about this), he downloaded Atomic software with more than 300 merchants, transfer money, and after this did 'rm –rf' and after this you company be ruined. I don't want this, and because this I notify you about possible hack in you network, if you want you can hire me and im always check security in you network. What you think about this."" When brought to trial in Connecticut, Ivanov was indicted on eight counts, six of which Ivanov appealed: Ivanov was subject to up to ninety years in prison if found guilty on all counts. After his indictment, Ivanov filed for a motion to dismiss all charges because ""he was physically located in Russia when the offenses were committed"" and thus ""he can not be charged with violations of United States law."" The district court denied his appeal following two trains of logic: ""first, because the intended and actual detrimental effects of Ivanov's actions in Russia occurred within the United States, and second, because each of the statutes under which Ivanov was charged with a substantive offense was intended by congress to apply extraterritorially."" The court argued that previous cases provided precedent for applying subject matter jurisdiction extraterritorially, so long as the ""intended and detrimental effects"" occurred within jurisdiction. The court cited United States v. Muench as stating, ""the intent to cause effects within the United States... makes it reasonable to apply to persons outside United States territory a statute which is not expressly extraterritorial in scope."" The court also cited United States v. Steinberg in claiming, ""it has long been a commonplace of criminal liability that a person may be charged in the place where the evil results, even though he is beyond the jurisdiction where he starts the train of events of which the evil is the fruit."" The court then argued that the detrimental effects of Ivanov's attacks indeed took place in the United States, stating, ""the fact the computers were accessed by means of a complex process initiated and controlled from a remote location does not alter the fact that the accessing of the computers, i.e, part of the detrimental effect prohibited by the statute, occurred at the place where the computers were physically located, namely OIB's place of business in Vernon, Connecticut."" In a second argument, the court stated that regardless of the previous logic, ""to each of the statutes under which the defendant has been indicted for a substantive offense, there is clear evidence that the statute was intended to apply extraterritorially."" The court then enumerated each of Ivanov's alleged offenses, the laws they referenced, and the specific language in the laws that implied extraterritorial application. Following these arguments, the court denied Ivanov's motion to dismiss. Ivanov later pleaded guilty to several of the charges, including computer intrusion and computer fraud, and was sentenced to 48 months in prison followed by 3 months of supervised release. Ivanov's crimes were not limited to Connecticut. He was also prosecuted and convicted in Washington, New Jersey, and California for similar crimes. In total, Ivanov was tried in five district courts, more than any other case listed on the United States Department of Justice listing of computer crimes. Although the court ruled that the laws which Ivanov violated already extended extraterritorially, the USA PATRIOT Act increased the scope of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to expressly cover machines outside the United States.",Normal

"In computer science, adaptive heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm of the adaptive sort family. It is a variant of heap sort that performs better when the data contains existing order. Published by Christos Levcopoulos and Ola Petersson in 1992, the algorithm utilizes a new measure of presortedness, Osc, as the number of oscillations. Instead of putting all the data into the heap as the traditional heap sort did, adaptive heap sort only take part of the data into the heap so that the run time will reduce significantly when the presortedness of the data is high. Heap sort is a sorting algorithm that utilizes binary heap data structure. The method treats an array as a complete binary tree and builds up a Max-HeapMin-Heap to achieve sorting. It usually involves the following four steps. Below is a CC++ implementation that builds up a Max-Heap and sorts the array after the heap is built. Measures of presortedness measures the existing order in a given sequence. These measures of presortedness decides the number of data that will be put in to the heap during the sorting process as well as the lower bound of running time. For sequence X = ⟨ x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , … , x n ⟩ {displaystyle X=langle x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},dots ,x_{n}rangle } , Cross(xi) is defined as the number edges of the line plot of X that are intersected by a horizontal line through the point (i, xi). Mathematically, it is defined as C r o s s ( x i ) = { j ∣ min { x j , x j + 1 } < x i < max { x j , x j + 1 } for 1 ≤ j < n } , for 1 ≤ i ≤ n {displaystyle {mathit {Cross}}(x_{i})={jmid min{x_{j},x_{j+1}}<x_{i}<max{x_{j},x_{j+1}}{text{ for }}1leq j<n}{text{, for }}1leq ileq n} . The oscillation(Osc) of X is just the total number of intersections, defined as O s c ( x ) = ∑ i = 1 n ‖ C r o s s ( x i ) ‖ {displaystyle {mathit {Osc}}(x)=textstyle sum _{i=1}^{n}displaystyle lVert {mathit {Cross}}(x_{i})rVert } . Besides the original Osc measurement, other known measures include the number of inversions Inv, the number of runs Runs, the number of blocks Block, and the measures Max, Exc and Rem. Most of these different measurements are related for adaptive heap sort. Some measures dominate the others: every Osc-optimal algorithm is Inv optimal and Runs optimal; every Inv-optimal algorithm is Max optimal; and every Block-optimal algorithm is Exc optimal and Rem optimal. Adaptive heap sort is a variant of heap sort that seeks optimality (asymptotically optimal) with respect to the lower bound derived with the measure of presortedness by taking advantage of the existing order in the data. In heap sort, for a data X = ⟨ x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , … , x n ⟩ {displaystyle X=langle x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},dots ,x_{n}rangle } , we put all n elements into the heap and then keep extracting the maximum (or minimum) for n times. Since the time of each max-extraction action is the logarithmic in the size of the heap, the total running time of standard heap sort is O ( n log ⁡ n ) {displaystyle color {Blue}O(nlog n)} . For adaptive heap sort, instead of putting all the elements into the heap, only the possible maximums of the data (max-candidates) will be put into the heap so that fewer runs are required when each time we try to locate the maximum (or minimum). First, a Cartesian tree is built from the input in O ( n ) {displaystyle O(n)} time by putting the data into a binary tree and making each node in the tree is greater(or smaller) than all its children nodes, and the root of the Cartesian tree is inserted into an empty binary heap. Then repeatedly extract the maximum from the binary heap, retrieve the maximum in the Cartesian tree, and add its left and right children (if any) which are themselves Cartesian trees, to the binary heap. If the input is already nearly sorted, the Cartesian trees will be very unbalanced, with few nodes having left and right children, resulting in the binary heap remaining small, and allowing the algorithm to sort more quickly than O ( n log ⁡ n ) {displaystyle O(nlog n)} for inputs that are already nearly sorted. Below is an implementation in pseudo-code: Despite decades of research, there's still a gap between the theory of adaptive heap sort and its practical use. Because the algorithm makes use of Cartesian trees and pointer manipulation, it has low cache-efficiency and high memory requirements, both of which deteriorate the performance of implementations.",Normal

"Jean Gertrude ""True"" Davidson, CM (19 April 1901 – 18 September 1978), was a Canadian politician, teacher, and writer. She was the first mayor of the Borough of East York, Ontario, and she was one of Metropolitan Toronto's most colourful politicians in a career spanning nearly 25 years. She spent 10 years on the East York school board and 11 years as alderwoman, reeve and mayor on East York Council. During her time in municipal politics she ran in 11 elections and never lost. She was born in Hudson, Quebec, the daughter of a Methodist minister. She was educated at the University of Toronto and then worked as a teacher. She worked as a writer, editing a 12-volume compendium of Canadiana by William Perkins Bull. After her parents died, she moved to East York where she quickly became involved in local politics. She became a school trustee in 1947 and later chair of the school board. In 1958 she ran for local council and served one term before being elected as reeve in 1960. In 1966, East York merged with Leaside and Davidson emerged as the winner in a runoff election for mayor against Leaside's reeve, Beth Nealson. Davidson stayed on as mayor for six years until she retired in 1972. Davidson was inspired to join the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in the 1930s after meeting J.S. Woodsworth. She ran twice as a candidate for the party losing both times. She left the party after the CCF merged with the Canadian Labour Congress to form the New Democratic Party of Canada. In 1971 she ran for the Liberals in the 1971 provincial election but lost to incumbent Arthur Meen. In the last six years of her life she concentrated on writing a twice weekly column for the Toronto Sun and also focused her efforts on environmental conservation. She died in 1978 at the age of 77. Davidson was born in Hudson, Quebec, in 1901. Her father, John Wilson Davidson was a Methodist minister. Her mother, Mary Elfeda Pomeroy, was the daughter of a Methodist minister. She had a younger sister named Marsh. At the time of her death she had two nephews, Michael and David Cobden. In 1917, she attended Victoria College (now part of the University of Toronto) when it was still in Cobourg, Ontario, starting at the age of 16. She earned her BA there and then went to the Regina Normal School where she obtained a teaching certificate. She taught English and History in Strasbourg, Saskatchewan and Brandon, Manitoba. In 1923, she returned to university and received her M.A. After that she taught history at Havergal College in Toronto. Davidson wrote children's books and for a time worked for textbook publisher J.M. Dent and Sons as a salesperson, visiting school boards across the country. She was the first female publishing sales representative in Canada. Leaving J.M. Dent in 1930, Davidson spent a year attempting to survive as a writer. During this time she wrote articles for The Globe and Mail and Chatelaine magazine. In 1931 she was hired by William Perkins Bull to coordinate the publication of a 12-volume edition of Canadiana. She worked on the project for seven years. By the time it was completed she was in charge of a staff of 70 researchers. In 1940, she moved with her parents to Streetsville, Ontario. During the move she was in a motor vehicle accident that left her father seriously injured. He died four days later. Left destitute and caring for her invalid mother, she performed odd writing jobs until in April 1941, she was appointed Clerk and Treasurer of the Village of Streetsville. She was replacing someone who had gone overseas to fight in World War II. Davidson joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in 1934 after meeting J.S. Woodsworth. She remarked about him, ""He had a burning fire of love for people. You could warm your hands in his personality."" She worked for Agnes MacPhail and Arthur Williams on their election campaigns in the 1930s. She ran for the CCF in the 1953 federal election in the riding of York East coming third behind Robert McGregor. She also ran provincially in the 1955 Ontario election against Hollis Beckett, again with a poor showing. In 1971 she recalled this period of involvement with the CCF. She said, ""I'm not a partisan politician at all... I ran for the CCF 15 or 16 years ago when the CCF had fallen on very stony places. I don't know why I ran. I had no thought of winning."" She became concerned with the direction of the party, especially after the disastrous results of the 1951 provincial election. She felt that the party was moving away from grassroots volunteers who discussed social issues with voters and was more concerned with fundraising and member recruitment. In 1952 she helped form a committee with Bill Temple, Mary Ramsay and Avis McCurdy, called the ""Ginger Group"". The committee met prior to the CCF provincial convention to discuss party issues. They resolved to try and nominate Bill Temple as leader against Ted Jolliffe. At the convention Temple withdrew at the last minute, allowing Jolliffe to be acclaimed. Davidson and Temple were subsequently elected to the executive as vice-presidents. In 1954 Davidson walked out of a party conference that called for parties in municipal politics. She felt that party politics should stay out of local councils. After that she became more involved in local politics and drifted away from the party. When the CCF merged with the Canadian Labour Congress in 1961 to form the New Democratic Party (NDP), she refused to join due to its partnership with the unions. She said, ""I never joined the NDP. I didn't like the NDP from the beginning. I came to believe that socialism wouldn't cure the ills of the world. I couldn't see it."" Davidson moved to East York in 1947 after the death of her mother. Shortly after moving she was diagnosed with cancer at Princess Margaret Hospital. Feeling that she had not much time left Davidson immersed herself in community issues. It turned out that the cancer diagnosis was incorrect but she continued her involvement. She established a neighbourhood kindergarten which led to her being elected as a school trustee in 1948. In 1952 she became the first woman to chair the East York Board of Education. In 1958, she was elected to East York's town council. In 1960 she ran for the position of Reeve of the Township of East York against incumbent Jack Allen. The main issue at the time was uncontrolled development on land bordering the Don Valley beside Bayview Avenue. The development, later dubbed the Bayview Ghost, was a rallying cry for her campaign. She beat Allen by 5,065 votes to 3,458. Davidson was a dedicated politician, often attending community meetings, up to 40 per month. She was also a formidable debater, with an abrupt and abrasive style that annoyed her fellow council members. Yet the voters loved her and she was re-elected six times. In 1966, East York was amalgamated with the Town of Leaside, and Davidson found herself pitted against Leaside mayor Beth Nealson in an election dubbed the ""Battle of the Belles"" to become the first mayor of the newly amalgamated Borough of East York. “If you want someone beautiful and elegant, or glamorous, I'm not that”, Davidson said during the campaign. Despite spending the final days of the campaign in a hospital recovering from a heart attack, she won the election handily. After amalgamation, Davidson was still mindful of local sentiment towards the neighbourhood name of Leaside, and, while not making it official, insisted that the name 'Leaside' be retained for any public building or space. As mayor of East York, she sought to unite the new community by starting a centennial project. Her goal was the restoration of Todmorden Mills as a heritage museum. Despite mounting costs she reached her goal by raising funds through centennial grants and from private donations. The museum was opened on 22 May 1967. She remained an honorary curator until her death. Davidson also started and served as the first director of the East York Foundation in 1966, which was created with a goal of preserving cultural holdings and artifacts. Another of Davidson's lasting achievements was the founding of the ""East York Dominion Day Parade"". The 1 July celebration was first started in 1957 even before she joined the council in 1958. The parade is a local tradition, and even in post-amalgamation Toronto, it continues to be held annually. Davidson had a reputation for never mincing words. She would always say what was on her mind. When she ran for reeve in 1960 she called one of her opponents, Leslie Saunders, ""bigoted, pigheaded and, in his attitude to women, a throwback to the stone age"". During the East York mayoralty race in 1966 she called Beth Nealson a ""wish-washy, prissy, sweetheart"". Metro chairman Fred Gardiner once complained that she had ""taken a yard"" off his back. Davidson replied that he still had plenty of hide left to spare. She referred to Metro chairman Albert Campbell as a ""maundering chairman, inclined to regard other councillors as grade one dunces ruled by himself as schoolmaster."" In one exchange with Campbell, she retorted ""Don't be addled man. Don't talk stupid!"" Nevertheless, she had her supporters. Fellow Metro councillor, Bill Kilbourn spoke fondly of her. ""Decent, fearless, independent. True was a thorn in the flesh of the smooth men at Metro (council)."" In 1971 during her last term as mayor she made the surprising announcement that she wished to run as a Liberal in the next provincial election. She was nominated as the Liberal candidate in the riding of York East. She said she ran because she was frustrated by the way the Conservative government was treating municipalities. She said ""The municipalities can't go on taking more and more responsibilities and having less and less resources given them by a provincial government which is as whimsical as a 15-year-old girl with her first beau."" During the election campaign she received a lot of press coverage but it focused on her age (then 70) and a certain perceived parochial attitude. Her small town persona carried well in the municipal world, but did not translate well to provincial politics. She lost badly to the Conservative incumbent Arthur Meen. Davidson retired from politics in 1972. She continued to remain involved by writing a twice-weekly column on local affairs for the Toronto Sun. She also wrote occasionally for the Toronto Star and provided commentaries for CBC Radio.In 1973 she published a book called The Golden Strings. Many had expected this to be an autobiography but instead she wrote about people whose lives had inspired her. One of the activities she focused on was her interest in environmentalism. She continued to serve as a member of the Metro Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA). As reeve, one of her first acts had been to donate 245 acres (99ha) of land in the Don Valley to the TRCA, because she said that the borough did not have the funds to properly manage it. She stated her environmental beliefs as, ""...prudent ecological management which the wise and far-seeing tell us is absolutely necessary for the future of the race."" Davidson used some of her free time to travel to Europe and Australia. On one of her trips she had an accidental fall and an x-ray revealed a cancerous growth. She was diagnosed with cancer and died at Toronto East General Hospital on 18 September 1978. When Davidson retired from East York politics the borough named a senior's residence after her, the True Davidson Acres. In 1971 she was awarded an honorary doctorate from Victoria College as a Doctor of Sacred Letters. Davidson was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1973, received the Queen's Jubilee Medal in 1977 and, just before her death in 1978, was awarded an honorary doctorate from York University, where she had recently enrolled as a doctoral student in Canadian literature. After her death, the ""True Davidson Collection of Canadian Literature"" was established at York University, based on a donation of her personal papers. In 1997, just before amalgamation, one of the last acts of the East York Council was to rename the meeting place as the True Davidson Council Chamber. In the late 1990s, a new residential development was built on the same lands as the Bayview Ghost. In 1999 the East York Community Council named one of the new streets of the development ""True Davidson Drive"" in honour of her impact on the area. In 2001, the city designated her former residence at 203 Woodmount Avenue as ""True Davidson House"". Her first house in East York was on Linsmore Crescent but she had moved to Woodmount Avenue and spent the majority of her time here. The local Meals on Wheels agency is named for her, as is a park near Coxwell Avenue and Cosburn Avenue.",Normal
"James John Clyde, Baron Clyde, PC (29 January 1932 – 6 March 2009) was a Scottish judge. James John Clyde was born in Edinburgh on 29 January 1932 the only son and youngest child of Margaret Letitia (1901–1974), (daughter of Arthur Edmund DuBuisson), and James Latham McDiarmid Clyde, (later Lord Clyde (1898–1975). He is grandson of James Avon Clyde, Lord Clyde. He attended Edinburgh Academy. In 1954 he graduated with a BA Literae Humaniores from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and from the University of Edinburgh, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws in 1959.

"Cannabis consumption refers to the variety of ways cannabis is consumed, among which inhalation (smoking and vaporizing) and ingestion are most common. All consumption methods involve heating the plant's THCA to decarboxylate it into THC, either at the time of consumption or during preparation. Salves and absorption through the skin (transdermal) are increasingly common in medical uses, both of CBD, THC, and other cannabinoids. Each method leads to subtly different psychoactive effects due to the THC and other chemicals being activated, and then consumed through different administration routes. It is generally considered that smoking, which includes combustion toxins, comes on quickly but lasts for a short period of time, while eating delays the onset of effect but the duration of effect is typically longer. In a 2007 ScienceDaily report of research conducted at the University of California–San Francisco, researchers reported that vaporizer users experience the same biological effect, but without the toxins associated with smoking. Δ9-THC is the primary component when inhaled, but when eaten the liver converts this to the more psychoactive 11-hydroxy-THC form. Cannabis can be smoked with implements such as joints, blunts, bongs, and pipes. Makeshift pipes or commercial pipes may be used, or cigarette-like joint or cigar-like blunt may be smoked. Local methods have differed by the preparation of the cannabis plant before use, the parts of the cannabis plant that are used, and the treatment of the smoke before inhalation. In early times, as in some parts of Africa today, a pile of cannabis was simply laid on a fire and the smoke inhaled. Archaeological evidence confirms psychoactive cannabis was smoked at least 2,500 years ago in the Pamir Mountains. A vaporizer heats herbal cannabis to 157–210°C (315–410°F), which causes the active ingredients to evaporate into a gas without burning any plant material (the boiling point of THC is 157°C (315°F)). Vaporizing releases a lower proportion of carbon monoxide and other toxic chemicals than does smoking, although the proportion may vary depending on the design of the vaporizer and the temperature at which it is set. A MAPS–NORML study using a Volcano vaporizer reported 95% THC and no toxins delivered in the vapor. An older study using less sophisticated vaporizers found some toxins. A pocket-sized form of a vaporizer may feature a rechargeable battery, heating chamber, and protective cover. Typically, portable vaporizers can only be used for liquids, feature pre-soaked wicks, and require the user to operate a cartridge. As an alternative to inhalation methods, cannabis may be ingested. However, herbal cannabis must be sufficiently heated or dehydrated to cause decarboxylation of its most abundant cannabinoid, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), into psychoactive tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Although hashish is sometimes eaten raw or mixed with boiling water, THC and other cannabinoids are more efficiently absorbed into the bloodstream when combined with butter and other lipids or, less so, dissolved in ethanol. Chocolates, brownies, space cakes, and majoun are popular methods of ingestion - which are usually called edibles. The time to onset of effects depends strongly on stomach content, but is usually 1 to 2 hours, and may continue for a considerable length of time, whereas the effects of smoking or vaporizing cannabis are almost immediate, lasting a shorter length of time. All of the active constituents enter the body when cannabis is consumed orally. It has been shown that the primary active component of cannabis, Δ9-THC, is converted to the more psychoactive 11-hydroxy-THC by the liver. Titration to the desired effect by ingestion is more difficult than through inhalation, due to the long onset time for the effects. Cannabis material can be leached in high-proof spirits (often grain alcohol) to create a “Green Dragon”. Cannabis can also be consumed as a cannabis tea and many other beverages. Although THC is lipophilic and only slightly water soluble (with a solubility of 2.8mg per liter), enough THC can be dissolved to make a mildly psychoactive tea. However, water-based infusions (liquid edibles) are generally considered to be an inefficient use of the herb. Traditional cannabis-infused drinks include the Indian drinks Bhang lassi and Bhang thandai when prepared with bhang. However, bhang, a decoction of cannabis and spices in milk, averts the issue, as milk contains the fat in which the THC is soluble and first dissolved by cooking in ghee.",Normal
"Mitohondrial optic neuropathies are a heterogenous group of disorders that present with visual disturbances resultant from mitochondrial dysfunction within the anatomy of the Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGC), optic nerve, optic chiasm, and optic tract. These disturbances are multifactorial, their aetiology consisting of metabolic andor structural damage as a consequence of genetic mutations, environmental stressors, or both. The three most common neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities seen in mitochondrial disorders are bilateral optic neuropathy, ophthalmoplegia with ptosis, and pigmentary retinopathy. The generalized, common presentation for this broad and inclusive group of diseases is painless, bilateral loss of visual acuity and pallor of the optic disc accompanied with varying degrees of dyschromatopsia and centralcecocentral scatomas. On examination the pupillary responses may be sluggish to light. One would not expect to find an afferent pupillary defect because optic neuropathies are often bilateral and symmetric. The optic disc may appear mildly hyperemic with small splinter hemorrhages on or around the disc, or may appear nearly normal. Optic atrophy typically develops later and may appear mild. In later stages the optic atrophy can become severe, which indicates less opportunity for recovery. The duration of onset can vary between immediate and insidious, owing to the specific etiology. Two key features may be helpful in distinguishing acquired from inherited optic neuropathies: absence of a family history and simultaneous involvement of both eyes; the former more commonly characterized by these two features. Because this grouping of diseases is of heterogenic origin, the causes can be singular or additive consequences of genetic, toxic, or nutritional stress. Mitochondria are maternally inherited, so a genetic defect in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is passed on from mother to child. Mitochondria, however, depend on other proteins that are encoded by nuclear genes, constructed in the cytoplasm and then transported into the mitochondria. So it follows that, while an mtDNA point mutation are inherited through the mother, defects in nuclear DNA, even those affecting the mitochondria, will be transmitted in Mendelian fashion. Optic neuropathies that are acquired can be the result of several processes. These include prolonged use of certain antibiotics or anti-tuberculosis medications, exposure to certain toxic chemicals, and situations that contribute to poor consumption or decreased absorption of nutrient-dense foods. A possible synergism between genetic and acquired mitochondrial optic neuropathies has been suggested and there are only a few case reports to support this phenomenon, requiring further research and demonstration of evidence to corroborate these findings Nutritional deficiency may be the cause of a genuine optic neuropathy, sometimes associated with involvement of the peripheral nervous system, called peripheral neuropathy. Loss of vision is usually bilateral, painless, chronic, insidious and slowly progressive. Most often, they present as a non-specific retrobulbar optic neuropathy. Patients may notice that colors are not as vivid or bright as before and that the color red is washed out. This normally occurs in both eyes at the same time and is not associated with any eye pain. They might initially notice a blur or fog, followed by a drop in vision. While vision loss may be rapid, progression to blindness is unusual. These patients tend to have blind spots in the center of their vision with preserved peripheral vision. In most cases, the pupils continue to respond normally to light. Again, the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in nutritional optic neuropathies is common to all mitochondrial optic neuropathies: it affects biochemical pathways involved in cell energetic production, correction of oxidative stress and quenching of free radicals. Specific deficiencies of cyanocobalamin, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and pyridoxine, folic acid, and other proteins with sulfur-containing amino acids may play a role. Months of depletion are usually necessary to deplete body stores of most nutrients and a nutritional optic neuropathy may be present in a patient with or without obvious evidence of under-nutrition. An individual suffering from starvation could be easily recognized as a person who is undernourished due to their cachectic corporal appearance. However, a not so obvious individual may be the recipient of a gastric bypass surgery, a procedure that may lead to vitamin B12 deficiency from poor absorption. The optic neuropathy associated with pernicious anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency can be seen amongst individuals who obtain adequate caloric input from foods low in nutritional and micronutrient density (see Food desert). Additionally, nutrient-poor diet may also be low in anti-oxidants, substances critical to preventing the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are a natural bi-product of the mitochondrial production of ATP. As such, if they are allowed to accumulate without being neutralized, they could damage the very mitochondria from which they are being produced. There is documentation of nutritional optic neuropathy among undernourished Allied prisoners of war of the Japanese during World War II. After four months of food deprivation, some of the prisoners developed sub-acute vision loss in both eyes in addition to experiencing pain in their extremities and hearing loss. Their visual loss did not correlate well with malnutrition and that not all prisoners experienced the loss of vision. Toxic optic neuropathy refers to the ingestion of a toxin or an adverse drug reaction that results in vision loss from optic nerve damage. Patients may report either a sudden loss of vision in both eyes, in the setting of an acute intoxication, or an insidious asymmetric loss of vision from an adverse drug reaction. The most important aspect of treatment is recognition and drug withdrawal. Among the many causes of TON, the top 10 toxins include: Metabolic disorders may also cause this version of disease. Systemic problems such as diabetes mellitus, kidney failure, and thyroid disease can cause optic neuropathy, which is likely through buildup of toxic substances within the body. In most cases, the cause of the toxic neuropathy impairs the tissue's vascular supply or metabolism. It remains unknown as to why certain agents are toxic to the optic nerve while others are not and why particularly the papillomacular bundle gets affected. TAA is an old term for a constellation of elements that can lead to a mitochondrial optic neuropathy. The classic patient is a man with a history of heavy alcohol and tobacco consumption. Respectively, this combines nutritional mitochondrial impairment, from vitamin deficiencies (folate and B-12) classically seen in alcoholics, with tobacco-derived products, such as cyanide and ROS. It has been suggested that the additive effect of the cyanide toxicity, ROS, and deficiencies of thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, and b12 result in TAA. Between 1992 and 1993, in the Cuban Epidemic of Optic Neuropathy, nearly 50,000 people in Cuba were affected with optic neuropathy, sensory and autonomic peripheral neuropathy, neural deafness, and in a few cases, myelopathy. The most common pattern of symptoms consisted of severe weight loss, fatigue and a subacute loss of vision. On the fundus, an objective sign was noted: a wedge defect of the temporal optic disc and the loss of the corresponding Papillomacular bundle. Most of the patients reported high consumption of alcohol particularly homemade rum and smoking cigarettes. This was associated with severe deficiencies of protein and vitamin intake, in particular of vitamin B12 and folate. This picture of vitamin deficiencies was exacerbated by low levels of methanol present in homemade rum. It was thought that the Cuban epidemic may have been caused by the chronic accumulation of formate from methanol metabolism in a population with severe folic acid depletion and the accumulation of cyanide from cigarette smoke. This conclusion was supported by evidence of improvement in visual acuity on prompt and daily administration of cyanocobalamin (3mg) and folate (250mg) along with dietary supplementation. The inherited optic neuropathies typically manifest as symmetric bilateral central visual loss. Optic nerve damage in most inherited optic neuropathies is permanent and progressive. LHON, as the name suggests, is an inherited mutation that results in acute or subacute vision loss, displays incomplete penetrance and predominantly affects young males. Onset is usually between the 2nd and 4th decade of life, and usually presents with rapid vision loss in one eye followed by involvement of the second eye (usually within months). Visual acuity often remains stable and poor (below 20200) with a residual central visual field defect. Patients with the m.14484ND6 mutation are most likely to have visual recovery. DOA is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a defect in the nuclear gene OPA1. A slowly progressive optic neuropathy, usually presents in the first decade of life and is bilaterally symmetrical. Examination of these patients shows loss of visual acuity, temporal pallor of the optic discs, centrocecal scotomas with peripheral sparing, and subtle impairments in color vision. This is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by early-onset optic atrophy, ataxia, and spasticity. This disease is a heterogenous group of inherited neuropathies, stemming from a MFN2 mutation, in which both motor and sensory nerves are affected, resulting in distal limb weakness, sensory loss, decreased deep tendon reflexes, and foot deformities. Affected individuals develop progressive optic nerve dysfunction starting later in childhood. HSP is marked by slowly progressive lower limb spasticity and weakness. HSP can be classified into pure and complicated forms, depending on whether additional clinical features are present besides spastic paraplegia, such as optic atrophy, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, extrapyramidal deficits, and cognitive decline. FA is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by pathological GAA trinucleotide repeat expansions in the FXN gene. The encoded protein frataxin is directed to the mitochondrial inner membrane and is involved in the assembly of iron-sulphur cluster, which are a critical component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. In a recent study of 26 patients with confirmed FA, all patients had evidence of optic nerve dysfunction, although only five were visually symptomatic. The optic neuropathy differed from that of LHON or DOA, displaying a pattern of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) loss and no preferential involvement of papillomacular bundle. Includes Mitochondrial Encephalitis Lactic Acidosis Seizures (MELAS), myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fibers (MERRF), maternally inherited Leigh syndrome (MILS), and mitochondrial neurograstrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE), all of which can all develop optic neuropathies, although it is usually a secondary feature overshadowed by more prominent neurological features. As our understanding of mitochondrial diseases improves a degree of similarity and overlap are seen within this group of disorders. For example, in some OPA1 carriers, patients will develop neurological features indistinguishable from HSP while others develop a pattern of peripheral neuropathy with a similar disease course to CMT, and still others will develop a prominent cerebellar syndrome consistent with FRDA. Even though dysfunction of the mitochondria can be either congenital or acquired, both causes share a common pathophysiology: an impairment of oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondria, which leads to a decrease of ATP production and a simultaneous increase in ROS. These mitochondria are made within the central somata of the retinal ganglion cell, transported down axons, and distributed where they are needed. Efficient transportation of mitochondria depends on multiple factors, including their own energy production, the integrity of the cytoskeleton and its protein components (tubulin, etc.), and adequate myelination of the axons. Any dysfunction of these systems may be of pathological relevance for optic neuropathies with primary or secondary involvement of mitochondria. Genetic mutations, toxic insult, and nutritional depletion can all have a negative impact on the structure and function of mitochondria within the optic system, resulting in this type of neuropathy. A thorough history is essential and should cover family history, diet; drugtoxin exposure social history, including tobacco and alcohol use; and occupational background, with details on whether similar cases exist among coworkers. Treatment of any chronic disease such as pernicious anemia should always be elucidated. In most cases of nutritionaltoxic optic neuropathy, the diagnosis may be obtained via detailed medical history and eye examination. Additionally, supplementary neurological imaging studies, such as MRI or enhanced CT, may be performed if the cause remains unclear. When the details of the examination and history indicate a familial history of similar ocular or systemic disease, whether or not there is evidence of toxic or nutritional causes for disease, certain genetic tests may be required. Because there are several congenital causes of mitochondrial dysfunction, the patients history, examination, and radiological studies must be examined in order to determine the specific genetic tests required. For example, 90% of cases of Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) are associated with three common mtDNA point mutations (m.3460G>AMT-ND1, m.11778G>AMT-ND4, m.14484T>CMT-ND6) while a wider range of mtDNA mutations (MT-ND1, MT-ND5, MT-ND6; http:www.mitomap.org) have been associated with overlapping phenotypes of LHON, MELAS, and Leigh syndrome. Treatment is dependent upon diagnosis and the stage at which the diagnosis is secured. For toxic and nutritional optic neuropathies, the most important course is to remove the offending agent if possible and to replace the missing nutritional elements, orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously. If treatment is delayed, the injury may be irreversible. The course of treatment varies with the congenital forms of these neuropathies. There are some drug treatments that have shown modest success, such as Idebenone used to treat LOHN. Often treatment is relegated to lifestyle alterations and accommodations and supportive measures. Those diseases understood as congenital in origin could either be specific to the ocular organ system (LHON, DOA) or syndromic (MELAS, multiple sclerosis). It is estimated that these inherited optic neuropathies in the aggregate affect 1 in 10,000 Of the acquired category, disease falls into further etiological distinction as arising from toxic (drugs or chemicals) or nutritionalmetabolic (vitamin deficiencydiabetes) insult. It is worth mentioning that under-nutrition and toxic insult can occur simultaneously, so a third category may be understood as having a combined or mixed etiology. We will refer to this as ToxicNutritional Optic Neuropathy, whereby nutritional deficiencies and toxicmetabolic insults are the simultaneous culprits of visual loss associated with damage and disruption of the RGC and optic nerve mitochondria.",Normal

"The Kyrgyz Republic is a source, transit, and to a lesser extent a destination country for men and women trafficked from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan for purposes of forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation. Men and women are trafficked to Kazakhstan for forced agricultural labor—mainly in tobacco fields—to Russia for forced construction work, and to China for bonded labor. Kyrgyz and foreign women are trafficked to the U.A.E., China, Kazakhstan, South Korea, Italy, Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, Thailand, Germany, and Syria for sexual exploitation. The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Although the government demonstrated some limited progress in collecting law enforcement data, complicity in trafficking of low-level government officials remained a concern. NGOs reported improved efforts by law enforcement personnel in referring victims for assistance. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in ""Tier 2"" in 2017. Citizen and foreign women and girls are victims of sex trafficking in Kyrgyzstan. They are raped and physically and physiologically harmed in brothels, hotels, homes, and other locations throughout the country. The Kyrgyz government demonstrated limited law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. A 2005 law on Prevention and Combating Trafficking in Persons criminalizes trafficking for both sexual exploitation and forced labor; prescribed sentences range from three to 20 years’ imprisonment, which are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other grave crimes, such as rape. In 2007, the government conducted 33 investigations—19 of them pertaining to alleged labor trafficking crimes—compared to 39 investigations in total in 2006. The government did not provide complete data on trafficking prosecutions, though authorities report the conviction of 23 trafficking offenders in 2007. Although the government was unable to provide complete sentencing data, some convicted traffickers served sentences ranging from five to eight years’ imprisonment. NGOs contended that low-level law enforcement officials were complicit and accepted bribes from traffickers; other low-level police reportedly tolerated trafficking due to a lack of awareness. The government provided law enforcement personnel with trafficking- awareness training. The government sustained modest efforts to assist victims during the reporting period. Although the government provided no direct funding for victim services or medical assistance, it continued to provide space for three shelters run by anti-trafficking NGOs. Law enforcement referred four victims to IOM and NGOs for assistance in 2007. In 2007, Kyrgyz citizens identified abroad and repatriated to Kyrgyzstan accounted for 134 of the total of 331 victims identified. Victims are encouraged to participate in trafficking investigations and prosecutions; victims who do not cooperate with law enforcement are potentially subject to being penalized for immigration violations and related offenses, although there were no reports of victims being penalized during the reporting period. The witness protection law, passed in 2006, continued to lack implementation procedures; as a result, no victims of crime—including trafficking victims— were protected by police in 2007. Kyrgyzstan demonstrated limited trafficking prevention efforts over the last year. The government continued to focus significant attention on migration issues and worked to improve protection for all Kyrgyz migrant workers abroad in Russia and other destination countries. The government continued to publish brochures and leaflets in Kyrgyz and Russian for those seeking work abroad warning of the dangers of trafficking and providing the number for IOM-operated trafficking assistance hot-lines in several countries. The government does not actively monitor immigration and emigration patterns for evidence of trafficking.",Normal
"""Back to the Shack"" is a song by the American rock band Weezer. It was released as the first single from their ninth studio album Everything Will Be Alright in the End on July 22, 2014. The song was sent to radio stations and uploaded to Weezer's YouTube channel a day before the single's official release. It was written in response to the band's past several albums, with lead vocalist Rivers Cuomo wanting to return to their roots. The song received generally favorable reviews. ""Back to the Shack"" was written by Rivers Cuomo and Jacob Kasher Hindlin. The song was produced by Ric Ocasek. Cuomo wrote a majority of the song, with Karl Koch describing Jacob Kasher Hindlin's contribution to the song as ""randomly singing out the title while hanging out on the couch listening to  strumming the song. It doesn't take much to get half a songwriting credit."" At one point, the song was performed with the bridge containing the lyric ""we belong in the rock zone"", before Cuomo, based on fan suggestions changed it from ""rock zone"" to ""rock world"". Regarding the composition of the song, Cuomo stated that he ""tried to find different melodies and different beats and all these different things."" Further, he stated that as he ""couldn't crack the code"" they had to go ahead and record it anyway. Ocasek introduced a synth melody line to the song during this period. Cuomo explained that the lyrics refer to how he feels bad for the direction the band has taken on some of their past material. He admitted that sometimes he ""went over the edge"". He explained his desire to create ""a classic alt-rock record."" The ""shack"" serves as a reference to Amherst house, a home where some of the original Weezer members had lived and recorded a few of their demos. Lyrically, ""Back to the Shack"" deals with the theme of nostalgia and a wish to return ""to  1994 roots"". Dave Lewis stated the song serves as a thematic continuation of two previous Weezer songs, ""In the Garage"" and ""Memories"". It also deals with Weezer's relationship with their fans and serves as ""basically an apology for the past two decades and a promise to embrace their nerdy roots."" The song's opening lines—""I'm sorry guys, I didn't realize that I needed you so much""—in particular reinforce this theme. The song has been categorized under alternative rock and power pop. ""Back to the Shack"" received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Carolyn Menyes from Music Times regarded ""Back to the Shack"" to be instrumentally similar to the band's second album Pinkerton, and stated that the song ""features hooks for days, and the turn of events in the chorus is nothing short of a pure earworm."" Mike Ayers of The Wall Street Journal described the song as ""three minutes of pure Weezer joy"", particularly for ""its simple, yet heavy riffs and self-deprecating lyrics"", while Spin critic Colin Joyce complimented the song for its ""anthemic choruses and guitar anti-heroics"". HitFix reviewer Dave Lewis called the song ""generic rock"", although he went on to compliment the middle eight and considered the song as a whole to be ""a lot more promising"", than their more recent releases. Chris Payne of Billboard ranked it as the band's fifth best lead single, beating out ""Hash Pipe"", ""(If You're Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You To"", ""Pork and Beans"", and ""Memories"". Hilary Hughes of Fuse praised it as a return to the band's old sound, saying ""a promising look at what's sure to be a satisfying listen for new and old fans alike."" Ian Rogers from The Vine commented that it ""Sounds exactly like a highly professional, crassly commercial L.A. rock band performing a Weezer-styled song about Weezer returning to their roots."" ""Back to the Shack"" was released as the first single from Everything Will Be Alright in the End on July 22, 2014. The day before its release, the song was sent to radio stations, and uploaded to the band's YouTube channel. Prior to release, the song was performed in February during the 2014 Weezer Cruise. The band performed it on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on July 23, the song's first performance on television. In August, the song was played during Musikfest. The music video for ""Back to the Shack"" was directed by Warren Fu and released on September 29, 2014. The video features the band performing the song on the moon.",Normal

"In It for the Money is the second studio album by English alternative rock band Supergrass, released in 1997. NME called it ""more fun than watching a wombat in a washing machine"" and named it the 10th best album of the year. In 1998, Q readers voted it the 68th greatest album of all time, while in 2000 the same magazine placed it at number 57 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. Only two songs were written before entering Sawmills Studio, so most of the tracks were penned during recording itself. Recording was often disrupted by the drummer Danny Goffey impromptly going back to London, to record with his and Pearl Lowe's band Lodger. He was told by management that this was unacceptable behaviour. This, along with Gaz Coombes and Goffey's bickering in the music press about the underlying meaning of lyrics to ""Going Out"", put strain on the recording process. It is speculated that Parlophone, the record label Supergrass were on, offered the band a sum of money to decide on a final name for the album, because they were taking too long to deliberate. However, the band themselves claim that they never received any of this money in return. Other suggestions considered for the title of the album included Hold on to the Handrail and Children of the Monkey Basket (which is now the name of the band's self-run website). ""Richard III"" and ""Sun Hits the Sky"" appear to end with snippets of other, unreleased songs, that play until fade out. The guitar solo in ""Sometimes I Make You Sad"" was written during the recording of In It for the Money; it was recorded at half speed then sped up to achieve the mandolin-like sound. The only use of percussion in the song is a cymbal, the drum noises were instead simulated by members of the band making 'grunting' noises. These were then put on a loop. The album cover is a photograph of the band busking during the filming of the video for their single ""Cheapskate"". The Japanese edition has, instead, an oil painting by Maff Burley, an old school friend of Danny Goffey. In it, the band is curled up in a circular window at the Old Sawmills at Fowey. The album was critically acclaimed, and peaked at No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart, and sold 300,000 copies in the UK and over one million worldwide. ""The fact that it has sold more worldwide than I Should Coco,"" said Gaz Coombes, ""means we can sleep at night."" ""In It for the Money is my favourite album of the year…"" declared The Prodigy's Liam Howlett at the close of 1997. ""It's quality music.

"The Bezirksoberliga Mittelfranken was the seventh tier of the German football league system in the Bavarian Regierungsbezirk of Middle Franconia (German: Mittelfranken). Until the introduction of the 3. Liga in 2008 it was the sixth tier of the league system, until the introduction of the Regionalligas in 1994 the fifth tier. The league was disbanded at the end of the 2011–12 season, when major changes to the Bavarian football league system were carried out. Above the Bezirksoberligas, the Landesligas were expanded in number from three to five divisions and the Bezirke have two to three regional leagues, the Bezirksligas, as its highest level again, similar to the system in place until 1988. The Bezirksoberligas in Bavaria were introduced in 1988 to create a highest single-division playing level for each of the seven Regierungsbezirke. The term Bezirksoberliga translates roughly into County Premier League, a Regierungsbezirk being a similar administrative entity to a County. Before the introduction of the Bezirksoberligas, the Bezirksliga was the level of play below the Landesliga. The Bezirksliga Mittelfranken-Nord and Mittelfranken-Süd fed the Landesliga Bayern-Mitte as they afterwards feed the Bezirksoberliga Mittelfranken. The winner of the Bezirksoberliga Mittelfranken, like the winner of the Bezirksoberliga Niederbayern and Bezirksoberliga Oberpfalz, was directly promoted to the Landesliga Bayern-Mitte. The second placed teams out of those leagues played-off for another promotion spot with the 15th placed team out of the Landesliga for the last spot there. However, in some years additional promotion places were available in the Landesliga. The three bottom teams of the Bezirksoberliga were relegated to the Bezirksliga, the team just above those faced a play-off against the second placed Bezirksliga teams. With the league reform at the end of the 2011–12 season, which includes an expansion of the number of Landesligas from three to five, the Bezirksoberligas were disbanded.

"When No One Would Listen is a 1992 American made-for-television film, telling the story of housewife Jessica Cochran (Michele Lee), and the domestic violence she faces from her controlling, mentally unstable husband Gary Cochran (James Farentino). The film featured main actress Michele Lee as the executive producer. When No One Would Listen is set in Glen Oaks, Queens, although the case it is based upon occurred elsewhere. When No One Would Listen is loosely based on David Guenther, also known as the ""Make My Day Killer"" due to the shooting of his neighbours in what he claimed was self-defence against their trespassing. Guenther had been the first person to invoke the State of Colorado's ""Make My Day"" law, which allows residents to use deadly force in their homes against intruders. Guenther later shot and murdered his estranged wife Pamela (age 30), and severely injured her boyfriend, Stanley Stinson, who survived. The Guenthers’ two children, Christopher (age 13), and Jennifer (age 11), saw the shootings and were key prosecution witnesses along with Stinson. Names and places in When No One Would Listen were changed to protect remaining witnesses and the Guenther children. Timid housewife Jessica Cochran (Michele Lee) has been married to her controlling husband Gary (James Farentino) for years. She began dating him at the age of fifteen and has two children, daughter Maggie (Anndi McAfee) and son Pete (Damion Stevens). Gary had hit Jessica and threatened to kill her early-on in their relationship, although he has never hit the children. Both children are aware that Gary beats their mother, but they feel powerless to stop the abuse. After some career trouble, Gary moves the family out to the New York suburb of Glen Oaks. At first, Gary seems like a sweet and loving husband, but after getting mad at some hippie neighbours who enjoy smoking marijuana, drinking alcohol and partying, he becomes obsessed with these neighbours, constantly reporting them to the police for petty reasons. Unemployed, Gary takes out his anger on Jessica. He attempts to cover up his inability to secure a new job by buying Maggie and Pete a VCR and a VHS tape of Disney's The Little Mermaid, but then begins verbally attacking Jessica and his neighbours when Jessica asks him if he got a new job. Jessica takes up a part-time job at a bakery to help make ends meet; there she meets a new friend named Lee (Lee Garlington), who makes pottery as a hobby and shares some cigarettes with Jessica while they laugh at risque sex jokes. Lee declares that she ""likes  buns!"" (referring to Jessica's sourdough buns from the bakery), after which Jessica quips back, ""well, I like your jugs!"" (referring to Lee's pottery). Jessica also befriends her new boss, Walter, and becomes close with him. Meanwhile, Gary criticizes Jessica for wearing a knee-length skirt to work, telling her that she has fat legs. Lee and Walter begin to notice bruises on Jessica's body, and urge her to divorce Gary and flee with the children. One night, during a particularly loud house party, a hippie stumbles drunk up to the Cochran home and repeatedly knocks on the door, making annoying noises. Gary responds by shooting and killing the hippie's pregnant wife, which horrifies Jessica. Gary is released from jail after claiming that the neighbours were trespassing on his private property, and arguing that the shooting was in self-defence. Meanwhile, while trying to teach Pete how to fight back against some local school bullies, he violently punches Pete in the stomach, causing the boy to collapse on the floor. Jessica catches Pete that night applying ice cubes from the kitchen freezer onto a large bruise up one side of his body. Realizing that Gary is beginning to beat the children, she sneaks out of the home and spends the night with Walter. She begins dating Walter, although Lee advises Jessica to go underground to a women's shelter because of Gary's murderous history. Gary becomes more and more unhinged, attempting at one point to force Maggie and Pete into his car so he can abduct them. Walter and Jessica are able to pull the children away from him and rescue them. Lee takes Jessica to the police for a restraining order, but the issuing judge (Ellen Crawford) warns Jessica that a restraining order is merely a piece of paper, with no power to physically stop Gary from coming back. Gary lures Jessica back into the Cochran home and holds her hostage, forcing her to put on skimpy black lingerie while he proceeds to rape her. The next morning, a SWAT team arrives and a hostage negotiator is able to convince Gary to let Jessica free. Despite Gary's actions, he is once again kept out of jail. Jessica moves into a women's shelter for the sake of Maggie and Pete, both of whom make friends at the shelter and begin resuming normal childhood activities, like drawing pictures. Jessica continues dating Walter, and they decide one evening to take the children to a diner for supper, in the hopes that it will be a fun activity to distract themselves from Gary. Unbeknownst to them, Gary has found the women's shelter and is following Jessica in his car. Jessica, Walter and the children eat a meal together while Gary watches from outside. Upon exiting the diner, Jessica and Walter share a kiss, infuriating Gary, who steps out of his hiding place and shoots Jessica and Walter with a revolver. An ending scene reveals that the real ""Jessica Cochran"" (Pamela Guenther) was mortally wounded by the gunshots and died, while the real ""Walter Wheeler"" (Stanley Stinson) recovered from his injuries and testified against Gary in court. It is revealed that the real ""Maggie"" and ""Pete"" Cochran (Christopher and Jennifer Guenther) were taken in by their grandparents after the killing of their mother. When No One Would Listen received mixed reviews from critics, with Richard Huff of Variety praising the acting of John Spencer as Walter, and saying of the film itself, ""Cindy Myer’s writing is at times moving and other times predictable and sappy. Yet using both Jessica and Gary to narrate during the picture adds another aspect to the project that helps to snare and build tension for the viewers."" Mental health information directory Therapy Route praised the film for its accurate portrayal of domestic abuse, adding When No One Would Listen to its ""Movies about domestic violence and abuse - Mental Health Related Films"" list. When No One Would Listen continues to air sporadically on the Lifetime Movie Network, and has been uploaded as a bootleg copy to YouTube by various users. The film was nominated for three different awards, including a Young Artist Award for Best Actress in a Television Movie (for Anndi McAfee in the role of Maggie Cochran).",Normal

"The universal embedding theorem, or Krasner–Kaloujnine universal embedding theorem, is a theorem from the mathematical discipline of group theory first published in 1951 by Marc Krasner and Lev Kaluznin. The theorem states that any group extension of a group H by a group A is isomorphic to a subgroup of the regular wreath product AWrH. The theorem is named for the fact that the group AWrH is said to be universal with respect to all extensions of H by A. Let H and A be groups, let K=AH be the set of all functions from H to A, and consider the action of H on itself by right multiplication. This action extends naturally to an action of H on K defined by ϕ ( g ) . h = ϕ ( g h − 1 ) , {displaystyle phi (g).h=phi (gh^{-1}),} where ϕ ∈ K , {displaystyle phi in K,} and g and h are both in H. This is an automorphism of K, so we can define the semidirect product K⋊H called the regular wreath product, and denoted AWrH or A ≀ H . {displaystyle Awr H.} The group K=AH (which is isomorphic to { ( f x , 1 ) ∈ A ≀ H : x ∈ K } {displaystyle {(f_{x},1)in Awr H:xin K}} ) is called the base group of the wreath product. The Krasner–Kaloujnine universal embedding theorem states that if G has a normal subgroup A and H=GA, then there is an injective homomorphism of groups θ : G → A ≀ H {displaystyle theta :Gto Awr H} such that A maps surjectively onto im ( θ ) ∩ K . {displaystyle {text{im}}(theta )cap K.}  This is equivalent to the wreath product AWrH having a subgroup isomorphic to G, where G is any extension of H by A. This proof comes from Dixon–Mortimer. Define a homomorphism ψ : G → H {displaystyle psi :Gto H} whose kernel is A. Choose a set T = { t u : u ∈ H } {displaystyle T={t_{u}:uin H}} of (right) coset representatives of A in G, where ψ ( t u ) = u . {displaystyle psi (t_{u})=u.} Then for all x in G, t u x t u ψ ( x ) − 1 ∈ ker ⁡ ψ = A . {displaystyle t_{u}xt_{upsi (x)}^{-1}in ker psi =A.} For each x in G, we define a function fx:H→ A such that f x ( u ) = t u x t u ψ ( x ) − 1 . {displaystyle f_{x}(u)=t_{u}xt_{upsi (x)}^{-1}.} Then the embedding θ {displaystyle theta } is given by θ ( x ) = ( f x , ψ ( x ) ) ∈ A ≀ H . {displaystyle theta (x)=(f_{x},psi (x))in Awr H.} We now prove that this is a homomorphism. If x and y are in G, then θ ( x ) θ ( y ) = ( f x ( f y . ψ ( x ) − 1 ) , ψ ( x y ) ) . {displaystyle theta (x)theta (y)=(f_{x}(f_{y}.psi (x)^{-1}),psi (xy)).} Now f y ( u ) . ψ ( x ) − 1 = f y ( u ψ ( x ) ) , {displaystyle f_{y}(u).psi (x)^{-1}=f_{y}(upsi (x)),} so for all u in H, so fxfy=fxy. Hence θ {displaystyle theta } is a homomorphism as required. The homomorphism is injective. If θ ( x ) = θ ( y ) , {displaystyle theta (x)=theta (y),} then both fx(u)=fy(u) (for all u) and ψ ( x ) = ψ ( y ) . {displaystyle psi (x)=psi (y).} Then t u x t u ψ ( x ) − 1 = t u y t u ψ ( y ) − 1 , {displaystyle t_{u}xt_{upsi (x)}^{-1}=t_{u}yt_{upsi (y)}^{-1},} but we can cancel tu and t u ψ ( x ) − 1 = t u ψ ( y ) − 1 {displaystyle t_{upsi (x)}^{-1}=t_{upsi (y)}^{-1}} from both sides, so x=y, hence θ {displaystyle theta } is injective. Finally, θ ( x ) ∈ K {displaystyle theta (x)in K} precisely when ψ ( x ) = 1 , {displaystyle psi (x)=1,} in other words when x ∈ A {displaystyle xin A} (as A = ker ⁡ ψ {displaystyle A=ker psi } ).",Normal
"Democratic seat Republican seat The 1874 United States elections occurred in the middle of Republican President Ulysses S. Grant's second term, during the Third Party System. Members of the 44th United States Congress were chosen in this election. The election took place during the Reconstruction Era, and many Southerners were barred from voting. Colorado joined the union during the 44th Congress. Democrats took control of a chamber of Congress for the first time since the start of the Civil War, winning a huge number of seats from House Republicans. However, the Republicans retained a majority in the Senate. The election marked the first occurrence of the six-year itch phenomenon, in which a president's party lost many Congressional seats during the president's second mid-term election. The Panic of 1873, a series of scandals, and an unpopular Congressional pay raise all damaged the Republican Party's brand. With the passage of the Reconstruction amendments, the importance of the parties' roles in the Civil War also receded in the minds of many. Though Republicans won governorships in Northern states such as Pennsylvania, the election increased Democratic power in the South, which it later dominated after the end of Reconstruction. In the House, Democrats won massive gains when the Republicans lost a total of 92 seats (the third-largest swing in the history of the House, and the second-largest House loss by the Republican Party), turning a dominant Republican majority into a similarly dominant Democratic majority. In the Senate, Democrats picked up several seats, but Republicans retained a commanding majority. This American elections-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",Normal

This gene encodes a WD repeat protein, which interacts with the Cockayne syndrome type B (CSB) and p44 proteins, the latter being a subunit of the RNA polymerase II transcription factor II H. Mutations in this gene have been identified in patients with the hereditary disease Cockayne syndrome (CS). CS is an accelerated aging disorder characterized by photosensitivity, impaired development and multi-system progressive degeneration. The CS cells are abnormally sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and are defective in the repair of transcriptionally active genes. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. CS arises from germline mutations in either of two genes CSA(ERCC8) or CSB(ERCC6). CSA mutations generally give rise to a more moderate form of CS than CSB mutations. Mutations in the CSA gene account for about 20% of CS cases. CSA and CSB proteins are thought to function in transcription and DNA repair, most notably in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. CSA and CSB-deficient cells exhibit a lack of preferential repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in actively transcribed genes, consistent with a failed transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair response. Within the cell, the CSA protein localizes to sites of DNA damage, particularly inter-strand cross-links, double-strand breaks and some mono-adducts. ERCC8 (gene) has been shown to interact with XAB2. This article on a gene on human chromosome 5 is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",Normal

"Music from the Motion Picture: The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn is the soundtrack for the 2011 computer-animated actionadventure film The Adventures of Tintin directed and produced by Steven Spielberg, based on Belgian cartoonist Hergé's comic book series of the same name. The film score is composed by John Williams, which is the first time he had composed the score of a film since Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) as well as his first score for an animated film. The score was released on 21 October 2011 by Sony Classical Records. Williams received a nomination for Best Original Score at the 84th Academy Awards for his work in the film. Most of the score was written while the animation was still in the early stages, with Williams seeking to employ ""the old Disney technique of doing music first and have the animators trying to follow what the music is doing"". Eventually, several cues had to be revised during the editing of the film, when the editor Michael Kahn shown the rough cut. The composer decided to employ various musical styles, with ""1920s–30s European jazz"" for the opening credits and ""pirate music"" for the battle at sea. Track 13, ""Presenting Biance Castafiore,"" quotes music from The Barber of Seville, specifically the aria ""Una voce poco fa."" All music is composed by John Williams James Christopher Monger of AllMusic stated that, ""Williams does not exaggerate the effects for comic purposes as he does, for example, in his Indiana Jones scores. Rather, this is ear candy for a movie that is equally sweet."" Author Brad Kamminga wrote: ""John Williams score for The Adventures of Tintin lacks the glorious and splendorous themes that defined many of Williams famous scores. Aside from that The Adventures of Tintin is an excellent score. John Williams, in his old age, proves once again that he has not lost his touch and remains to be a truly unrivaled composer  If you are a huge fan of John Williams and his complex works, this is definitely a score you need to purchase, but if you only enjoy the brilliant main theme songs Williams has composed in the past, don’t expect to hear them in this score."" Filmtracks.com wrote ""if there is no substitute for John Williams' intellectual superiority over his peers, for even when approaching 80 years old, his comedic adventure techniques dazzle you with complexities of structure and instrumentation not heard elsewhere"". Writing for the Limelight (magazine), Francis Merson summarised the review as ""John Williams takes on a cartoon legend"". Soundtrack Geek-based Jorn Tilnes wrote ""John Williams is well and truly back ladies and gentlemen and you can really hear it in the score how terrific a composer he is. It's so full of energy, adventure and action and is perhaps only let down by a slight inconsistency. It doesn't sound like vintage John Williams from start to finish, but there are a lot of fun to be had and although the themes aren't as good as Williams absolute best, they represents Tintin well and some of them are easily remembered. In the review for Static Mass Emporium, Phil Blanckley summarised ""The rhythmic flow of the score keeps you gripped throughout, and although it may not tug at the heartstrings as much as Williams' previous compositions, it does what it is intended to do – create the feeling of adventure. At times, it does seem like a never-ending frenzy of a musical mayhem, but it his John williams' at his best.""",Normal
"Make It Big is the second studio album by English pop duo Wham!, released in 1984. In comparison to their earlier work, Wham! (George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley) had more control over the album's production and Michael would also be credited as a producer. The album was a commercial success, hitting number one in both the US and the UK and spawning four singles, all reaching the top three in the US and the UK. The music video for single ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"" had the duo in shirts that read Choose Life. It would be the first of several hits from the album. The second single ""Careless Whisper"" is technically a Wham! song as it appears on the Wham! album Make It Big. However, when released as a single, it was credited either to Wham! featuring George Michael (in North America and several other countries) or solely to George Michael (in the United Kingdom and some European countries) as it became apparent, that at some point in the near future, Michael would be embarking on a solo career. The music video for third single ""Freedom"" featured the duo while performing a concert in China; incidentally Wham! would become the first Western popular music act to tour China. The fourth single ""Everything She Wants"" was released as a double A-side with ""Last Christmas""; ""Last Christmas"" would later appear on Music from the Edge of Heaven, an album released only in North America and Japan. Make It Big was certified 4× platinum in the US during the time of its release, and has since been certified 6× platinum in the US. The album was mostly written and recorded at Studio Miraval in Southern France over a course of six weeks, beginning in early July 1984. This allowed Michael to escape press attention and work peacefully. According to Andrew Ridgeley, the decision to record in the south of France was made largely due to tax reasons, as well as it being the ideal place for them to spend the summer due to the hot weather. Plus, it was one and a half hours away from London, and Michael ""had to keep going back to do things for Careless Whisper"". Like ""Careless Whisper"" and ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"", most of the songs were recorded with a live rhythm section. The main album credits attribute it as having been mixed at Good Earth Studios in London and Marcadet Studios in Paris. However, it turns out to be neither, as engineer Porter revealed: most of the album was mixed at Sarm West's Studio 2 (where ""Careless Whisper"" and ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"" were recorded), with some mixing already completed at Studio Miraval. Make It Big, Wham's second album, would see the duo score hit singles in the United States. Their first album Fantastic was a hit in the UK but failed to make an impact in the US. Make it Big received some positive reviews. Christopher Connelly from Rolling Stone wrote that the ""music is an unabashed rehash of Motown"", adding ""Make It Big is an almost flawless pop record, a record that does exactly what it wants to and has a great deal of fun doing it."" In a retrospective review Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic writes, ""They succeeded on a grander scale than they ever could have imagined, conquering the world and elsewhere with this effervescent set of giddy new wave pop-soul."" All tracks are written by George Michael, except where noted Wham!

Wham! embarked on a world tour to promote the album in December 1984, opening at Whitley Bay's Ice Rink, before going on to dates in Japan, Australia, United States, United Kingdom, Hong Kong and China, ending in April 1985 at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Canton.",Normal
"The Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church (Estonian: Eesti Apostlik-Õigeusu Kirik; EOC) is an Orthodox church in Estonia under the direct jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. Under Estonian law it is the legal successor to the pre–World War II Estonian Orthodox Church, which in 1940 had over 210,000 faithful, three bishops, 156 parishes, 131 priests, 19 deacons, two monasteries, and a theological seminary; the majority of the faithful were ethnic Estonians. Its official name is the Orthodox Church of Estonia. The current primate of the church is Stephanos, Metropolitan of Tallinn and all Estonia, elected in 1999. Little is known about the history of the church in the area until the 17th and 18th centuries, when many Old Believers fled there from Russia to avoid the liturgical reforms introduced by Patriarch Nikon of Moscow. Autocephaly recognized by some autocephalous Churches de jure: Autocephaly and canonicity recognized by Constantinople and 3 other autocephalous Churches: Spiritual independence recognized by Georgian Orthodox Church: Semi-Autonomous: In the 18th and 19th centuries, Estonia was a part of the Russian Empire. In the 1850s a rumour spread that the Orthodox Church promised to provide everybody who converted to Orthodoxy a piece of land of their own somewhere in Russia. Some 65,000 Estonian peasants were converted to the Orthodox faith in the hope of obtaining land, and numerous Orthodox churches were built. Later, when the rumour turned out to be a hoax, a great part of the new Orthodox peasants returned to the Lutheran Church. In the late 19th century, a wave of Russification was introduced, supported by the Russian hierarchy but not by the local Estonian clergy. The Cathedral of St. Alexander Nevsky in Tallinn and the Pühtitsa (Pukhtitsa) convent in Kuremäe in East Estonia were also built around this time. After the Republic of Estonia was proclaimed in 1918, the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, St. Tikhon, in 1920 recognised the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church (EAOC) as being autonomous (Resolution No. 1780), postponing the discussion of its autocephaly. Archbishop Aleksander Paulus was elected and ordained Metropolitan of Tallinn and All Estonia, head of the EAOC. Prior to this, Soviet Russia had adopted a Marxist–Leninist ideology which held as an ideological goal the elimination of religion and its replacement with state atheism. In response, Patriarch Tikhon had excommunicated the Soviet leadership in 1918, leading to a period of intense persecution of the Russian Orthodox Church. In April 1922, Tikhon was imprisoned, and the Estonian clergy lost contact with the Moscow Patriarchate. In September 1922 the Council of the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church petitioned the Patriarch of Constantinople, Meletius IV, to (1) transfer control of the Estonian church from the Russian Orthodox Church to the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and (2) clarify the Estonian church's canonical status. In 1923 the Patriarchate of Constantinople issued a tomos (ecclesiastical edict) which brought the EAOC under Constantinople's jurisdiction and granted it autonomy, but not full autocephaly. Before 1941, one-fifth of the total Estonian population (who had been mostly Lutheran since the Reformation in the early 16th century when the country was controlled by the Teutonic Order) were Orthodox Christians under the Patriarchate of Constantinople. There were 158 parishes in Estonia and 183 clerics in the Estonian church. There was also a Chair of Orthodoxy in the Faculty of Theology at the University of Tartu. There was a Pskovo-Pechorsky Monastery in Petseri, two convents in Narva and Kuremäe, a priory in Tallinn and a seminary in Petseri. The ancient monastery in Petseri was preserved from the mass church destructions that occurred in Soviet Russia. In 1940, Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union, whose government undertook a general programme of the dissolution of all ecclesiastical independence within its territory. From 1942 to 1944, however, autonomy under Constantinople was temporarily revived. In 1945, a representative of the Moscow Patriarchate dismissed the members of the OCE synod who had remained in Estonia and established a new organisation, the Diocesan Council. Orthodox believers in occupied Estonia were thus subordinated to being a diocese within the Russian Orthodox Church. Just before the second Soviet occupation in 1944 and the dissolution of the Estonian synod, the primate of the church, Metropolitan Aleksander, went into exile along with 21 clergymen and about 8,000 Orthodox believers. The Orthodox Church of Estonia in Exile with its synod in Sweden continued its activity according to the canonical statutes, until the restoration of Estonian independence in 1991. Before he died in 1953, Metr. Aleksander established his community as an exarchate under Constantinople. Most of the other bishops and clergy who remained behind were deported to Siberia. In 1958, a new synod was established in exile, and the church was organized from Sweden. In 1978, at the urging of the Moscow Patriarchate, the Ecumenical Patriarch declared the charter (tomos) of the Church as granted in 1923, inoperative. The church ceased to exist until the breakup of the Soviet Union, when divisions within the Orthodox community in Estonia arose between those who claimed that the Moscow Patriarchate has no jurisdiction in Estonia and those who wished to return to the jurisdiction of Moscow. The dispute often took place along ethnic lines, as many Russians had immigrated to Estonia during the Soviet occupation. Lengthy negotiations between the two patriarchates failed to produce any agreement. In 1993, the synod of the Orthodox Church of Estonia in Exile was re-registered as the legal successor of the autonomous Orthodox Church of Estonia, and on February 20, 1996, the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I formally reactivated the tomos granted to the OCE in 1923, restoring its canonical subordination to the Ecumenical Patriarchate. This action brought immediate protest from the Estonian-born Patriarch Alexei II of the Moscow Patriarchate, which regarded the Estonian church as being part of its territory. The Patriarch of Moscow temporarily removed the name of the Ecumenical Patriarch from the diptychs. In this difficult situation, the Orthodox Church of Estonia received help and support from the Finnish Orthodox Church, especially from Archbishop Johannes (Rinne) of the Archdiocese of Karelia and All Finland and Auxiliary Bishop Ambrosius (Risto Jääskeläinen) of Joensuu. The Ecumenical Patriarchate decided that Archbishop Johannes, Bishop Ambrosius and pastor Heikki Huttunen from Espoo should be available to give help in the reconstruction of the newly restored church. Archbishop Johannes would temporarily act as a deputy metropolitan (1996–1999) of the Estonian Autonomous Church. An agreement was reached in which local congregations could choose which jurisdiction to follow. The Orthodox community in Estonia, which accounts for 16.15% of the total population, remains divided, with the majority of faithful (mostly ethnic Russians) remaining under Moscow. From a U.S. Department of State report released in November 2003, about 20,000 believers (mostly ethnic Estonians) in 60 parishes are part of the autonomous church, with 150,000 faithful in 31 parishes, along with the monastic community of Pühtitsa, paying allegiance to Moscow. In 1999, the church received a resident hierarch, Metropolitan Stephanos (Charalambides) of Tallinn, formerly an auxiliary bishop under the Ecumenical Patriarchate's Metropolitan of France.",Normal

"""Blackest Night"" is a 2009–10 American comic book crossover storyline published by DC Comics, consisting of an eponymous central miniseries, written by Geoff Johns and penciled by Ivan Reis, along with a number of tie-in issues. Blackest Night involves Nekron, a personified force of death who reanimates deceased superheroes and seeks to eliminate all life and emotion from the universe. Geoff Johns has identified the series' central theme as emotion. The crossover was published for eight months as a limited series and in both the Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps comic titles. Various other limited series and tie-ins, including an audio drama from Darker Projects, were published. The storyline was first mentioned at the conclusion of the ""Sinestro Corps War"" in Green Lantern (vol. 4) #25. As the war between the Green Lantern and Sinestro Corps reaches its climax, the four Green Lanterns of Earth—Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner, John Stewart, and Kyle Rayner—are told by the Guardians Ganthet and Sayd of the Blackest Night prophecy. According to the prophecy, the two existing Corps would be joined by five new ones, each driven by a specific emotion and empowered by a specific color of the emotional spectrum, leading to a ""War of Light"" that would subsequently destroy the universe. Johns says the prophecy has its origins in the story ""Tygers"" by Alan Moore, which touches on the rising up of the Guardians' enemies the Weaponers of Qward, Ranx the Sentient City, and the Children of the White Lobe, the destruction of the Green Lanterns, and shows Hal Jordan, Sinestro, and Mogo dying. Both Geoff Johns and Ethan Van Sciver said that Blackest Night is the third part of a Green Lantern event trilogy that began with Rebirth and continued with ""Sinestro Corps War"". In a December 2007 interview with IGN, Johns stated that he had the monthly Green Lantern book plotted up until issue #55. More details for the event were revealed in DC Universe #0, which depicted Black Hand discovering the black power battery on the planet of Ryut. Blackest Night #0 was released on May 2, 2009 — Free Comic Book Day — and portrays a series of events directly leading into Blackest Night #1. The standalone, self-titled miniseries consists of Blackest Night #0 and eight monthly issues. Tie-ins include issues of Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps starting with issues #43 and #38, respectively, and nine 3-issue limited series: Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps, Blackest Night: Superman, Blackest Night: Batman, Blackest Night: Titans, Blackest Night: Wonder Woman, Blackest Night: Flash, and Blackest Night: JSA. Ethan Van Sciver had planned to work on the opening book, but because of his work on The Flash: Rebirth miniseries he was not able to complete both effectively. Van Sciver and Ivan Reis, as well as Joe Prado created many of the designs for this storyline. Green Lanterns Ash and Saarek find the Black Central Battery at a reportedly classified location within Sector 666. After touching the battery, Saarek reports that their presence has awakened something. The two are killed when two monstrous hands emerge from below them as the battery calls ""flesh"". In Green Lantern Corps, a field of asteroids in an unknown region of space is depicted with the colors of the spectrum in the background. The asteroids, which are apparently the remains of the planet Xanshi, are shattered and a large quantity of black power rings move through them. In Gotham City, Black Hand removes Bruce Wayne's skull from his grave and carries it with him, and a Black Lantern power battery begins to charge. The Guardians of Oa observe the War of Light and realize that Ganthet and Sayd are correct, but are kept from intervening by Scar, who swiftly kills one and imprisons the rest. Thousands of black rings assault the Corps' crypt, creating a Black Lantern Corps. Hal Jordan and the newly revived Flash investigate Bruce Wayne's grave and are attacked by Black Lantern Martian Manhunter. On Oa, the Green Lanterns are met by all of the resurrected Lanterns, now reborn as Black Lanterns. Hawkgirl and Hawkman are killed by Black Lanterns Elongated Man and Sue Dibny and join the growing Black Corps. The Atom is tricked into visiting Black Lantern Hawkman, and Deadman is the first to realize the dead superheroes are not their true selves when his physical body revives as a Black Lantern while he is still free. Aquaman and his Black Lantern family, including Tempest, attack Mera, who flees. A black ring strikes the Spectre, binding the spirit Aztar and reviving Crispus Allen as a Black Lantern. The black rings are unable to revive dead characters who are at peace, such as former Dove Don Hall, even as his partner Hawk and his brother Hank rise. In Gotham, Hal Jordan and Barry Allen are confronted by several Black Lanterns, including Ronald Raymond. Hal, the Atom and Flash battle the Black Lanterns when the Indigo Tribe appear and use their Indigo power with other rings to obliterate the Black Dibnys. Mera finds the new (still human) Firestorm and Gehenna, who merge to create a new Firestorm. Indigo says that the Lantern Corps must unite to defeat the Black one. The Indigo Tribe depart with Hal and leave the other heroes to fight the invading Black Lanterns. Black Lantern Firestorm separates Jason and Gehenna, kills Gehenna, while taunting her how scared she was, and absorbs Jason's consciousness. Black rings revive the villains whose remains have been in storage in the Hall of Justice. Mera and Flash flee the Black Lanterns and use Atom's powers to escape through a telephone line. Flash leaves and gives all the superheroes in the US the key to defeat the Black Lanterns—merging lights with a Green Ring—and the Atom, Mera and the Justice Society of America battle many Lanterns together. Jean Loring kills and causes Damage to revive as a Lantern, which fully empowers the Black Lantern power battery. Barry arrives in Coast City, where Scar has teleported with the Black Central Power Battery. Black Hand then summons Nekron, who revives the residents of Coast City. The JLA, Wally West, the Teen Titans, and Bart Allen fight the Coast City Black Lanterns. Dove can destroy Black Lanterns with her presence. Hal and Lantern Corps members Carol Ferris, Sinestro, Atrocitus, Larfleeze, Saint Walker, Indigo-1, Ganthet, and Sayd return to Earth and attack Scar while she is attacking Wally West. Nekron has Batman's corpse—later revealed to be a clone briefly reanimated to gain a necessary connection—and sends rings to Superman, Wonder Woman, Superboy, Green Arrow, Kid Flash, Donna Troy, Ice, and Animal Man, previously killed and revived into Black Lantern members by Nekron as Hal and Barry try to outrace their rings. Allen time-travels himself and Jordan two seconds into the future and disables their rings. Mera and the Atom arrive. John Stewart warns Hal that every Black Lantern in the universe is heading for Earth. Jordan says they need the entire seven Corps to unite to produce White Light. While they summon the seven Corps to Earth, Ganthet duplicates the seven colored rings present and deputizes non-Corps members Ganthet as Green, Barry Allen as Blue, Lex Luthor as Orange, Scarecrow as Yellow, Atom as Indigo, Mera as Red, and Wonder Woman as Violet after separating her from her Black Ring. The Corps Leaders and deputies fight Nekron but cannot stop him, partly because Luthor is overwhelmed by the Orange light of avarice. John Stewart is trying to stop the horde of Black Lanterns when the combined Six Corps arrive to join and battle the Black Lanterns. In Coast City, Dove tries to reach the Black Lantern Battery but is forced to retreat as a being from within the battery tries to escape. Nekron kills a Guardian and uses his blood to cause a cocoon to emerge. Ganthet reveals that this is the White Light Entity that triggered existence and that life actually began on Earth, not Oa, and that the Guardians upheld the lie to protect the Entity and justify their power. Nekron stabs the Entity, causing living beings across the universe to feel pain, and Sinestro surrenders to his anger at Abin Sur's death and stabs Ganthet, much to Hal Jordan's chagrin. Hal realizes the Entity is like Parallax and Ion and needs a guide, and tries to merge with it, but is blocked by Sinestro, who is unhappy that Hal recently reused Parallax, who Sinestro feels he deserves. Sinestro demands the Entity's power, emerges and is told ""Thaal Sinestro of Korugar. Destiny awaits"". Sinestro is promptly killed by Nekron, but the White Ring revives him. Sinestro retaliates and kills Nekron, but Nekron's scythe is picked up by a Black Lantern human who transforms into Nekron and says ""death cannot be stopped"". Ganthet notes that Sinestro cannot properly control the Entity as it is being powered by Sinestro's ego rather than his will to live. The united Lantern Corps attacks Nekron. Deadman possesses Guy Gardner and explains that Black Hand is Nekron's tether and that he must be revived to defeat Nekron. Nekron separates Sinestro from the Entity and Hal says that Nekron opened the door to death but it was the decision of the heroes to live. Hal merges with the Entity and transforms himself and the Black Lantern heroes into a White Lantern Corps, who restore Black Hand to life. This causes Black Hand to regurgitate a White Ring which revives the Anti-Monitor trapped in the Black Lantern Power Battery. Nekron briefly fights the Anti-Monitor and banishes him to his home in Qward, the Antimatter Universe. Black Hand regurgitates a cluster of white rings that destroy Nekron. The rings bring only 12 Black Lanterns back to life: Maxwell Lord, Jade, the Hawk, Captain Boomerang, Firestorm (Ronald Raymond), the Martian Manhunter, Aquaman, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Osiris, Professor Zoom the Reverse-Flash, and Deadman (Boston Brand). Upon seeing Aquaman alive, Mera's love causes her ring to depart and shatter, sending her into cardiac arrest. Star Sapphire and Saint Walker join their powers together to restore her, and Aquaman and Mera share a joyful reunion. Hawkgirl recalls her past lives, removes her helmet to reveal that she is again Shiera Hall and embraces Hawkman. Superman expresses his happiness that J'onn has returned. Firestorm forcibly separates into Ronald Raymond and Jason, the latter is angry that Ronald has killed his girlfriend. As Mera comforts Jason, Ronald is confused and asks Atom what is happening and where Professor Stein is. Guy lets Lord, who is controlling his mind, escape. Jade kisses Kyle, unaware he is in love with fellow Green Lantern Soranik Natu. Osiris is confused and says he wants to go home. Superboy and Kid Flash, who only knows him by name, try to figure out who he is. After Professor Zoom flees into the past, Flash knocks out Captain Boomerang, while saying bloody hell to him. Barry notes that Ralph and Sue Dibny have not been revived. Deadman, the only one of the resurrected still wearing a White Ring, is stunned to realize he is alive and something is wrong. Larfleeze returns an unconscious Lex Luthor stripped of his ring, who briefly realizes that he has given something away, and demands that Sayd honors her debt to him. Ganthet protests but Sayd tells him all is well and believes she can somehow help Larfleeze. Sayd says the future of the Lantern Corps must be discussed. Saint Walker notices that the Indigo Tribe and Black Hand are missing. On the Indigo home world, Black Hand is now a member and prisoner of the Indigo Tribe, and is chained to an indigo power staff. Hal and Barry realize that because Black Lantern Batman was a fake, Bruce Wayne is still alive somewhere. Barry wonders what became of the Entity; Hal says it is still out there, urging them all to move past the events of the Blackest Night. Elsewhere, on a distant road, a White Power Battery is found in a crater. Following the end of Blackest Night, DC launched Brightest Day, a 25-issue bi-weekly comic book written by Geoff Johns and Peter Tomasi. Also, Action Comics features a story arc in which Lex Luthor starts a universal quest to locate the power sources of the Black Lantern Corps after being infused with the Orange Light of Avarice. The series and its tie-in issues have been collected into a number of volumes: The series has received generally positive reviews. Comic Book Resources gave the first and third issues in the series 5 out of 5 stars, and the second received 4.5 stars. IGN also reviewed the series favorably, and rated the first three individual issues between 8.7 and 9.3 out of a possible 10. In Tales from the Dark Multiverse: Blackest Night, an alternate outcome to Blackest Night is depicted where Sinestro's ego refused to release his control of the Entity, with the result that all life was destroyed by the Black Lanterns. By the time of the storyline, a few weeks after Nekron's attack, the only living beings in the universe are Sinestro, Lobo, Dove, and Mister Miracle, and Sinestro is only half-alive because the Entity keeps him going even as he wears a Black ring at the same time. Mister Miracle is able to find a means of channelling the Source Wall through Dove to recreate the universe, but when Nekron - now possessing Darkseid - reveals that this will literally remake the universe over, Mister Miracle kills Dove as he cannot bring himself to erase Barda from existence, which causes Lobo to kill Mister Miracle in retribution for killing the only thing in the universe he considered ""pure"". As a last resort, Sinestro uses Lobo to channel the life energy into the universe, but this only results in the creation of a more twisted form of 'life' that follows Lobo's example by trying to destroy all remnants of the old existence and their own enemies, leaving Sinestro fighting to escape this world even as higher entities keep him contained so that he cannot contaminate other realities.",Normal

"""I Can't Stay Mad at You"" is a song written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King. It was originally recorded by American country artist Skeeter Davis, becoming her second top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1963. ""I Can't Stay Mad at You"" followed on the popular success of Davis' earlier 1963 crossover hit ""The End of the World"". The song was one of the first Goffin-King compositions to be recorded by a country music performer. ""I Can't Stay Mad at You"" was written by songwriting duo Gerry Goffin and Carole King. They had previously enjoyed pop successes as songwriters, including ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"" and ""Take Good Care of My Baby"". King would eventually embark on a successful recording career in the early 1970s. The song was recorded in April 1963 in Nashville, Tennessee at the RCA Victor Studio, alongside producer Chet Atkins. Six other songs were recorded during the session, including a cover of ""I Will Follow Him"". According to Allmusic critic Richie Unterberger, ""I Can't Stay Mad at You"" was recorded in the popular ""girl group"" musical style. It included heavy choruses backed by a ""wall-of-sound"" that the Goffin-King pair was used to writing songs for. Unterberger also explains that the song displays similarities to Neil Sedaka's pop hit ""Breaking Up Is Hard to Do"", stating ""'I Can't Stay Mad at You' begins with a whole verse worth of ultra-catchy doo wop syllables ('Shooby Dooby Doo Bob') that, frankly, is highly reminiscent of the similar patterns used in Neil Sedaka's No. 1 1962 hit 'Breaking Up Is Hard to Do' (written by Sedaka and Howard Greenfield). In fact, the whole song is fairly reminiscent of that previous Sedaka hit, though 'I Can't Stay Mad at You' is, to its credit, a little brighter and more exuberant."" The song features a string section featuring violins being played in a high register. In August 1963, ""I Can't Stay Mad at You"" was officially released as a single by RCA Victor, with the b-side being ""It Was Only a Heart"". As a country music artist, the song became Davis' twelfth top-twenty hit on the Billboard Hot Country Singles, peaking at number fourteen. The record was an even bigger hit on the pop charts, becoming Davis' second top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching a peak of number seven in 1963. The second peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks The song would become Davis' last single to enter the Billboard Pop top-forty, as her follow-up singles would reach progressively-lower positions on the chart in the later months and years. ""I Can't Stay Mad at You"" was later issued onto Davis' studio album Let Me Get Close to You in 1964. The B side ""It Was Only a Heart"" also received pop airplay and peaked at No. 92 on the Billboard Hot 100.  (Uncredited) String section featuring violins in the high register.",Normal

It is the first in Toronto capable of accommodating the production of large-scale films. The studio is named for the British Pinewood Studios Group. In March 2018, it was announced that Bell Media would be buying a controlling stake in the studio. It is located across the shipping channel from Hearn Generating Station along Commissioners Street. The project covers 4.5 hectares (11 acres) of land in the Port Lands area of Toronto, a former industrial area, that is already home to a number of smaller studios. The Port Lands site was originally a brownfield site owned by Imperial Oil, and required considerable cleanup prior to reuse. Initial work on the complex began in August 2006. In June 2009, the studio entered into a comprehensive sales and marketing agreement with the Pinewood Studios Group, resulting in the facility being renamed Pinewood Toronto Studios. Pinewood Toronto Studios was constructed to be a ""green"" facility with a number of environmental considerations. In March 2018, Bell Media reached a deal with the UK-based Pinewood studios group, the City of Toronto government, and several holdings companies to purchase a controlling stake in the studio. As part of the deal, Bell Media announced that an additional 170,000 square feet of sound stages would be built at Pinewood Toronto to ease scarcity of production space in Toronto. The 11-hectare lot features seven purpose-built sound stages and one converted warehouse, ranging from 10,000 square feet (930m2) to 46,000 square feet (4,300m2). The largest sound stage, called the Mega Stage, is more than 46,000 square feet (4,300m2) and until 2016, was the largest purpose-built sound stage in North America.

"Ultra Fractal is a fractal generation and rendering software application. The program was the first publicly available fractal software which featured layering methods previously only found in image editing software. Because of this, the program has become popular for use in the creation of fractal art. Ultra Fractal is commercial software, but an evaluation version is freely available. The unregistered version creates watermarked renders. Ultra Fractal is raster based. The program works using a similar paradigm to Photoshop, allowing multiple layers to be combined using layer blending modes, transformations, and custom fractal formulas. Fractal formulas, coloring algorithms, and transformations may be written by users, and a large number of such formula files are available in a public formula database. Fractals may be copied from the interface and pasted as plain text into an email. There is a busy mailing list on which many users post their parameter sets. Calculation using arbitrary precision arithmetic is supported, allowing users to zoom to a magnification of 104000. The GUI is customizable with a dockable MDI. The software calculates statistics about the fractal that is being previewed. Other features include fullscreen mode, color cycling, a render queue, distributed rendering calculations, and a detailed help file. Version 4 added support for animations and improved flame fractal rendering. Formulae from Fractint, an early and widely used piece of fractal-generating software, have been converted to an UltraFractal formula file. This graphics software–related article is a stub.

"I Remember Better When I Paint is a feature length international documentary film about the positive impact of art and other creative therapies in people with Alzheimer's disease and how these approaches can change the way the disease is viewed by society. The film examines the way creative arts bypass the limitations of dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's and shows how patients' still-vibrant imaginations are strengthened through therapeutic art. The film is by Eric Ellena and Berna Huebner, and is narrated by actress Olivia de Havilland. It features an interview with Yasmin Aga Khan, president of Alzheimer's Disease International and daughter of Rita Hayworth, who had Alzheimer's, describing how her mother took up painting while struggling with the disease. The inspiration for the film is the story of Hilda Goldblatt Gorenstein (Hilgos), who had Alzheimer's. As she painted, Hilgos’s mobility and speech began to improve as did her quality of life. The documentary includes interviews with renowned neurologists who explain how creative activities engage areas of the brain that are not damaged by the disease and thus reawaken a sense of personality, identity and dignity. Doctors interviewed include Robert Neil Butler, founding director of the National Institute of Aging; Sam Gandy of Mount Sinai Medical Center; Gene D. Cohen of George Washington University; Robert Green and Bob Stern of Boston University; and Avertano Noronha of the University of Chicago. The film demonstrates the intersection between the arts, medical and scientific worlds. The film was selected for the 2016 Flager Film Festival, the 2010 Rhode Island International Film Festival and the 2009 Bel Air Film Festival. In 2014 and 2015, the film broadcast nationwide on public television stations in the United States during November Alzheimer's Awareness month. I Remember Better When I Paint has been released as part of a DVD package which includes the documentary and a series of short supplemental films that further highlight special programs and flesh out the how-tos of organizing an outing, a creative workshop or recreating social bonds between people with Alzheimer's and their families. The documentary's Twitter was named a 2015 finalist in the charity category of the Shorty Awards, an annual event that honors the best in social media. From the seven finalists, the 2015 Shorty Award for the best in charity was awarded to the Gates Foundation.

"Gunnison's prairie dog (Cynomys gunnisoni) is one of five species of prairie dog. This species belongs to the squirrel family of rodents, and are predominantly related to the North American and Eurasian ground squirrels. Gunnison's prairie dogs are primarily distributed in the Four Corners region of the United States. Gunnison's prairie dogs are 12 to 14 inches (30 to 36cm) in length and have tails that measure 1.25 to 2.25 inches (3.2 to 5.7cm). This species weighs from 1.5 to 2.5lb (0.68 to 1.13kg). On average, males are larger in size than females. Gunnison's prairie dogs have 22 teeth, and five pairs of mammary glands. The Gunnison's prairie dog, C. gunnisoni, is the only prairie dog species that has 40 chromosomes. The other four species, black-tailed, white-tailed, Utah, and Mexican prairie dogs, have 50 chromosomes. Their coats are yellow-toned buff merged with black-colored hairs. The upper head, sides of the cheek, and eyebrows are distinctly darker than the rest of the body. Their tails are mostly white with grayish-white ends and the tips are light gray. The Gunnison's prairie dogs go through two yearly periodic moults during spring and fall. In spring, the shedding begins from the head to the rear tail. The process is reversed in the winter, it starts from the tail and proceeds to head. A distinguishing physical trait of the prairie dog is the placement of the eyes. They are situated on the sides of their heads, giving them a wide peripheral range of sight. This allows them to spot predators more easily and react as quickly as possible. The Gunnison's prairie dog typically feeds during the day, when they are most active. Their diet usually consists of grasses, herbs, and leaves. During the spring, they feed on newly grown shrubs. In the summer, they mainly consume seeds. Food is scarce in winter and fall. During these months, they feed on stems and roots, and stored food accumulated in the warmer months. While most prairie dogs are typically herbivores, some eat insects. Three-quarters of the population of Gunnison's prairie dogs are located in Arizona and New Mexico. They can be found in high desert, grasslands, meadows, hillsides, broad alluvial valleys and floodplains. They are often found in shrubs, such as rabbitbrush, sagebrush, and saltbrush. This species of prairie dogs resides in habitats ranging from 6,000–10,000 feet (1,800–3,000m) in altitude, although they have been recorded at altitudes as high as 12,000 feet (3,700m). The sagebrush ecosystem is dependent on these animals. As a result of the Gunnison's prairie dogs burrowing, the soil is freshened, organic matter is added, and increased water penetration is able to occur. Their burrowing also creates habitats and exposes food sources for other creatures. Gunnison's prairie dogs live in colonies of up to several hundred individuals. Each colony is subdivided into smaller territories occupied by communal groups or solitary individuals. These communities of prairie dogs vary from two to 19 individuals and may be composed of a single malesingle female, single malemultiple females, or multiple malesmultiple females. Arrangement of the communities or social groups may be linked with the distribution of food resources. The territories inhabited by the Gunnison's prairie dog are defended by social groups, and violent behavior is common toward other animals who are not members. These prairie dogs often feed in feebly defended peripheral sections of territories that belong to other groups, but when members from different groups meet in these common feeding areas, conflicts can arise, with one prairie dog chasing the other back to its territory. All prairie dogs, including the Gunnison's prairie dog, are diurnal. This means they exert the most activity in the early morning and late afternoon. During warm weather, the highest activity levels occur at about 9 a.m., and from 2 p.m. to about an hour before the sunsets. When the temperature starts to cool, they become more active during the day. When it snows or rains, the prairie dogs will stay underground. Their above-ground activities include making social contact, being aware of their surroundings and predators, grooming, burrowing, etc. Their main activity above ground is feeding. Although Gunnison's prairie dogs are considered to be less social than black-tailed prairie dogs, they are considered to be more social than the white-tailed prairie dogs. Studies have shown female Gunnison's prairie dogs are far more likely to engage in friendly social contact with other prairie dogs, and males are more likely to create conflict. With the exception of two species, the black-tailed and Mexican, prairie dogs hibernate. During the winter, the Gunnison's prairie dog stays underground for long periods of time without food or water, using physiological adaptations to control their metabolism. Their bodies also rely on their stored body fat during hibernation. After hibernation, they become active again around March or April. This species is most active during the months of April through October. The Gunnison's prairie dog communicates through forms of physical contact, such as cuddling and kissing, and through vocalization, such as a warning bark. Their vocal communication is the foundation to their survival and structure of their community. Their system of vocal communication is complex and may be one of the most advanced forms of communication of all-natural animal languages. Con Slobodchikoff, a Northern Arizona University biology professor, has been researching the behavior of prairie dogs for 20 years, and states prairie dogs ""have one of the most advanced forms of natural language known to science."" The bark is a combination of one or two high-pitched audible syllables, with the second syllable lower and deeper. Prairie dogs have a unique sound to identify each of various predators. They also have different barks for warning and ""all-clear"" signals. Researchers and experts have been able to classify up to 11 distinct warning call the prairie dog uses to communicate. Also, females with offspring are more likely to give off a warning bark than males. The warning signal is their primary source of survival because it alerts the other prairie dogs to nearby danger. It can last for up to 30 minutes and can be heard nearly a mile away. As danger approaches, the intensity of the signal increases, and it ends after the prairie dog has entered its safe haven. Studies have also shown prairie dogs can distinguish between the different colors of clothing people wear, and between people expressing threatening and nonthreatening behavior. The Gunnison's prairie dog mating season begins in mid-March and lasts until mid-May. A female is able to reproduce at the age of one year. When food availability is scarce during the mating season, they may wait another year before breeding. Females can only engage in sexual intercourse for a single day during the mating season, and can mate with approximately five males, depending on the population density of their habitat. Gestation lasts, on average, 30 days. Copulation usually occurs underground. Females produce one litter per year of four to five pups. Once the pups are born, the mother Gunnison's prairie dog nurses the pups for about 30 to 40 days. During this time, the young pups remain safely in the nesting burrow located underground. Towards the end of lactation, the young are able to come out above ground; they must learn how to separate themselves from their mothers and survive on their own. As soon as the mother is done caring her young, she relocates herself to another burrow, leaving her now-independent young behind. Not too long after, they scatter to other vacant burrows. A high percentage of female Gunnison's prairie dogs settle close to their birth territories for their entire lifetimes, whereas a significantly low percentage of the males stay close to their birth territories for longer than one year. The life span of a Gunnison's prairie dog is generally three to five years in the wild, but they can live up to eight years of age. The population of the Gunnison's prairie dog is declining drastically due to three major factors: shootings, plague cycles, and poisoning. Many concerned groups of people are requesting that the Gunnison's Prairie Dog be listed under the federal Endangered Species Act. Predators include badgers, wolves, coyotes, bobcats, black-footed ferrets, weasels, golden eagles and large hawks. Humans also affect prairie dog populations; for example, some ranchers implement poisoning programs to eliminate them. Plague (disease), caused by Yersinia pestis and transmitted via fleas, can wipe out numerous individuals of the prairie dog populations.",Normal

"The Ponte della Maddalena was a bridge on the south east of Naples, Italy, spanning over what was once the River Sebeto, and now reflected by the path of the Via Marinella. For centuries it was one of the entry points into Naples from the South, but was obliterated during the late 19th-century urban renewal of the city. Prior to Norman times, the bridge was known as pons padulis. Then it was named Guizzardo bridge, for a bridge built by Robert Guiscard, Duke of Puglia, when he lay siege to the city in 1078. It stood near the shoreline to the east of the city where the Via Marinella crossed the River Sebeto (within the present-day Vittorio Emanuele III docks and Piazza Mercato). The bridge was rebuilt in 1555 under the Viceroy Don Bernardino di Mendoza, to span the marsh ground where the Sebeto river arose during the rainy season. The bridge was rebuilt again in 1747 under Charles III and once again in the second half of the 19th century. No longer in existence, it was an established and popular vantage point for topographical artists. The bridge was an excellent point at which to deny entry to invading forces into the city. The most famous of these was the stand in 1799 of the forces of the short-lived Neapolitan republic against the returning royalist Bourbon army. The Miracle of the Magdalene bridge recalls an incident in December 1631, when the cardinal of Naples, led a procession dedicated to San Gennaro to the bridge to plead for the end to an eruption of Vesuvius. The ebbing of the eruption was interpreted as a miraculous intercession. A shrine was erected in 1777 with San Gennaro with his arms pacifying the volcano. 40°50′43″N 14°16′41″E﻿ ﻿40.84529°N 14.27793°E﻿ 40.84529; 14.27793 This article about a bridge in Italy is a stub.

"William Aditya Sarana (born 2 May 1996) is an Indonesian politician of the Indonesian Solidarity Party who currently serves as a member of the Jakarta Regional House of Representatives. He is head of his party's faction within the legislature. Sarana was born on 2 May 1996 in Jakarta. His father is a legal advocate. He is of Chinese Indonesian descent, and is a Protestant. He studied at the Dian Harapan High School in Daan Mogot, West Jakarta, and later studied law at the University of Indonesia (UI). In 2018, as an UI student, he petitioned the Constitutional Court of Indonesia for a judicial review of the Terrorism Law of 2018, raising concerns over the law's definition of ""radicalism"". He took part in a student exchange program to the University of Malaya. Sarana was elected into the Jakarta Regional House of Representatives following the 2019 Indonesian legislative election after winning 12,295 votes, representing the 9th electoral district (Kalideres, Cengkareng, and Tambora districts). According to Sarana, he avoided areas known as bases of support for Anies Baswedan during his campaign due to poor reception there, and instead he focused on areas known to support Basuki Tjahaja Purnama in the 2017 gubernatorial election. When he was sworn in on 26 August 2019, he was 23, making him the youngest member of the legislature. He would graduate from UI on 30 August 2019, after he became a legislator. At the beginning of his tenure, Sarana publicly denounced several unusual items in the annual budget – namely, Rp 82 billion (~USD 6 million) item for glue and Rp 124 billion (~USD 9 million) item for ballpoints. He was later given a reprimand by the legislature's ethical body for violating the budgetary process through the public statement. The municipal government attributed the budget items to an input mistake. Following the departure of PSI's faction head Anggara Wicitra Sastroamidjojo to the National Mandate Party, Sarana became PSI's faction head.

"Hillingdon tube station is a London Underground station in North Hillingdon in the London Borough of Hillingdon, West London. Located between Uxbridge and Ickenham, it is in Travelcard Zone 6. It is the penultimate station on the Uxbridge branch of both the Metropolitan line and the Piccadilly line. Resited in 1992, it is also the most recently constructed station on the Metropolitan line. The Metropolitan Railway (Harrow & Uxbridge Railway) constructed the line between Harrow on the Hill and Uxbridge; this was opened on 4 July 1904, with an intermediate station at Ruislip. At first services were operated by steam trains, before electrification was completed on 1 January 1905. Development in north Middlesex over the next two decades led to the opening of additional stations to encourage the growth of new residential areas. Hillingdon was the last of these to open, on 10 December 1923, with Metropolitan and District line services. On 23 October 1933, the District line service was replaced by the Piccadilly line. Between the mid-1930s and the mid-1950s the station was named Hillingdon (Swakeleys), a name which is still displayed on the platform roundels. The goods yard closed in August 1964. To enable the widening of the A40 (Western Avenue) at Hillingdon Circus, the old station was demolished and a new station built to the south. Designed by architects Cassidy Taggart Partnership in a deconstructivism design, the new station opened to the south of the original on 6 December 1992. Widely acclaimed, the station received a 1996 Civic Trust Award for its design and the 1994 Underground Station of the Year award. The station was identified in July 2011 as one of the London Borough of Hillingdon's locally listed buildings. The station has a car park and is accessible for those with disabilities without using stairs or escalators. It is staffed, but the ticket office was closed in July 2015. Next-train indicators were installed in the ticket hall and on both platforms during May 2016; this coincided with works aimed at improving the station, including cleaning the glass station canopy and sealing off areas of the roof to deter nesting birds. In September 2019, a fight on the platform led to the murder of 20 year old Tashan Daniel. His two assailants were convicted of murder and manslaughter.

"Get ready for Brexit was a campaign launched by the British government on 2 September 2019. It encouraged the public to prepare for the UK leaving the European Union (EU) on 31 October. It ran across television, social media, billboards and other platforms and was the largest government public information campaign in British history. The Times reported on 30 August 2019 that a taxpayer-funded advertising campaign was under development which would cost up to £100 million. An advertising industry source said that the figure was ""substantially higher"" than the amount spent on traditional advertising in the UK by brands such as Amazon, Tesco and Asda in 2018. An order was placed for branded merchandise and there were claims that the government considered using the Vote Leave slogan 'take back control'. The campaign was developed by Engine Group who were appointed following Boris Johnson's election in the 2019 Conservative Party leadership contest. Manning Gottlieb OMD were hired to handle the campaign's media buying. The Get ready for Brexit campaign went live on 2 September 2019, stating that the UK would be leaving the EU on 31 October and urging the public to visit a new website, gov.ukbrexit, to see what they needed to do to prepare for it. In announcing the campaign's arrival, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said that ""Ensuring an orderly Brexit is not only a matter of national importance, but a shared responsibility."" The Get ready for Brexit slogan appeared for the first time on an advertising screen next to a John Lewis store at the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, East London. An image showing one of the campaign's billboards was issued by the Cabinet Office in the week beginning 2 September 2019. #GetReadyForBrexit was the fourth highest UK Twitter trend on the morning of 2 September 2019. Pro-Brexit campaigners drew comparison with the leaflets delivered to every house in the UK during the 2016 referendum by David Cameron's government in support of remaining in the EU. Further into September, a cross-party group of MPs led by Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson wrote to Sir Mark Sedwill, the head of the Civil Service, condemning the Get ready for Brexit campaign as ""redundant and misleading"". They urged Sedwill to intervene to ""make clear the UK is highly unlikely to leave without a deal"" on 31 October 2019, saying: ""A publicly funded campaign, encouraging businesses to be ready for the UK’s October no-deal exit, as well as being factually incorrect (as it addressed an event which could not occur) is inherently party political (as it cannot be government policy, but is Conservative policy), bringing the campaign into conflict."" As the campaign did not acknowledge the Benn Act, which rules out leaving the EU without a deal, it was described by opposition MPs as an election campaign rather than a campaign for public information. The pro-Remain group Led by Donkeys held a public competition to redesign the government posters, satirising the Brexit situation. The advertising campaign continued throughout September and October 2019 even as it appeared increasing unlikely the 31 October deadline would be met. Around a week before the end of October it was reported the government had ended the campaign though this turned out to be untrue. The campaign was paused on 28 October, three days before the UK was supposed to leave, after Boris Johnson accepted the EU's offer to extend the withdrawal process until 31 January 2020. In January 2020, the National Audit Office reported that the government had spent £46 million on the Get Ready for Brexit campaign in October 2019. The auditors concluded that ""it is not clear that the campaign resulted in the public being significantly better prepared"".",Normal

"Harold Russell Maddock (11 March 1918 – 8 June 2014) was an Australian-born jockey who rode in Queensland, NSW and Victoria. His overseas itinerary included Singapore, Malaya, France, Sweden, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Maddock was born in Brisbane and began his career as an apprentice in 1934 and in 1936 rode his first winner ""Camogean"" at only his 2nd ride in a race, in Toowoomba, a provincial city about 80 miles west of Brisbane. He was apprenticed to a horsetrainer named Mitchell. He became one of the top Australian jockeys with many jockey's premierships to his name. In 1959 he was named ""Jockey of the Century"" during the Queensland Centennial. In Australia he rode the great ""Sefiona"", High Rank"", ""Timor"", Earlwood"", ""Auction"", ""Proletaire"", to name but a few. Despite regular attempts to tempt him overseas he remained in Brisbane until a short venture to Malaysia in 1960 followed by a contract in the United Kingdom saw him move to horseracing Utopia. He settled into the UK racing scene quickly with a win at his first ride in the UK at Aintree on Mix n Match in the Earl of Sefton Plate on 25 March 1961 and the wins soon mounted up. He was successful in the UK and France. A few of the horses he was associated with in the UK are ""The Pouncer"", ""Althrey Don"", ""Mountain Call"", ""Laureate"" and ""Park Top"". In 1969 he was injured in a race fall at Newbury and after recovery broke the same leg in a training accident prior to his return to racing. It was the end of his career but he continued to live in the UK at his London home. His wife Brenda Pitt Maddock (from a family (Grenier and Pitt) involved in Qld racing since the 1840s) an artist continued her painting career and both daughters were on UK stage and TV and finally in 1981 he returned to Queensland and settled on the Gold Coast where he retired. He is buried in Brisbane's Toowong Cemetery and is in the council record search as Harold.",Normal

"In physics, a center of gravity of a material body is a point that may be used for a summary description of gravitational interactions. In a uniform gravitational field, the center of mass serves as the center of gravity. This is a very good approximation for smaller bodies near the surface of Earth, so there is no practical need to distinguish ""center of gravity"" from ""center of mass"" in most applications, such as engineering and medicine. In a non-uniform field, gravitational effects such as potential energy, force, and torque can no longer be calculated using the center of mass alone. In particular, a non-uniform gravitational field can produce a torque on an object, even about an axis through the center of mass. The center of gravity seeks to explain this effect. Formally, a center of gravity is an application point of the resultant gravitational force on the body. Such a point may not exist, and if it exists, it is not unique. One can further define a unique center of gravity by approximating the field as either parallel or spherically symmetric. The concept of a center of gravity as distinct from the center of mass is rarely used in applications, even in celestial mechanics, where non-uniform fields are important. Since the center of gravity depends on the external field, its motion is harder to determine than the motion of the center of mass. The common method to deal with gravitational torques is a field theory. One way to define the center of gravity of a body is as the unique point in the body if it exists, that satisfies the following requirement: There is no torque about the point for any positioning of the body in the field of force in which it is placed. This center of gravity exists only when the force is uniform, in which case it coincides with the center of mass. This approach dates back to Archimedes. When a body is affected by a non-uniform external gravitational field, one can sometimes define a center of gravity relative to that field that will act as a point where the gravitational force is applied. Textbooks such as The Feynman Lectures on Physics characterize the center of gravity as a point about which there is no torque. In other words, the center of gravity is a point of application for the resultant force. Under this formulation, the center of gravity rcg is defined as a point that satisfies the equation where F and τ are the total force and torque on the body due to gravity. One complication concerning rcg is that its defining equation is not generally solvable. If F and τ are not orthogonal, then there is no solution; the force of gravity does not have a resultant and cannot be replaced by a single force at any point. There are some important special cases where F and τ are guaranteed to be orthogonal, such as if all forces lie in a single plane or are aligned with a single point. If the equation is solvable, there is another complication: its solutions are not unique. Instead, there are infinitely many solutions; the set of all solutions is known as the line of action of the force. This line is parallel to the weight F. In general, there is no way to choose a particular point as the unique center of gravity. A single point may still be chosen in some special cases, such as if the gravitational field is parallel or spherically symmetric. These cases are considered below. Some of the inhomogeneity in a gravitational field may be modeled by a variable but parallel field: g(r) = g(r)n, where n is some constant unit vector. Although a non-uniform gravitational field cannot be exactly parallel, this approximation can be valid if the body is sufficiently small. The center of gravity may then be defined as a certain weighted average of the locations of the particles composing the body. Whereas the center of mass averages over the mass of each particle, the center of gravity averages over the weight of each particle: where wi is the (scalar) weight of the ith particle and W is the (scalar) total weight of all the particles. This equation always has a unique solution, and in the parallel-field approximation, it is compatible with the torque requirement. A common illustration concerns the Moon in the field of the Earth. Using the weighted-average definition, the Moon has a center of gravity that is lower (closer to the Earth) than its center of mass, because its lower portion is more strongly influenced by the Earth's gravity. This eventually lead to the Moon always showing the same face, a phenomenon known as tidal locking. If the external gravitational field is spherically symmetric, then it is equivalent to the field of a point mass M at the center of symmetry r. In this case, the center of gravity can be defined as the point at which the total force on the body is given by Newton's Law: where G is the gravitational constant and m is the mass of the body. As long as the total force is nonzero, this equation has a unique solution, and it satisfies the torque requirement. A convenient feature of this definition is that if the body is itself spherically symmetric, then rcg lies at its center of mass. In general, as the distance between r and the body increases, the center of gravity approaches the center of mass. Another way to view this definition is to consider the gravitational field of the body; then rcg is the apparent source of gravitational attraction for an observer located at r. For this reason, rcg is sometimes referred to as the center of gravity of M relative to the point r. The centers of gravity defined above are not fixed points on the body; rather, they change as the position and orientation of the body changes. This characteristic makes the center of gravity difficult to work with, so the concept has little practical use. When it is necessary to consider a gravitational torque, it is easier to represent gravity as a force acting at the center of mass, plus an orientation-dependent couple. The latter is best approached by treating the gravitational potential as a field.",Normal

"Wicd, which stands for Wireless Interface Connection Daemon, is an open-source software utility to manage both wireless and wired networks for Linux. The project started in late 2006 with the creation of Connection Manager, which eventually became Wicd. Wicd aims to provide a simple interface to connect to networks with a wide variety of settings. Wicd will only automatically connect to wireless networks you have specified and will not automatically connect to an unknown network. Wicd supports wireless encryption using wpa_supplicant. Users can design their own ""templates"", which can be used by Wicd to connect to a large variety of networks using any type of encryption wpa_supplicant supports. Wicd is split into two major components: the daemon, and the user interface. These two components communicate via D-Bus. This design allows the user interface to run as a standard user, and the daemon to run as the root user, so the user can change the wireless network without knowing the root password. The split interfacedaemon design would also allow a person to write a new front-end to the Wicd daemon, such as wicd-qt. There are also other front-ends available for many DEs such as GNOME, Xfce, and Fluxbox. Wicd is currently available in some Linux distributions, such as Debian, Gentoo Linux, Slackware, Ubuntu and Zenwalk Linux. This Linux-related article is a stub.

"Lambert le Bègue, also called Lambert li Bègues, (English: Lambert the Stutterer) was a priest and reformer, who lived in Liège, Belgium, in the middle of the 12th century. Whether he was named ""le Bègue"" (the ""Stammerer"") because of some speech problem is not known. The son of poor people, he was ordained priest sometime before 1164, and was first in charge of a church affiliated with the cathedral in Liège, probably St. Martin-en-Île. He refused to pay an increase in the annual tribute to the collegiate chapter of St. Pauls' and was reassigned to the smaller chapel of St. Christopher on the outskirts of the city. At the diocesan synod of 1166 he spoke out against the abuses of the clergy, protesting against simony, the ordination of sons of priests, and certain customs in the administration of the Sacrament of Baptism and the celebration of Mass. He ascribed greater importance to the devout mind and practical love of one's neighbor than to means of grace and sacraments. He founded in Liège the hospital of St. Christopher. In time he gathered about him a popular following, for whom he translated into the vernacular (French) the Life of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Life of St Agnes, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Epistles of St. Paul, with commentaries; these translations unfortunately have not been preserved. The foundation of such groups reflected the general flowering of the religious life among the laity in the towns of northern Europe during the late Middle Ages. The communities of beguines also served as refuges for women left widowed or unmarried by the participation of large numbers of men in the Crusades. The members frequently lived in individual apartments in a large, separately enclosed section of town called the beguinage. They renounced their goods and lived a semi-conventual life, but took no vows and followed none of the approved monastic rules. They dressed in distinctive costumes and spent their days in prayer, education, care of the sick, and work such as weaving. But he also had adversaries, especially among the clergy, and it was to refute them that he wrote a defense of his theories, entitled ""Antigraphum Petri"". His writings reveal him a man very learned for his time. They abound with quotations, not only from the Bible, but also from the Fathers of the Church, such as St. Gregory, St. Augustine and St. Bernard, and even from profane authors like Ovid, Virgil and Cicero. Accused of heresy, he was condemned and imprisoned notwithstanding his appeal to the Holy See. He escaped and went over to the antipope Callistus III, who had been recognized by Raoul of Zahringen, Prince-Bishop (i.e. bishop and secular ruler) of Liège. He wrote to the Pope several letters in justification of his doctrines and conduct, with the pope supporting him. In all probability he returned to Liège where he died in 1177. Walter Simons points out that the belief that he founded the beguines did not arise until the mid-thirteenth century, and discounts it as beguines did not begin to appear in Liège until sometime after his death. The Rue Lambert-le-Bègue is situated in the old district of the beguines in Liège.",Normal

Küppers attended the Hermann Lietz School in Haubinda and published a first volume of poems from there in 1907. After his father's company went bankrupt, he moved to Hamm. In 1909 he began studying art history at the Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich, with Heinrich Wölfflin among others. In 1909 he became active in the Corps Isaria. There in 1911 he met Sophie Schneider; they married in 1916. To continue his studies, he went to the Eberhard-Karls-University, where he was reciprocated on 1 November 1910 (with Otto Springorum) in the Corps Rhenania Tübingen. When he was inactive, he moved to the Christian Albrechts University in Kiel. Sick of tuberculosis, he spent a year of convalescence in the Black Forest. He then studied the panel paintings by Domenico Ghirlandaio at the Art History Institute in Florence. Engaged since 1913, Küppers wrote his doctoral thesis on Ghirlandaio in Kiel. From there he finally went to Hanover, where he initially assisted the later museum director Albert Brinckmann in the numismatic cabinet of the Kestner Museum. Shortly before his wedding in September 1916, in the middle of the First World War, Küppers became a co-founder of the Kestner Society, an institution established to introduce new, innovative artists in the city of Hannover, on 10 June 1916, chaired by Albert Brinckmann. Küppers was the first director of the Kestner Society (Kestner-Gesellschaft). Despite the war and economically difficult times, Küppers managed a successful art exhibition of modern and contemporary art with the support of the progressive part of the Hanoverian art scene , including artists such as Max Slevogt, Paula Modersohn-Becker or Emil Nolde. Küppers himself wrote numerous catalog texts and articles in magazines. His Die Tafelbilder des Domenico Ghirlandajo was published in 1916. After he wrote the book Der Kubismus Ein künstlerisches Formproblem unserer Zeit, which was published in 1919 under the direction of Küppers. Küppers founded the Kestner stage with Karl Aloys Schenzinger. In 1922, Küppers died in Hanover and his widow Sophie, met and fell in love with the Russian Constructivist artist El Lissitzky, whom she followed to the Soviet Union in 1926 and married a year later.

Written for a virtuoso first violin, with accompanying string trio (violin, viola, cello), like many similar works of this period, was based on themes from popular operas, in this case Mozart's Die Entführung aus dem Serail (In Mohrenland gefangen war) and Don Giovanni (Batti, batti). The composition is made up of a single multi-tempo movement, marked Adagio con molto espressione – Andante – Grazioso – Allegro vivace – Allegretto, and an average performance should take around 11 minutes.

"The Colonial Prison Service Medal was established on 28 October 1955 as a long service medal of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. On 10 April 2012 the medal became known as the Overseas Territories Prison Service Medal, and underwent a minor change in design. This reflected the change in the way Britain's remaining colonies were described, they having been classed as 'Overseas Territories' from 2002. The medal may be awarded for long service and good conduct to prison service staff of all ranks, who on or after 28 October 1955, have completed eighteen years of continuous qualifying service. Previous qualifying service in the Prison Service of other colonies or territories may be counted towards the required period. Service with the police may be counted if it is continuous with service with the prison services. Clasps are granted to recipients of the medal who complete twenty-five years qualifying service, and a subsequent clasp on completing thirty-five years of qualifying service. In undress, when only ribbons are worn, these clasps are represented by silver rosettes attached to the ribbon. A recipient who is convicted of a criminal offence or dismissed for misconduct would forfeit the medal. The medal is circular, silver, and 36mm (1.4in) in diameter. The obverse bears the crowned effigy of Elizabeth II surrounded by the royal titles. The reverse depicts a phoenix rising out of flames and flying upwards toward the sun.

"The University of Siegen (German: Universität Siegen) is a public research university located in Siegen, North Rhine-Westphalia and is part of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, a society of Germany's leading research universities. The University was founded in 1972. 18,618 students were enrolled at the university as of the year 2017. Siegen's heritage as a centre for education and research dates back to the 16th century. In 1536, William I, Count of Nassau-Siegen charged Saxon educator and theologian Erasmus Sarcerius with the task of establishing a Latin school. During the period 1594 to 15991600 and 1606 to 1609, the Calvinist-Reformed Herborn Academy (Academia Nassauensis) moved from Herborn to Siegen, where it was accommodated in the buildings of the lower castle. In 1853, Wiesenbauschule landscaping school was established, which soon gained a reputation outside of its local area. Here, landscaping and land improvements including irrigation techniques and the drainage of meadows were taught, so as to help enhance the yields from farmland. This was of particular importance in the Siegerland region because the high demand for charcoal for the regional ironworks meant that most areas were woodland. As a result, limited areas were suitable for cattle breeding, so that research into enhancing the yields from the limited amount of meadowland had to be researched. Following World War Two, the school's focus shifted towards civil engineering, and, in 1962, it was renamed Staatliche Ingenieurschule für Bauwesen (State School of Civil Engineering). The next academic facility to be set up in Siegen (formerly located at WeidenauHüttental) was the Pädagogische Hochschule Siegerland (Educational University Siegerland), established in 1964. In 1965, it became the Siegerland section of Pädagogische Hochschule Westfalen-Lippe (Educational University Westfalen-Lippe), which marked its transformation into a scientific university. On 1 August 1972, the comprehensive university development act led to the setting up of a comprehensive university at SiegenHüttental, along with four other comprehensive universities in North Rhine-Westphalia. The Pädagogische Hochschule Siegerland and Siegen-Gummersbach University of Applied Sciences which had schools based at Siegen and Gummersbach merged to form the new Siegen comprehensive university. In 1980, Siegen comprehensive university was renamed Universität-Gesamthochschule (University-Comprehensive University). The Gummersbach location was transferred, on 1 June 1983, to Cologne University of Applied Sciences. Then, on 1 January 2003, the form of ""comprehensive university"" was abandoned, and the existing comprehensive universities became regular universities. Since then, the university has been called University of Siegen. In 1996, the UniversityComprehensive University of Siegen was the first German university to take part in the ""Institutional Quality Audit Programme"" of the Conference of European Rectors (CRE) and went on to implement the auditors' recommendations step-by-step. University of Siegen sees itself as a modern university with a focus on basic research, practical training and contributing towards structural change in the district of Siegen-Wittgenstein and adjacent regions. In line with the political objectives which led to the establishment of comprehensive universities, the University of Siegen is a hallmark for democracy, equal opportunities, transparent professional and scientific education as well as an international outlook. The reform approach inherent to the comprehensive university was put into practice through integral programmes, such as the innovative integrated diploma programmes ""Media planning, development and consultancy"" and ""German and European commercial law"". Within the framework of the Bologna process, the University of Siegen implemented the BachelorMasters system early on, with the aim of completing the set-up of this model in all faculties during winter semester 2006–2007. The last remaining diploma programmes were actually transformed into BachelorMasters programmes during winter semester 2008–2009. This move enables students' achievements to be comparable and drives the international orientation of programmes. In addition, modern language training with a focus on partnerships abroad is being introduced and enhanced. The University of Siegen is increasingly committed to working with alumni and organizes alumni meetings at regular intervals. University of Siegen offers in total 126 degree programmes across four faculties: The university has a combined undergraduate and graduate student population of around 17,500. Approximately 13.5% of these students are foreigners. The University of Siegen offers a large variety of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral degree programs at its four faculties in 144 fields of study. As common among German universities, the academic year consists of summer and winter terms (semesters). The winter term runs from 1 October to 31 March, while the summer term runs from 1 April to 30 September. However, lectures and classes usually do not run for the full duration of these periods and allow for breaks in spring and fall. German universities enjoy government subsidies, and as a result of legislative reform, beginning in Fall 2011 the University of Siegen will no longer charge tuition fees. There are numerous student clubs and organizations, among them a student-run radio station, Radius 92.1, and a student television program, Campus TV. Siegen is situated in one of the most densely forested areas in Germany and offers fine opportunities for leisure and outdoor activities. The university provides student housing in its various dormitories, run by the Studentenwerk. Additionally, there are further dormitories in Siegen which are operated by other institutions as well as partnerships with elderly people. Many students find private living arrangements, such as Wohngemeinschaften (shared apartments). The International Office is the main contact for questions concerning the international course of studies, the international academy cooperation and the international academic exchange. Additionally the International Office guides and mentors international applicants for a place at university with all kinds of questions around the course of studies and life in Siegen. A number of activities for international students facilitates their integration and help students to find new friends. Each semester the International Office offers a Welcome week where international students are guided through their first steps in Siegen (walk through the city, opening a bank account, registration for medical insurance etc.). During the semester a program including trips to nearby cities, intercultural trainings or high rope courses is offered. The University of Siegen is a campus university with some 92,000 m² of floor space. Buildings are distributed across three core areas in Siegen (Haardter Berg hill, Emmy-Noether-Campus and administration based at Herrengarten). Most university buildings are on the north-eastern side of Siegen, in the Weidenau district. Facilities at Haardter Berg include the Adolf-Reichwein-Straße campus, which has the largest lecture halls, the central canteen, the central library as well as a part of the centre for information and media technology. Some 500 m south-east is the Hölderlinstraße campus, which accommodates the centre for information and media technology, the central course guidance service and a departmental library. Another 400 m south, at Paul-Bonatz-Straße, is the engineering Campus, the modern-day descendant of the former engineering school. Artur-Woll-Haus on the eastern slope of Haardter Berg hill, which opened on 25 March 2003, accommodates the guest house and the externally funded research facilities. Some 5 kilometres (3.1mi) south-west of Haardter Berg, at Fischbacherberg hill is the Emmy-Noether-Campus, which, since 1999, has been home to the mathematics and physics faculties. 1 kilometre (0.62mi) west of Haardter Berg, on the borders of the Weidenau and Geisweid districts, is the former brewery, where the art faculty is located. Here, art students create practical work, including painting and photography, and exhibitions are held on a regular basis. The university administration and student services are located in the former Siegen inland revenue offices at Herrengarten, right in the city centre, whilst the international office can be found in Siegen's former telegraph office. The city, the university and the government are working together to put Siegen's lower castle completely at the university's disposal to accommodate facilities and faculties. Artur-Woll-Haus is an exceptional building, which was designed by Dutch architects rau architecten. It consists of an arc-shaped central unit with three wings that resemble a tug. The cost of construction was around €8.6 million. The University of Siegen was planned together with other universities in North Rhine-Westphalia, so that a similar style and even some of the same building modules can be found at universities of Duisburg-Essen, Paderborn und Wuppertal. In the Times Higher Education World University Rankings of 2024, the university is placed at 601-800 globally and 46-48 within the country.",Normal

"The Isaurian War was a conflict that lasted from 492 to 497 and that was fought between the army of the Eastern Roman Empire and the rebels of Isauria. At the end of the war, Eastern Emperor Anastasius I regained control of the Isauria region and the leaders of the revolt were killed. During the reign of Theodosius II (r. 402–450) people from Isauria, a poor and mountainous province in Asia Minor, reached for the first time high office in the Eastern Roman Empire. Emperor Leo I (r. 457–474) deliberately promoted Isaurians to important posts in the civil and military administration to counterbalance the power of the hitherto all-powerful Germanic elements. The Isaurians, however, were despised as semi-barbarians by the people of Constantinople, who in 473 rose in an anti-Isaurian revolt in the Hippodrome and in 475 overthrew the newly crowned Isaurian emperor Zeno (r. 474–475 and 476–491), killing all the Isaurians in the city in the process. Zeno returned to the throne in 476, however, this time until his death in 491. Under this emperor, his fellow Isaurians prospered, and the opposition to them, although growing, remained latent. In 484, the Isaurian magister militum Illus rebelled against Zeno and fled to the East, where he supported the usurpation of Leontius. That, however, ended in 488 with the capture and execution of both rebel leaders. In 491 Emperor Zeno died and was succeeded by the silentiarius Anastasius I, chosen by Empress Ariadne. During the brief interregnum, the Constantinopolitan populace had made its views on the succession clear by cries in the Hippodrome demanding a ""Roman emperor"", thus rejecting the possible succession of Longinus, Zeno's brother. In the same year, anti-Isaurian riots broke out in the Hippodrome, and Anastasius exiled Longinus and several other Isaurians, including general Longinus of Cardala. In 492 the Isaurians began a revolt, but in the same year their joint forces were defeated by the Roman army, led by generals John the Scythian and John Gibbo (John the Hunchback), at Kotyaion in Phrygia (battle of Cotyaeum). Lilingis, a leading figure in the revolt, died after the battle. The Isaurian survivors took refuge in the mountain strongholds of their country and kept waging war. In 493 the Roman general Diogenianus captured Claudiopolis but was besieged there by the Isaurians, led by the ex-bishop Conon. To his help came John Gibbo who forced the passes and, helped by a sortie of Diogenianus', won an overwhelming victory against the Isaurians, in which Conon died. From 494 to 497 the Isaurians closed themselves in their fortresses in the Isaurian mountains, where they were kept supplied by Longinus of Selinus through the port of Antioch. In 497 John the Scythian killed Longinus of Cardala and Athenodorus, whose heads were exposed on a spear in Tarsus, thus effectively ending the war. In 498, John Gibbo captured the last enemy leaders, Longinus of Selinus and Indes, and sent them to the Emperor, who paraded them along the main road of Constantinople to the Hippodrome, where they had to perform the proskynesis in front of the imperial kathisma. In 495, Emperor Anastasius I told Patriarch Euphemius that he was tired of war. Euphemius reported this to John, the son-in-law of the Isaurian leader Athenodorus, who referred it back to Anastasius. The emperor had come into conflict with Euphemius before ascending to the throne; furthermore, Anastasius, who had Monophysite sympathies, had been forced by Euphemius to sign a declaration of orthodoxy before being crowned. For these reasons he decided to accuse Euphemius of treason for revealing plans to the enemy. In 496, Euphemius was excommunicated and deposed. After the war Anastasius rewarded his generals with the consulship: John the Scythian held the post in 498 and John Gibbo in 499. Anastasius also ordered the architect Aetherius to build the Chalke Gate to the Great Palace of Constantinople to celebrate the victory, and the poet Christodorus commemorated the war in a now-lost poem in six books, entitled Isaurica.",Normal

"Collecting Sunlight is the first EP from Swedish artist Andreas Moe. It was self-released in the UK on June 25, 2012, and received a wider release from Sony Music Sweden on the same date. The EP was highly anticipated worldwide, receiving rave reviews from music bloggers. Collecting Sunlight - EP came when following break up's with each of their long term girlfriends, Andreas Moe and best friend Micael Paavilainen (videographer and creator of most of Moe's videos to date) moved together to the small Swedish town of Saltsjobaden in Winter 2011. Moe recalls it as a time of 'darkness, heartbreak and hibernation'—and reveals that it was only then that he found himself ready to channel his personal experiences into his music. Having tried for years previous—it was only through heartbreak and solitude that Moe truly felt that he was beginning to develop 'his sound'. He admits that it was a painful process, and states that to explore his experiences while they were still so raw meant involving three writers and friends that he held close to his heart—Hiten Bharadia, Niclas Lundin and Maria Marcus. The foursome spent just two weeks writing and producing intensively—the result of which were the bare bones of The Collecting Sunlight EP. Moe describes the final product as 'a true souvenir of his journey back to self'—and the sound as a fusion of electronic and organic sounds. The record was released on June 25, 2012. So far, the Collecting Sunlight EP has been received well worldwide, with several popular online blogs posting reviews and articles about the forthcoming release. Most notable perhaps, is famous US blogger Arjan Writes, who wrote '""Moe simply makes enchanting, emotionally honest pop music that is positioned right on the intersection of happiness and heartbreak."" Other fans of Moe's include So So Gay, who posted a glowing introduction article teamed with a free download of song 'Volcanoes' in May 2012, as well as other popular music sites such as SBTV, LinkUpTV, Dropout UK, Music Is My Kingsize Bed, Rukkle and I Am Music TV.

"The fourth HMS Volunteer (D71), later I71, was a Modified W-class destroyer of the British Royal Navy that saw service in World War II. Volunteer was ordered in January 1918 as part of the 13th Order of the 1918-1919 Naval Programme. She was laid down on 16 April 1918 by William Denny and Brothers at Dumbarton, Scotland, and launched on 17 April 1919. She was completed on 7 November 1919 and commissioned into service the same day with the pennant number D71. Volunteer entered service with the fleet in 1919. During 1921 she was assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla in the Atlantic Fleet, and in 1925 she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet along with the rest of the flotilla. During the early 1930s, she was decommissioned, transferred to the Reserve Fleet, and placed in the Nore Reserve. She later was moved to Rosyth, Scotland, remaining in reserve there. In August 1939, Volunteer was recommissioned with a reserve crew for the Royal Review of the Reserve Fleet in Weymouth Bay by King George VI. She then remained in commission as the fleet mobilised because of deteriorating diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Nazi Germany The United Kingdom entered World War II on 3 September 1939, and Volunteer was assigned to the 15th Destroyer Flotilla. On 5 September, she joined the destroyers Vimy, Witherington, and Wolverine as the escort for Convoy GC 1 from Milford Haven, Wales. In October 1939 she was transferred to the 17th Destroyer Flotilla in Western Approaches Command for convoy defence operations in the Western Approaches and North Atlantic Ocean, based at Plymouth, and she continued these duties into 1940. On 8 January 1940, Volunteer joined the destroyers Vanoc, Venetia, and Viscount in escorting Convoy HG 13 during the final leg of its voyage from Gibraltar to Liverpool, detaching from the convoy in the Irish Sea on 10 January 1940 to return to Plymouth. On 5 March 1940, Volunteer, the destroyer Whirlwind, and the sloops Enchantress and Sandwich joined Convoy OG 21F as it formed for its voyage to Gibraltar; Volunteer stayed with the convoy until 8 March, then during her return voyage to Plymouth joined Venetia, Whirlwind, the destroyers Veteran and Wild Swan, and the sloop Leith in an unsuccessful search in the Southwestern Approaches for a German submarine reported by an Allied aircraft. From 25 to 26 March, Volunteer, the destroyer leader Campbell, the destroyers Walker and Wanderer, and the sloop Aberdeen escorted Convoy OG 23 in the Southwestern Approaches during the first leg of its voyage from the United Kingdom to Gibraltar. From 27 to 30 March, Volunteer and the sloops Scarborough and Wellington escorted Convoy HG 23 during the final portion of its voyage from Gibraltar to Liverpool. In April 1940, Volunteer was detached to serve under Rear Admiral (Destroyers) in the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands and support the operations of Allied forces in the Norwegian Campaign, which began on 9 April when Germany invaded Norway. She was assigned to escort convoys between the United Kingdom and Norway. The first of these was Convoy NP 1, the first troop convoy to Norway, in which she joined Vanoc, Whirlwind, Witherington, the light cruisers Birmingham and Manchester, the destroyer Highlander, and the netlayer Protector in escorting between 11 and 15 April as it crossed from the River Clyde in Scotland to Norway. She escorted similar convoys until 26 April, when she joined the destroyers Beagle, Encounter, Escort, Fortune, and Grenade as the escort for the aircraft carriers Ark Royal and Glorious during air operations in defence of fleet units at Andalsnes and Namsos, Norway. While thus engaged, she made an unsuccessful attack on a German submarine on 27 April before escorting Glorious to Scapa Flow for refuelling and aircraft replenishment. In May 1940 – the month in which her pennant number was changed to I71 – Volunteer continued to deploy off Norway. On 27 May, she, the destroyer Amazon, and the sloop Fleetwood escorted the damaged destroyer Eskimo, under tow from Skjelfjord, Norway, to the United Kingdom for repairs. With the German conquest of Norway bringing the Norwegian Campaign to a close, Volunteer returned to Western Approaches Command in June 1940 for convoy defence and patrol duties in the Western Approaches and North Atlantic. On 7 June 1940, Volunteer, the destroyer Wren, and the minesweeper Gleaner rescued survivors of the armed merchant cruiser Carinthia, which had sunk that day west of Galway Bay, Ireland, 36 hours after being torpedoed on 6 June at 53°13′00″N 010°40′00″W﻿ ﻿53.21667°N 10.66667°W﻿ 53.21667; -10.66667﻿ (""HMS Carinthia torpedoed"") by the German submarine U-46. The same day, Volunteer rescued the master of the British merchant ship SS Frances Massey, who was the sole survivor after the ship sank in only 30 seconds with the loss of 34 lives following a torpedo hit by the German submarine U-48 14 nautical miles (22.5km) northwest of Tory Island, Ireland, at 55°33′00″N 008°26′00″W﻿ ﻿55.55000°N 8.43333°W﻿ 55.55000; -8.43333﻿ (""SS Frances Massey sunk""). On 8 June, Volunteer escorted the heavy cruiser Devonshire, which had the Norwegian royal family embarked, to the Clyde. In July 1940, Volunteer escorted a convoy bound for Casablanca, French Morocco, for part of its voyage, detaching at Gibraltar to take up duties as a local escort for convoys. In August 1940, she provided local escort services for convoys bound for Operation Menace, the unsuccessful British attempt to occupy Dakar in Senegal, as well as for transatlantic convoys bound for the United Kingdom and two convoys in the English Channel. After the German submarine U-32 torpedoed the light cruiser Fiji on 1 September while underway to join the Dakar occupation force, Volunteer was among the destroyers that escorted her to the River Clyde in Scotland for repairs. In September 1940, Volunteer was transferred to convoy defence and anti-invasion patrol duties in the English Channel. She participated in night sweeps along the French coast, and in October 1940 took part in Operation Medium as one of two destroyers covering a naval force which bombarded Cherbourg, France. In November or December 1940 (sources differ), she returned to Western Approaches Command and resumed convoy escort operations in the Western Approaches and North Atlantic. In January 1941, Volunteer was reassigned to the 5th Escort Group, based at Londonderry (also called Derry), Northern Ireland, in which she joined Vanoc, Walker, the destroyer Caldwell, and nine Flower-class corvettes. She continued convoy defence operations in the North Atlantic with the group, which was under the command of Commander Donald Macintyre. In March 1941, Volunteer, Vanoc, Walker (serving as Macintyre's flagship), the destroyers Sardonyx and Scimitar, and the corvettes Bluebell and Hydrangea were escorting Convoy HX 112 when the German submarine U-110 sighted it. After Vanoc detected U-110 with radar, the escorts forced the submarine to submerge and depth-charged her. HX 112 then came under attack on 16–17 March by five German submarines, and its escorts were heavily engaged in its defence, during which Vanoc and Walker sank U-99, capturing her commanding officer, Otto Kretschmer, and Vanoc sank U-100, killing her commanding officer, Joachim Schepke. In April 1941, Volunteer was deployed at Devonport. On 10 or 17-18 April (sources differ) she was taking part in a local exercise when the destroyer Newark accidentally rammed her off the coast of Ireland. Volunteer suffered six men killed and serious damage to her forward structure. Later in the month, she proceeded to Belfast, Northern Ireland, for repairs at a commercial shipyard until September 1941. Volunteer returned to action with the 5th Escort Group in October 1941, and with the group formed part of the escort of Convoy HX 155. On 9 December 1941, she put to sea from Milford Haven as part of the escort of the battleship Ramillies, which was sailing to join the Eastern Fleet, escorting a troop convoy along the way. Ramillies, Volunteer, and the ships accompanying them escorted the convoy, WS 14, from 13 to 15 December 1941, when Volunteer and the destroyer Witch detached to return to the Clyde after the convoy arrived at Gibraltar. In December 1941, Volunteer was ""adopted"" by the city of Hereford in a Warship Week national savings campaign. On 12 January 1942, Volunteer put to sea from the Clyde with Vanoc, Walker, Witherington, and the destroyer Vanquisher as the local escort of the military convoy WS 15 during its passage of the Northwestern Approaches, detaching on 15 January to return to the Clyde. Similarly, she departed the Clyde on 23 March 1942 with the destroyers Antelope, Beverley, Boadicea, Keppel, Leamington, Newport, and Rockingham and the escort destroyer Badsworth as the local escort for the military convoy WS 17 while it transited the Northwestern Approaches during the first leg of its voyage to the Middle East. After Keppel achieved a radio direction-finding fix on the German submarine U-587 on 26 March 1942, the escorts sighted the submarine on the surface and expended all of their depth charges in attacking her after she submerged. Volunteer shared credit with Leamington and the escort destroyers Aldenham and Grove for sinking U-587 in the North Atlantic west of Ushant at 47°21′00″N 021°39′00″W﻿ ﻿47.35000°N 21.65000°W﻿ 47.35000; -21.65000﻿ (""U-587 sunk"") with the loss of her entire crew of 42. Volunteer detached from the convoy later that day to return to the Clyde. From 18 to 20 April 1942, Volunteer, Badsworth, Boadicea, the destroyers Georgetown, Lancaster, St. Marys, and Salisbury, and the escort destroyer Lauderdale escorted the military convoy WS 18 during the first leg of its voyage in the Northwestern Approaches after departing the Clyde, detaching with Boadicea to return to the Clyde. Volunteer put to sea from the Clyde on 10 May 1942 along with Keppel, Leamington, St. Marys, and the destroyer Castleton to escort the military convoy WS 19 during the first leg of its voyage in the Northwestern Approaches; she detached to return to the Clyde on 13 May. After her return, Volunteer was assigned to the support of Arctic convoys steaming between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. Accordingly, she and the destroyers Achates, Ashanti, and Martin, the antiaircraft ship Alynbank, the corvettes Honeysuckle, Hyderabad, and Starwort, the Polish Navy destroyer ORPGarland, and the Free French Naval Forces corvette Roselys joined the escort of Convoy PQ 16 on 23 March for its voyage to the Soviet Union. German aircraft continuously shadowed the convoy, and German bombers, torpedo planes, and submarines carried out heavy attacks against it. On 25 March, Volunteer rescued the pilot of a Hawker Hurricane fighter from a Catapult Aircraft Merchantman (CAM ship) after the American merchant ship Carlton mistakenly had shot him down. Before German attacks ceased, PQ-16 had suffered the loss of seven of its 34 merchant ships and damage to four others and to Garland. On 30 March, the escorting ships handed the convoy over to the Eastern Local Escort and proceeded to port in North Russia, where Volunteer remained until she and the same ships that had protected PQ 16 escorted Convoy QP 13 from the Kola Inlet to the United Kingdom in a voyage which began on 26 June 1942. After an uneventful passage, Volunteer detached from the convoy at sea near Bear Island on 5 or 6 July 1942 (sources differ) to proceed to the United Kingdom. Upon her return, Volunteer entered a dockyard at Rosyth, Scotland, in July 1942 for a refit and to undergo conversion into a Long-Range Escort. She was in dockyard hands for the rest of 1942. With her conversion complete, Volunteer underwent post-conversion acceptance trials in January 1943 and proceeded to Tobermory on the Isle of Mull for workups. After she completed these in February 1943, she was assigned to the 4th Escort Group – in which she joined Beverley, Highlander, the destroyer Winchelsea, and six Flower-class corvettes – based at Greenock, Scotland. In March 1943, Volunteer was the flagship of Commander G. J. Luther, commanding the escort – which also included Beverley and the corvettes Anemone and Pennywort – of Convoy HX 229, consisting of 40 merchant ships. HX 229 and Convoy SC 122 came under attack by German submarines of the Raubgraf (""Robber Baron"") and Dranger (""Harrier"") wolfpacks on 16 March, and the action developed into the largest convoy battle of World War II, with 38 German submarines of three wolfpacks involved. During heavy German attacks on 17 March, the submarine U-616 made an unsuccessful torpedo attack on Volunteer. By the time the escorts, outnumbered two-to-one by attacking submarines, received reinforcements on 18 March and the German attacks abated, HX 229 had lost 13 merchant ships sunk, and its escorts, although constantly attacking submarine contacts, had been unable to sink any of the attacking submarines. In May 1943, Volunteer joined the 5th Escort Group in escorting Convoy ONS 7. The convoy underwent a series of attacks by German submarines of the Donau 1 (""Danube"" 1) group from 11 to 13 May, and attacks resumed on 17 May. However, the convoy took evasive action and lost only one merchant ship. Volunteer continued her North Atlantic convoy defence operations from June to September 1943, but also began escorting convoys between the United Kingdom and Gibraltar carrying troops, equipment, and supplies for Allied offensive operations in Sicily and Italy. From June to September, she also took part in offensive antisubmarine operations by Allied ships and aircraft in the Bay of Biscay targeting German submarines transiting the bay between their bases in German-occupied France and their operating areas in the Atlantic. In October 1943, she participated in Operation Alacrity, the establishment of Allied air and refueling bases in the Azores, by deploying with the 4th and 5th Escort Groups as an escort for convoys carrying personnel, equipment, and supplies to the Azores. In November she returned to the antisubmarine offensive in the Bay of Biscay, and she resumed convoy defence operations in the North Atlantic in December 1943. Volunteer continued on North Atlantic convoy escort duty until April 1944, when she was reassigned to operations in the English Channel escorting convoys along the coast of Great Britain. Later in the month she was assigned to convoy escort operations in Operation Neptune in support of the Allied invasion of Normandy, scheduled for early June 1944. On 21 April 1944, she and the escort destroyer Haldon and Free French Naval Forces escort destroyer La Combattante were in action against German motor torpedo boats – S-boats, known to the Allies as ""E-boats"" – of the 9th Flotilla off Hastings. In early June 1944, Volunteer joined the trawlers Ellesmere, Kingston Andalusite, and Ruby and the Royal Canadian Navy corvette HMCSSummerside at Milford Haven to form Escort Group 144 of Force B for the Normandy landings. On 4 June, the group escorted Convoy EBC2 – consisting of 32 motor transport carriers and coasters and five oil tankers – from Milford Haven through the Bristol Channel to the Solent; after the landings were postponed from 5 to 6 June due to bad weather, the convoy's arrival in the Solent was delayed to 6 June. On 7 June, the second day of the invasion, the convoy and its escorts got underway from the Solent and proceeded to the American beachhead in Normandy, off which they arrived on 8 June. Later that day, Volunteer detached from the convoy to return to Milford Haven and begin escorting convoys bringing reinforcements and supplies to the beaches, the first of which she escorted through the Bristol Channel on 10 June. She continued to escort convoys to Normandy until later in June, when she was released from Operation Neptune. In July 1944, Volunteer came under the Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth and returned to the escort of coastal convoys in the English Channel. In August 1944, she was one of the escorts of three tank landing ships which discharged supplies for the United States Army's 12th Army Group at Saint-Michel-en-Grève, France. In November 1944 she became part of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla (Portsmouth), and in December 1944 she became part of the 21st Destroyer Flotilla under the Commander-in-Chief, The Nore at Sheerness. By January 1945, she was escorting convoys in the Nore, the North Sea, and the English Channel. She continued in these duties without major incident through the surrender of Germany in early May 1945 and until the end of May 1945. Withdrawn from operational service at the end of May 1945, Volunteer was decommissioned and placed in reserve in June 1945, and by July 1945, she no longer appeared on the Royal Navy's active list. Placed on the disposal list in 1947, she was sold to BISCO on 3 or 4 March 1947 (sources differ) for scrapping by either M. Brechin or by Granton Shipbreaking (sources differ). She was towed to the shipbreaker's yard at Granton, Edinburgh, Scotland, in December 1947 or April 1948 (sources differ) and scrapped there in April 1948.",Normal
"The soundtrack for the 2022 American superhero film Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, the sequel to Black Panther (2018) based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, is produced by Marvel Studios and consists of an original score composed and produced by Ludwig Göransson. He has worked as the composer for Ryan Coogler's previous films. Göransson, who confirmed his involvement in the film in September 2021, also produced and curated most of the original songs for the album. Since the storyline is primarily set in the underwater civilization of Talokan, and is rooted in Mesoamerican, Wakandan, and Nigerian cultures, Göransson went to Mexico City to research and recreate the Mayan music, feeling that the music is forcibly erased from history. Various ancient instruments from these cultures were utilized for the score to recreate the Mayan music, which he felt he had ""never heard in a film before,"" while the orchestra and Mayan sounds were produced into the score. The theme for T'Challa, the titular protagonist in the first film, was altered and integrated into the score. Recording for the soundtrack and score happened simultaneously in Mexico and Lagos, with additional recording in Los Angeles. Göransson collaborated with contemporary artists — rappers, singers, indigenous musicians, and indigenous singers for recording the original songs in the album. A soundtrack extended play titled Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Prologue was released by Hollywood Records and Marvel Music on July 25, 2022, featuring three songs, including Tems' cover of Bob Marley's ""No Woman, No Cry"" which was featured in the teaser trailer. The soundtrack album was released as Black Panther: Wakanda Forever – Music from and Inspired By on November 4, by Roc Nation, Def Jam Recordings, and Hollywood Records, with Rihanna's original single ""Lift Me Up"" releasing a week before the album, on October 28. The soundtrack album received critical acclaim. Göransson's score album was released as Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (Original Score) by Hollywood Records on November 11, coinciding with the film's release. Wakanda Forever partially takes place in the underwater civilization of Talokan, the city where Namor resides. Tālocān is rooted in Mesoamerican culture, and Wakanda is rooted in African culture. Göransson worked with several musical archaeologists to extensively research and recreate the Mayan music, as he felt that ""the music was forcibly erased from the world, hundreds of years ago"" and also went to Mexico City, to possibly recreate the sound of Mayan. In the research, several instruments from the graves were found, including flutes with multiple components and fingerprints demonstrating how the instrument can be played. Göransson opined that, ""a lot of the instruments are from nature. So it's like seashells, there are turtle shells that you hit with sticks, there are different kinds of clay flutes that make the sounds of birds, and shakers that sound like snakes. It was so inspiring to hear all these sounds that I never heard before and definitely never heard in a movie before."" Namor's sound was a seashell, hence Göransson played his theme using the object since it was an integral part of the script. He felt that seashell is a difficult instrument to play, as ""the tone can sometimes be similar to a French horn, but you don't have the same range in tonality and intervals. Göransson explains, ""You're very limited in your notes and how you could access the notes fast because you're basically changing the notes by just putting your hand in the seashell. So it was kind of a combination of two different seashells because we had to experiment a little bit to get the exact melody that I wanted. And sometimes when you see Namor by himself, in a more intimate setting, it's just a solo seashell melody. But then, when you see him with all his people, ready to go to war, it's the seashell accompanied by eight French horns. So it gets an extra power to it."" Another instrument that portrays the sound of Namor, was the ""death whistle,"" a clay flute which sound like a ""crazy, otherworldly animal scream,"" which represents Namor's action or strength, resulting in the abrasive sound. Several vocal sounds were used for the citizens of Tālocāns, which were described it as ""low male, throat singing type vocals."" T'Challa's theme from the first film was altered in the sequel, as he felt that, ""the theme is the same, but immersed with another character."" A new theme was written for Shuri to underscore the process of grief and anger, as ""when you first hear the theme, it's sung by Jorja Smith and throughout the story, that theme evolves to evoke the kind of leader that Shuri wants to be. It even takes on a completely different shape in the form of a bombastic synthesizer."" Riri Williams Ironheart also had a unique theme, which Göransson had stated, ""she's from Chicago, so the culture of the city is part of her sound. I'm learning about this very progressive music city, including house and hip hop, so I'm just dipping my toe in her character."" Göransson produced most of the songs and served as the executive producer of the soundtrack in addition to composing the score, which he described as a ""seamless process."" While recording the score during the daytime, with the Mayan instruments and sounds, he also recorded songs with contemporary artists and used the elements which he would record for the score, in the songs. The music production began as Ryan Coogler was filming Wakanda Forever, discussing the script with the artists along the way by adding ""every note, every word, every lyric, everything was written specifically for the movie."" At the recording in Mexico, the song ""Laayli' kuxa'ano'one"", performed by Mayan rappers Pat Boy, Yaalen K’uj, and All Mayan Winik, was first recorded which was set during the end credits. Another session was held in Lagos, Nigeria where three songs were recorded: a cover version of ""No Woman, No Cry"", performed by Tems, ""Coming Back for You"" performed by Fireboy DML, and ""Anya mmiri"" performed by CKay featuring PinkPantheress. Göransson wrote the song, ""Árboles bajo el mar"", which was co-written by Vivir Quintana along with Mare Advertencia. It describes Namor's origin story, where his mother is forced to move into the ocean to escape the brutal assault of the Talokan, Göransson said, ""That song was so powerful that some of that vocal melody I used later on in the theme for the Talokan siren song that they use to hypnotize people. I kind of got hypnotized myself when she  started singing and pushing out air when she was breathing. It needed to be enticing and threatening, and we had that sung by a choir of Mexican singers."" Another track, ""Con la brisa"", was performed by Mexican singer Foudeqush, which was played when Namor took Shuri on a tour to Talokan. T'Challa's theme plays at the beginning of the song, with the lyrics of the song punctuated over the drum motif. On October 18, 2022, it was confirmed that singer Rihanna had recorded two original songs for the film's soundtrack: ""Lift Me Up"" and ""Born Again"". The former was officially announced on October 26, 2022, as her first solo single release since ""Love on the Brain"" (2016), and was released as a single, two days later. A music video to accompany the single was released on Rihanna's official YouTube channel on the same day. Göransson produced and co-wrote the track, with Rihanna, Coogler and Tems. He said that the song is a tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman, who played T'Challa, the titular protagonist in Black Panther; Boseman died of cancer in August 2020. According to Clash, ""Lift Me Up"" is an ""emotive"" R&B ballad that ""speaks from the heart."" The song was met with a mixed critical reception, but performed well commercially, reaching number one in Switzerland, number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, number three on UK Official Singles Chart, and featured in the top 10 in 10 other countries. It also topped the Billboard Hot R&BHip-Hop Songs and Hot R&B Songs charts. A soundtrack extended play titled, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Prologue (or simply Wakanda Forever Prologue), was released by Hollywood Records on July 25, 2022. It featured Tems' cover of Bob Marley's ""No Woman, No Cry"", which was used in the film's teaser trailer, along with two other songs: ""A Body, A Coffin"" by Amaarae, and ""Soy"" by Santa Fe Klan. Göransson produced all three songs and also served as one of the songwriters for ""A Body, A Coffin"". Black Panther: Wakanda Forever – Music from and Inspired By, a compilation soundtrack album for the film was announced in late-October and was released by Roc Nation, Def Jam Recordings and Hollywood Records on November 4, 2022. The album featured Rihanna's original single, ""Lift Me Up"" alongside several incorporated songs performed by an array of international artists from South Africa, Mexico and Nigeria, notably Burna Boy, Snow Tha Product, E-40, Stormzy, Fireboy DML, Tobe Nwigwe, Future, PinkPantheress and several others. Göransson, who executive produced the soundtrack, said in an interview, ""Ryan and I talked about the importance of creating an immersive journey of sound and voice. If we used a song in the film, we wanted it to be the entire song, and to be connected to the story. Thematically, we wanted to move the audience from grief to celebration. When you listen to the soundtrack, you can close your eyes and relive the experience of the movie. That was the intention."" On November 11, 2022, ""Born Again"", a song performed by Rihanna, was added as the album's final track through various streaming services. Göransson's score was released as Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (Original Score) by Hollywood Records and Marvel Music on November 11, 2022, the same day as the film's release. All music is composed by Ludwig Göransson In a four-star review, Rolling Stone writer Maura Johnston stated that the Wakanda Forever soundtrack ""breaks that trend with verve and gusto in a way befitting a movie about the world's most tech-savvy nation"" and also stated ""Rihanna is the biggest bold-face name but the entire project is musically rich and carefully curated"". Dylan Green of Pitchfork had scored the album 6.410 and praised the ""staggering sonic diversity"", but criticised the absence of a curator for the album, as he felt that ""the songs are loosely tied to the movie"". Nick Harley of Den of Geek reviewed the album positively, saying that the soundtrack ""builds off of its predecessor, showcasing household-name artists and Afro-futurist sounds"". Jon Pareles of The New York Times mentioned that the album ""draws on musicians and instruments from Africa and Mexico along with American and British rappers and singers"", adding that the film ""revolves around grief, loyalty, vengeance and territorial security, and its music — both the Inspired By album and a separate Original Score album by Goransson — is largely somber, even ominous"". Writing for Universal Music New Zealand, Chantal Dalebroux stated ""the musical choices reflect this and Wakanda Forever's general narrative progression"".",Normal
"In computing, virtual memory, or virtual storage, is a memory management technique that provides an ""idealized abstraction of the storage resources that are actually available on a given machine"" which ""creates the illusion to users of a very large (main) memory"". The computer's operating system, using a combination of hardware and software, maps memory addresses used by a program, called virtual addresses, into physical addresses in computer memory. Main storage, as seen by a process or task, appears as a contiguous address space or collection of contiguous segments. The operating system manages virtual address spaces and the assignment of real memory to virtual memory. Address translation hardware in the CPU, often referred to as a memory management unit (MMU), automatically translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Software within the operating system may extend these capabilities, utilizing, e.g., disk storage, to provide a virtual address space that can exceed the capacity of real memory and thus reference more memory than is physically present in the computer. The primary benefits of virtual memory include freeing applications from having to manage a shared memory space, ability to share memory used by libraries between processes, increased security due to memory isolation, and being able to conceptually use more memory than might be physically available, using the technique of paging or segmentation. Virtual memory makes application programming easier by hiding fragmentation of physical memory; by delegating to the kernel the burden of managing the memory hierarchy (eliminating the need for the program to handle overlays explicitly); and, when each process is run in its own dedicated address space, by obviating the need to relocate program code or to access memory with relative addressing. Memory virtualization can be considered a generalization of the concept of virtual memory. Virtual memory is an integral part of a modern computer architecture; implementations usually require hardware support, typically in the form of a memory management unit built into the CPU. While not necessary, emulators and virtual machines can employ hardware support to increase performance of their virtual memory implementations. Older operating systems, such as those for the mainframes of the 1960s, and those for personal computers of the early to mid-1980s (e.g., DOS), generally have no virtual memory functionality, though notable exceptions for mainframes of the 1960s include: During the 1960s and early '70s, computer memory was very expensive. The introduction of virtual memory provided an ability for software systems with large memory demands to run on computers with less real memory. The savings from this provided a strong incentive to switch to virtual memory for all systems. The additional capability of providing virtual address spaces added another level of security and reliability, thus making virtual memory even more attractive to the marketplace. Most modern operating systems that support virtual memory also run each process in its own dedicated address space. Each program thus appears to have sole access to the virtual memory. However, some older operating systems (such as OSVS1 and OSVS2 SVS) and even modern ones (such as IBM i) are single address space operating systems that run all processes in a single address space composed of virtualized memory. Embedded systems and other special-purpose computer systems that require very fast andor very consistent response times may opt not to use virtual memory due to decreased determinism; virtual memory systems trigger unpredictable traps that may produce unwanted and unpredictable delays in response to input, especially if the trap requires that data be read into main memory from secondary memory. The hardware to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses typically requires a significant chip area to implement, and not all chips used in embedded systems include that hardware, which is another reason some of those systems do not use virtual memory. In the 1950s, all larger programs had to contain logic for managing primary and secondary storage, such as overlaying. Virtual memory was therefore introduced not only to extend primary memory, but to make such an extension as easy as possible for programmers to use. To allow for multiprogramming and multitasking, many early systems divided memory between multiple programs without virtual memory, such as early models of the PDP-10 via registers. A claim that the concept of virtual memory was first developed by German physicist Fritz-Rudolf Güntsch at the Technische Universität Berlin in 1956 in his doctoral thesis, Logical Design of a Digital Computer with Multiple Asynchronous Rotating Drums and Automatic High Speed Memory Operation does not stand up to careful scrutiny. The computer proposed by Güntsch (but never built) had an address space of 105 words which mapped exactly onto the 105 words of the drums, i.e. the addresses were real addresses and there was no form of indirect mapping, a key feature of virtual memory. What Güntsch did invent was a form of cache memory, since his high-speed memory was intended to contain a copy of some blocks of code or data taken from the drums. Indeed, he wrote (as quoted in translation): ""The programmer need not respect the existence of the primary memory (he need not even know that it exists), for there is only one sort of addresses (sic) by which one can program as if there were only one storage."" This is exactly the situation in computers with cache memory, one of the earliest commercial examples of which was the IBM System360 Model 85. In the Model 85 all addresses were real addresses referring to the main core store. A semiconductor cache store, invisible to the user, held the contents of parts of the main store in use by the currently executing program. This is exactly analogous to Güntsch's system, designed as a means to improve performance, rather than to solve the problems involved in multi-programming. The first true virtual memory system was that implemented at the University of Manchester to create a one-level storage system as part of the Atlas Computer. It used a paging mechanism to map the virtual addresses available to the programmer onto the real memory that consisted of 16,384 words of primary core memory with an additional 98,304 words of secondary drum memory. The addition of virtual memory into the Atlas also eliminated a looming programming problem: planning and scheduling data transfers between main and secondary memory and recompiling programs for each change of size of main memory. The first Atlas was commissioned in 1962 but working prototypes of paging had been developed by 1959.: 2  In 1961, the Burroughs Corporation independently released the first commercial computer with virtual memory, the B5000, with segmentation rather than paging. IBM developed the concept of hypervisors in their CP-40 and CP-67, and in 1972 provided it for the S370 as Virtual Machine Facility370. IBM introduced the Start Interpretive Execution (SIE) instruction as part of 370-XA on the 3081, and VMXA versions of VM to exploit it. Before virtual memory could be implemented in mainstream operating systems, many problems had to be addressed. Dynamic address translation required expensive and difficult-to-build specialized hardware; initial implementations slowed down access to memory slightly. There were worries that new system-wide algorithms utilizing secondary storage would be less effective than previously used application-specific algorithms. By 1969, the debate over virtual memory for commercial computers was over; an IBM research team led by David Sayre showed that their virtual memory overlay system consistently worked better than the best manually controlled systems. Throughout the 1970s, the IBM 370 series running their virtual-storage based operating systems provided a means for business users to migrate multiple older systems into fewer, more powerful, mainframes that had improved priceperformance. The first minicomputer to introduce virtual memory was the Norwegian NORD-1; during the 1970s, other minicomputers implemented virtual memory, notably VAX models running VMS. Virtual memory was introduced to the x86 architecture with the protected mode of the Intel 80286 processor, but its segment swapping technique scaled poorly to larger segment sizes. The Intel 80386 introduced paging support underneath the existing segmentation layer, enabling the page fault exception to chain with other exceptions without double fault. However, loading segment descriptors was an expensive operation, causing operating system designers to rely strictly on paging rather than a combination of paging and segmentation. Nearly all current implementations of virtual memory divide a virtual address space into pages, blocks of contiguous virtual memory addresses. Pages on contemporary systems are usually at least 4 kilobytes in size; systems with large virtual address ranges or amounts of real memory generally use larger page sizes. Page tables are used to translate the virtual addresses seen by the application into physical addresses used by the hardware to process instructions; such hardware that handles this specific translation is often known as the memory management unit. Each entry in the page table holds a flag indicating whether the corresponding page is in real memory or not. If it is in real memory, the page table entry will contain the real memory address at which the page is stored. When a reference is made to a page by the hardware, if the page table entry for the page indicates that it is not currently in real memory, the hardware raises a page fault exception, invoking the paging supervisor component of the operating system. Systems can have, e.g., one page table for the whole system, separate page tables for each address space or process, separate page tables for each segment; similarly, systems can have, e.g., no segment table, one segment table for the whole system, separate segment tables for each address space or process, separate segment tables for each region in a tree of region tables for each address space or process. If there is only one page table, different applications running at the same time use different parts of a single range of virtual addresses. If there are multiple page or segment tables, there are multiple virtual address spaces and concurrent applications with separate page tables redirect to different real addresses. Some earlier systems with smaller real memory sizes, such as the SDS 940, used page registers instead of page tables in memory for address translation. This part of the operating system creates and manages page tables and lists of free page frames. In order to ensure that there will be enough free page frames to quickly resolve page faults, the system may periodically steal allocated page frames, using a page replacement algorithm, e.g., a Least recently used (LRU) algorithm. Stolen page frames that have been modified are written back to auxiliary storage before they are added to the free queue. On some systems the paging supervisor is also responsible for managing translation registers that are not automatically loaded from page tables. Typically, a page fault that cannot be resolved results in an abnormal termination of the application. However, some systems allow the application to have exception handlers for such errors. The paging supervisor may handle a page fault exception in several different ways, depending on the details: In most cases, there will be an update to the page table, possibly followed by purging the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), and the system restarts the instruction that causes the exception. If the free page frame queue is empty then the paging supervisor must free a page frame using the same page replacement algorithm for page stealing. Operating systems have memory areas that are pinned (never swapped to secondary storage). Other terms used are locked, fixed, or wired pages. For example, interrupt mechanisms rely on an array of pointers to their handlers, such as IO completion and page fault. If the pages containing these pointers or the code that they invoke were pageable, interrupt-handling would become far more complex and time-consuming, particularly in the case of page fault interruptions. Hence, some part of the page table structures is not pageable. Some pages may be pinned for short periods of time, others may be pinned for long periods of time, and still others may need to be permanently pinned. For example: In IBM's operating systems for System370 and successor systems, the term is ""fixed"", and such pages may be long-term fixed, or may be short-term fixed, or may be unfixed (i.e., pageable). System control structures are often long-term fixed (measured in wall-clock time, i.e., time measured in seconds, rather than time measured in fractions of one second) whereas IO buffers are usually short-term fixed (usually measured in significantly less than wall-clock time, possibly for tens of milliseconds). Indeed, the OS has a special facility for ""fast fixing"" these short-term fixed data buffers (fixing which is performed without resorting to a time-consuming Supervisor Call instruction). Multics used the term ""wired"". OpenVMS and Windows refer to pages temporarily made nonpageable (as for IO buffers) as ""locked"", and simply ""nonpageable"" for those that are never pageable. The Single UNIX Specification also uses the term ""locked"" in the specification for mlock(), as do the mlock() man pages on many Unix-like systems. In OSVS1 and similar OSes, some parts of systems memory are managed in ""virtual-real"" mode, called ""V=R"". In this mode every virtual address corresponds to the same real address. This mode is used for interrupt mechanisms, for the paging supervisor and page tables in older systems, and for application programs using non-standard IO management. For example, IBM's zOS has 3 modes (virtual-virtual, virtual-real and virtual-fixed). When paging and page stealing are used, a problem called ""thrashing"" can occur, in which the computer spends an unsuitably large amount of time transferring pages to and from a backing store, hence slowing down useful work. A task's working set is the minimum set of pages that should be in memory in order for it to make useful progress. Thrashing occurs when there is insufficient memory available to store the working sets of all active programs. Adding real memory is the simplest response, but improving application design, scheduling, and memory usage can help. Another solution is to reduce the number of active tasks on the system. This reduces demand on real memory by swapping out the entire working set of one or more processes. A system thrashing is often a result of a sudden spike in page demand from a small number of running programs. Swap-token is a lightweight and dynamic thrashing protection mechanism. The basic idea is to set a token in the system, which is randomly given to a process that has page faults when thrashing happens. The process that has the token is given a privilege to allocate more physical memory pages to build its working set, which is expected to quickly finish its execution and to release the memory pages to other processes. A time stamp is used to handover the token one by one. The first version of swap-token was implemented in Linux 2.6. The second version is called preempt swap-token and is also in Linux 2.6. In this updated swap-token implementation, a priority counter is set for each process to track the number of swap-out pages. The token is always given to the process with a high priority, which has a high number of swap-out pages. The length of the time stamp is not a constant but is determined by the priority: the higher the number of swap-out pages of a process, the longer the time stamp for it will be. Some systems, such as the Burroughs B5500, use segmentation instead of paging, dividing virtual address spaces into variable-length segments. A virtual address here consists of a segment number and an offset within the segment. The Intel 80286 supports a similar segmentation scheme as an option, but it is rarely used. Segmentation and paging can be used together by dividing each segment into pages; systems with this memory structure, such as Multics and IBM System38, are usually paging-predominant, segmentation providing memory protection. In the Intel 80386 and later IA-32 processors, the segments reside in a 32-bit linear, paged address space. Segments can be moved in and out of that space; pages there can ""page"" in and out of main memory, providing two levels of virtual memory; few if any operating systems do so, instead using only paging. Early non-hardware-assisted x86 virtualization solutions combined paging and segmentation because x86 paging offers only two protection domains whereas a VMM, guest OS or guest application stack needs three.: 22 The difference between paging and segmentation systems is not only about memory division; segmentation is visible to user processes, as part of memory model semantics. Hence, instead of memory that looks like a single large space, it is structured into multiple spaces. This difference has important consequences; a segment is not a page with variable length or a simple way to lengthen the address space. Segmentation that can provide a single-level memory model in which there is no differentiation between process memory and file system consists of only a list of segments (files) mapped into the process's potential address space. This is not the same as the mechanisms provided by calls such as mmap and Win32's MapViewOfFile, because inter-file pointers do not work when mapping files into semi-arbitrary places. In Multics, a file (or a segment from a multi-segment file) is mapped into a segment in the address space, so files are always mapped at a segment boundary. A file's linkage section can contain pointers for which an attempt to load the pointer into a register or make an indirect reference through it causes a trap. The unresolved pointer contains an indication of the name of the segment to which the pointer refers and an offset within the segment; the handler for the trap maps the segment into the address space, puts the segment number into the pointer, changes the tag field in the pointer so that it no longer causes a trap, and returns to the code where the trap occurred, re-executing the instruction that caused the trap. This eliminates the need for a linker completely and works when different processes map the same file into different places in their private address spaces. Some operating systems provide for swapping entire address spaces, in addition to whatever facilities they have for paging and segmentation. When this occurs, the OS writes those pages and segments currently in real memory to swap files. In a swap-in, the OS reads back the data from the swap files but does not automatically read back pages that had been paged out at the time of the swap out operation. IBM's MVS, from OSVS2 Release 2 through zOS, provides for marking an address space as unswappable; doing so does not pin any pages in the address space. This can be done for the duration of a job by entering the name of an eligible main program in the Program Properties Table with an unswappable flag. In addition, privileged code can temporarily make an address space unswappable using a SYSEVENT Supervisor Call instruction (SVC); certain changes in the address space properties require that the OS swap it out and then swap it back in, using SYSEVENT TRANSWAP. Swapping does not necessarily require memory management hardware, if, for example, multiple jobs are swapped in and out of the same area of storage.",Normal

"Bishad Shindhu (Bengali: বিষাদ-সিন্ধু, English: Ocean of Sorrow) is a Bengali epic novel by Mir Mosarraf Hussain, the first modern Bengali Shia writer and novelist. Regarded as a central work of Bengali literature, and Hussain's finest literary achievement, the novel chronicles the Shia version of the lives of Muhammad's grandsons, Hasan and Husayn, and the Battle of Karbala. Bishad Shindhu was originally published in three parts in 1885, 1887 and 1891 respectively. The novel was first published in its entirety in 1891. However, it is not considered an authentic source for the history of Karbala, the location of Husayn's war front, or the place of his death. It contains much poetic language, and many dramatic scenes. At the time of its composition, there were few published novels in the Bengali language, and Mosharraf Hussain was part of a community of writers working to pioneer a new tradition of novels in Bengali. The novel was written in Shadhubhasha, a highly Sanskritised form of Bengali. It was translated into English for the first time by Prof. Fakrul Alam in 2016, published by the Bangla Academy in Dhaka under the title ""Ocean of Sorrow"".",Normal

"Cucurbita argyrosperma, also called the cushaw squash and silver-seed gourd, is a species of winter squash originally from the south of Mexico. This annual herbaceous plant is cultivated in the Americas for its nutritional value: its flowers, shoots, and fruits are all harvested, but it is cultivated most of all for its seeds, which are used for sauces. It was formerly known as Cucurbita mixta. It is a Cucurbita species, with varieties that are commonly cultivated in the United States as part of the Eastern Agricultural Complex and Mexico south to Nicaragua. Of all the cultivated Cucurbita species it is the least found outside the Americas. It originated in Mesoamerica, most likely in the state of Jalisco, Mexico from its wild sororia form. The reference genome of this species was published in 2019. The flowers are orange or yellow and bloom in July or August. The plant grows about 1 foot high and spreads 10–15 feet. It likes well drained soil and has both male and female flowers. Fruits can weigh up to 20 pounds. The published results of an interspecific hybridization experiment in 1990 noted that as of that time Cucurbita argyrosperma was often grown in close proximity to Cucurbita moschata in Guatemala and Mexico. Cucurbita argyrosperma is classified into two subspecies: C. argyrosperma subsp. argyrosperma and C. argyrosperma subsp. sororia. C. argyrosperma subsp. sororia is believed to be the wild ancestor of the other forms. C. argyrosperma subsp. argyrosperma is further subdivided into C. argyrosperma subsp. argyrosperma var. argyrosperma , C. argyrosperma subsp. argyrosperma var. callicarpa, C. argyrosperma subsp. argyrosperma var. palmieri, and C. argyrosperma subsp. argyrosperma var. stenosperma. Cucurbita argyrosperma subsp. argyrosperma var. palmeri was formerly considered a separate species within Cucurbita. It is found from the Pacific coast of northwestern Mexico to Nicaragua. It was originally formally described by Liberty Hyde Bailey in 1943, in Gentes Herbarum. Cucurbita argyrosperma subsp. sororia was at one time considered a separate species within Cucurbita. It ranges from northern Mexico to Nicaragua, mostly along the Pacific coast. This species was also considered at one time to be closely related to Cucurbita texana with which it hybridizes well. It was formally described by Liberty Hyde Bailey in 1943, in Gentes Herbarum. In 1948, Cucurbita kellyana was described as an independent species, but this taxa is now considered a synonym for sororia. Variety is used here interchangeably with cultivar, but not with species or taxonomic variety. The flowers, stems, shoots, and unripe fruits of the plant are consumed as vegetables. In the south of Mexico, the wild, more bitter varieties are used in this same way, once washed and cleaned to eliminate cucurbitin. The ripe fruit is grilled to make pies or used to feed animals. The seeds yield an edible oil. It is also grown in the Sonoran Desert region of the Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico by native peoples, especially the Tohono O'odham, where it is especially prized when immature as a summer squash. Cucurbita argyrosperma also has medicinal properties. A liquid emulsion of its seed can act as a vermifuge, and the subsequent use of a laxative can effect an expulsion of parasitic worms. The Yucatán peasantry has traditionally used the flesh of Cucurbita argyrosperma to tend burns, sores, and eczema, while the seeds have been used with the aim of promoting lactation in nursing women, and provide pain relief.",Normal
"The 1985 Dallas Cowboys season was the franchise's 26th season in the National Football League. The Cowboys improved on their 9-7 record from 1984 and made the playoffs after a one-year absence. This marked the final postseason appearance for the Cowboys under Tom Landry and Bum Bright, where they were shutout in the divisional playoff game to the Los Angeles Rams. The team holds the record for consecutive winning seasons with 20. Tom Landry's team got off to a fast start, opening the season with 44-14 trouncing of their longtime nemesis, the Redskins, and later defeating the Steelers (their first victory over Pittsburgh since 1972) to give the team a 5–1 record and an early two-game lead over the rest of the division. However, the team was up and down the rest of the way, finishing out the season 5–5 and allowing both the Giants and Redskins to catch up with them at 10–6. Two wins each over both the Giants and Redskins allowed the Cowboys to win the division based on the tie-breaking rules. During the inconsistent stretch toward the end of the season, the Cowboys suffered two of the most embarrassing defeats in team history. On November 17, the undefeated Chicago Bears came to Texas Stadium and gave the Cowboys a 44–0 beating that was the worst loss in team history, and it was also the first time in 218 games that the Cowboys had not scored. Three weeks later the team traveled to Cincinnati, where the Bengals handed them a 50–24 loss, piling up 570 yards in the process, the most yards the Cowboys had given up in team history. The Cowboys proved to be a resilient bunch however, winning a crucial game at home against the Giants the following week that gave them their first division title since 1981, and the final for Tom Landry. That game would prove to be the last highlight of the season, as the team was shut out in the playoffs for the first time in team history, 20–0, by the Rams in Anaheim, California, which would prove to be the final playoff appearance for the Cowboys under Landry. With the previous season's quarterback controversy behind him, Danny White led the Cowboys' passing game to number three overall in the league. Wide receiver Tony Hill posted career highs in receptions and receiving yards, and Mike Renfro blossomed in his second season with the Cowboys. Tight end Doug Cosbie had another Pro Bowl season. Turnovers proved to be a problem though, as White and backup quarterback Gary Hogeboom combined to throw 24 interceptions. Running back Tony Dorsett was the only reliable ball carrier on the roster, rushing for 1,307 yards on the season, and going over 10,000 yards for his career. On the defensive side of the ball, the Cowboys registered 62 sacks and 33 interceptions, with cornerback Everson Walls becoming the first player to ever lead the league in interceptions three times, with nine. The big plays covered up a pass defense that ranked 27th in the league, and a defense that ranked 23rd overall. The secondary allowed big plays through the air throughout the season, and the defense allowed running back Eric Dickerson to rush for a playoff record 248 yards in their playoff game against the Rams.

"The Russian Women's Football Championship (Russian: Чемпионат России по футболу среди женщин), also known as the Top Division and the Women's Football League, is the highest professional  women's football league in Russia. The Top Division was founded in 1992. Prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, the women's league played two seasons in 1990 and 1991. For the 2010 season the seven teams play each other four times, two times away and two games at home. In previous years the team played each other only twice. As Russia is in the top 8 leagues of Europe by UEFA Coefficient the top two teams qualify for the UEFA Women's Champions League and the last team gets relegated to the Women’s 1.Division. The 2011–12 season was the first to last over the winter month. Eight teams contest the season and play each other four times for a total of 28 matches. The tie-breaking rules after the season are in descending order: points, number of wins, then in matches between tied teams: points, wins, goal difference, goals scored, away goals scored, after that in all matches: goal difference, goals scored, away goal scored, better fair-play record and finally the tie is broken by drawing of a lot. One exception is, if there is a tie of points involving the first place, thus the tie-breaking would determine the champion. In this case, there is an additional match, or in case of at least a three way tie a tournament to be played. In the 2012–13 season a championship and relegation round was played after the regular season. After 14 matches each, the top four and bottom four teams played each other twice more.

"SS Calgaric was a steam ocean liner that was completed in 1917, assumes service in 1918 and scrapped in 1934. She was built for the Pacific SN Co Line as Orca. In 1923 she was transferred to the Royal Mail Line. In 1927 she was transferred to White Star Line and renamed Calgaric. Orca was the third of three sister ships built for Pacific Steam. The first was Orduña, launched in 1913, and the second was Orbita, launched in 1914. Harland & Wolff built Orca at Belfast during the First World War. She was yard number 442, built on slipway number 7. She was launched on 5 April 1917 and delivered to Pacific Steam on 25 May 1918. Orca had the same dimensions and engines as Orduña and Orbita. Her registered length was 550.3ft (167.7m), her beam was 67.3ft (20.5m) and her depth was 43.0ft (13.1m). She also had the same propulsion system. She had three screws and a propulsion system called ""combination machinery"". Her port and starboard screws were each powered by a four-cylinder triple expansion engine. Exhaust steam from this pair of reciprocating engines drove a low-pressure turbine, which powered her middle screw. Between them the three engines developed a total of 11,900 ihp and gave Orca a speed of 15 knots (28kmh). Orca was planned as an ocean liner for Pacific Steam's passenger service between Britain and the west coast of South America. However, for war service the Shipping Controller had her completed as a cargo ship, without her passenger superstructure. Pacific Steam registered her in Liverpool. Her official number was 140579 and her code letters were JTLW. In 1921 Orca returned to Harland & Wolff for her passenger superstructure to be added. She was given berths for 890 passengers: 190 first class, 220 second class and 480 third class. Her public rooms included an entrance hall and First Class lounge decorated in Louis XVI style, a First Class dining room in early Georgian style, and a Smoking Room in Elizabethan style, complete with fireplace. To ascend or descend between decks, passengers had a choice of electric elevators, or a staircase lit by a domed skylight. By the time the refit had been completed at the end of 1922, the Royal Mail Steam Packet Co had full control of Pacific Steam, and Orca and her two sisters were transferred to the RMSP fleet. She finally started her passenger maiden voyage, on 3 January 1923, sailing from Southampton via Hamburg to New York. Thence until March 1923 she operated two ""off-season"" cruises the Caribbean before reverting to liner service. A few years later, RMSP used Orca for the company's first ""Great African Cruise"". In 1926 RMSP took over White Star Line, and Orca was one of several RMSP ships transferred to the White Star fleet. She was refitted again, second class was renamed ""tourist class"", and her accommodation was increased to a total of 1,170 passengers: 290 first class, 550 tourist class and 330 third class. White Star ran services to Canada, so Orca was renamed Calgaric after the city of Calgary in Alberta. On 4 May 1927 she started her first voyage for White Star, sailing from Liverpool to the east coast of Canada. She continued to do a lot of cruising as well as her liner work. In 1929 White Star transferred her from its Liverpool – Canada service to its London – Canada service. The Great Depression that started in 1929 caused a Global slump in shipping. Calgaric was laid up from 1930 until 1933. In June 1933 Calgaric returned to service for a single transatlantic crossing from Liverpool to Montreal. Thereafter she made a few cruises. The Scout Association chartered Calgaric to take scoutmasters and Guide mistresses on a Baltic cruise in August 1933. Passengers included the Baden-Powell family, about 100 Scoutmasters, 475 Guide mistresses, and 80 non-Scouts and Guides – presumably their spouses. There were 85 men and 570 women – some of the Wolf Cub Akelas were women. The cruise began from Southampton on Saturday 12 August and ended at Liverpool on 29 August. Her itinerary was Rotterdam, the Kiel Canal, Gdynia, Klaipėda, Riga, Tallinn, Helsinki, Stockholm, Oslo, the Pentland Firth and Oban. In 1934 Calgaric was assigned the new four-letter wireless telegraph call sign GLTR to replace her former code letters. On 10 May Cunard Line took over the ailing White Star to form Cunard-White Star Line. By then Calgaric had been laid up again. She was sold for scrap, and on Christmas Day 1934 she arrived at Rosyth in Scotland for Metal Industries, Limited to break her up.",Normal

"Wilfrid Loizeau (born 20 March 1985) is a footballer who currently plays with Swiss club FC Bavois. Born in metropolitan France, he represented Guadeloupe at international level. Loizeau plays primarily on the right and left wings for Guadeloupe, but also as a central attacking midfielder. After passing through the renowned youth academies of Le Havre and Auxerre, Loizeau spent the early years of his professional career with Créteil (then in Ligue 2) and Paris FC (then in Championnat National) before moving abroad in 2006, to Romanian Liga II side Petrolul Ploieşti. After a brief spell in Romania, in the summer of 2007 Loizeau signed with SIAD Most, then competing in the Gambrinus liga, the top league in the Czech Republic. Most loaned Loizeau for the season to their subsidiary club Chmel Blšany in the Bohemian Football League (ČFL). In 2007–08 Loizeau made 11 appearances (all starts) for Blšany. At the end of the season (and the loan period), Most was relegated to the Czech 2. Liga, so rather than return to Most, Loizeau decided to leave Czech Republic. Loizeau spent most of preseason 2008–09 with Vitória de Setúbal of the Portuguese Liga, the top league in Portugal. During the spell Loizeau played in friendly matches against several top clubs, including English Premier League side Sunderland. Loizeau performed well and very nearly signed with the Portuguese club, but supposedly his contract could not be ""approved for administrative reasons"" and was nothing at all due to the fact he could not even kick a ball in a straight line. After his time in Portugal, Loizeau arrived in Belgium for trials. After playing in a friendly match for Belgian Second Division club Royal Antwerp F.C. against Excelsior Virton, the opposing side Virton, also of the Belgian Second Division, quickly offered Loizeau a contract. Loizeau officially signed a one-year contract with Virton on 16 October 2008; the contract included a clause that would allow Loizeau to leave the club during the winter transfer window. In December 2008 Loizeau was called into the Guadeloupe National Team's squad for the final round of the 2008 Caribbean Championship in Jamaica. R.E. Virton officials were not happy with Loizeau's decision to accept his national team's invitation; as a result, when Loizeau returned to Belgium following the Caribbean Championship, he and the club decided to part ways. In 2009, Loizeau moved to the United States to play with Atlanta Blackhawks in the USL Premier Development League. Following his time in Atlanta, Wilfrid was offered a contract at MLS outfit San Jose Earthquakes but decided that it was not the right move for him at the time. On 11 February 2010, AC St. Louis of the USSF Division 2 Professional League announced it had signed Loizeau to play with the team in 2010 after he had failed to turn up to other trials he had organised in Europe.; however, Wilfrid's eventual move to St. Louis did not go through for unknown reasons, as he did not end up on AC St. Louis' final roster for the season. After the departure of Atlanta Silverbacks signed in summer 2009 for Swiss 1.Liga Gruppe 1 club FC Bavois. Loizeau made his Guadeloupe National Team debut at the Final Round of the 2006–07 Caribbean Nations Cup that was played in January 2007 in Trinidad and Tobago. His debut match was on 14 January 2007, a 2–1 win over Cuba. Loizeau scored his first goal for Guadeloupe in the following group match, a 4–3 loss to Guyana on 16 January 2007.

"Martin Archer (born 9 March 1957) is an English jazz saxophonist and electronic musician. Archer entered the British improvisational jazz scene at age 15. His first working band was Bass Tone Trap, with which he recorded an album in the early 1980s. In 1983 he founded the band Hornweb, which released three albums. He also released a solo album called Wild Pathway Favourites in 1988 on his own label, Discus. In 1993, Archer disbanded Hornweb, temporarily gave up the saxophone, and adopted synthesizers and electronic music. His first solo album in this new style was Ghost Lily Cascade in 1996. His usual recording method is to record jazz musicians as they improvise on acoustic instruments, and then reconstruct the results electronically. He has since released more than 20 solo albums, usually on his Discus label, which sells both his own records and those by other selected artists via mail order. His 2019 album, Another Fantastic Individual, was recorded entirely solo.

"The Navy Pay Office also known as the Navy Treasury was established in 1546. The office was administered by the Treasurer of the Navy, and was semi-autonomous of the Navy Office. It existed until 1835 when all offices and accounting departments of the Royal Navy were unified into the Department of the Accountant-General of the Navy. The Navy Pay Office received money directly from HM Treasury. The Navy Pay Office (NPO) was established in 1546, it was administered by the Treasurer of the Navy and existed until 1835 when all finance and accounting offices and departments of the Royal Navy were centralized into a single department under the Accountant-General of the Navy. The office was responsible processing naval finance including payments to flag officers, other commissioned officers and non-commissioned naval personnel and including the Victualling Office. The work of its staff was divided into a number of branches with specific areas of responsibility, these were overseen by the paymaster of the navy, the inspector of seamen's wills and the captains comptrolling payments of ships at Portsmouth, Plymouth and the Nore. The Navy Pay Office (domain of the Treasurer of the Navy and the Paymaster of the Navy) was independent of the Navy Board; though the board's commissioners were required to authorize payments, all funds transferred from HM Treasury were held and issued by the Navy Pay Office (which was also known as the Naval Treasury). The Navy Pay Office consisted of a number of specific departments and offices that included: Each branch within the Navy Pay Office was administered by a Chief Clerk each had a head cashier together with other supporting staff.",Normal

"Terme Taurine, also known as the Taurine Baths, is a large elaborate ancient Roman baths complex located about 4 km east of the city of Civitavecchia. They are also known as the Baths of Trajan as they may form part of Trajan's villa of Centumcellae nearby, due to their enormous size relative to the town and to their elaborate marble decoration. The limits of the site have yet to be explored which may clarify their history. The baths are now in an archaeological park. Terme Taurine was first established on a hill overlooking Civitavecchia during the Roman Republican era in 86 BC. They were built over thermal sulphurous springs a few km from the later port of Centumcellae developed by Trajan (r. 98 to 117 AD). They were also about 1 km from the earlier baths of the settlement of Aquae Tauri. The complex was greatly expanded by Roman emperors Trajan and Hadrian (r. 117 - 138) from 123 to 136. The baths became a popular stop-over site for visitors to the nearby port. It may have been named after Titus Statilius Taurus, prefect of Rome and builder of the first amphitheatre there, who fought with Augustus at Actium and had a patron role. In 416 Rutilius Namatianus wrote: There the wells are not spoiled by a brackish flavour, nor is the water coloured and hot with fuming sulphur: the pure smell and delicate taste make the bather hesitate for what purpose the waters should better be used Terme Taurine remained in use until the mid 6th century, and Pope Gregory the Great writes of them in 593. The wars between the Goths and Byzantine Empire resulted in them being looted. Much of the marble walling of the baths was stripped off, and the baths fell into disuse. In 1770 the Papal States began to excavate parts of the site and built an Italian-style garden nearby, which can still be seen. The baths reopened to the public in 2020 after a brief period of restoration. Local notables have proposed Terme Taurine be nominated as a UNESCO world heritage site. Commodus upon finding his bathwater lukewarm while visiting Terme Taurine ordered the stoker to be thrown into the furnace although a sheep skin was secretly substituted to replicate the burnt smell. Roman Poet Rutilius Claudius Namatianus visited the baths in 416 and described them in his travelogue. The site has two separate large baths areas: the republican and the later imperial baths. The baths featured changing rooms, and hot and cold pools. Several of these pools and the mosaics adorning them can still be visited. The republican baths were entered through an atrium with a mosaic floor depicting stars and diamonds. This led to the large exedra (semicircular hall) (7) probably for changing and exercise, with the ""small exedra"" adjacent to it. The oldest room of the baths was the adjacent domed round bath (4) of the 2nd century BC originally fed by hot spring water. Under Hadrian the bath was converted into a laconicum or sudatorium (dry heat bath) by supporting a new marble floor on brick columns for heating from below. These baths had a large additional suite of rooms which surrounded a peristyle garden (1) with octagonal columns. On the west of the peristyle are many rooms paved with mosaic floors for various activities such as social and business meetings and therapeutic treatments. The caldarium was, unusually, divided with two rows of travertine columns resembling a basilica, with a large central hot bath and with three small bathtubs on the sides between the columns. It was fed by hot water from a sulfurous spring. Nozzles allowed excess water from the pool to flow into the bathtubs, thus keeping the water level constant. Under Hadrian the columns were replaced and strengthened by embedded half-pillars to support a coffered and vaulted roof. Underneath the vault a terrace with pavilion roof (some sort of walkway) was built. The room was decorated with beautiful marbles and Ionic capitals. At the end of the caldarium is an apse with a rectangular niche, almost completely restored, in which is a marble altar with a dedication in Greek to the Nymphs, put there by Alcibiades, a freedman of Hadrian. Two shelves at its sides probably supported the small columns of a votive niche holding the simulacrum of some water deities, perhaps the water nymphs, who were believed by the Romans to be the guardian spirits of underground springs. The adjacent imperial baths were even larger than the republican baths. The large imperial calidarium (10) measured 23x9 m. A large swimming pool took up most of the room and white marble slabs covered the pool and the walls. A series of alternating square and semi-circular niches made the structure seem lighter and the windows in the niches let in the sunlight. The window panes were anchored to their wooden frames with molten lead. A piping system supplied the large pool with thermal water at 47°C. Piers (suspensura) supported the floor of the pool, insulating it to keep the water warm. It was covered by a coffered vaulted ceiling, with stucco decorations. At the south side was a large suite of rooms for leisure and business activities and services. Between these and the baths was a library, a large room decorated with several kinds of marble and a porphyry floor. Marble columns separated niches in the walls containing shelves for the library scrolls and papers. Two side rooms were probably used as reading rooms with couches in the alcoves at the back. There were also shops in the building. The Hadrianic part can be identified by some characteristic decorative elements and above all by at least five individual latrines as in Hadrian's Villa, which may have been reserved for use by VIPs such as the emperor. Some can be found in the vicinity of the large calidarium and in the cryptoporticus, one is near the winter triclinium with hypocaust. 42°06′34″N 11°50′08″E﻿ ﻿42.10947245°N 11.83549948°E﻿ 42.10947245; 11.83549948",Normal
"Krzysztof Michał Bednarski (KMB) (25 July 1953 in Kraków) is a contemporary Polish-Italian sculptor. He was one of three sons of Irena and Jerzy Bednarski. Before the war, his parents lived in Lwów on Kulparkowska Street. Bednarski completed the XIV High School of General Gottwald in Warsaw. Later he graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw (1973-1978) in the sculpture department in the studios of Jerzy Jarnuszkiewicz and Oskar Nikolai Hansen. His diploma was entitled Portret Totalny Karola Marksa (Karol Marx's Total Portrait) and was defended on July 5, 1978. He was later associated with the theater of Jerzy Grotowski, for which, during the period from 1976-1981, he designed posters. At that time, his first son was born and he worked at the quarry in Borów. Since 1986, he has been living in Rome, Italy. In the academic year 199697 and 2014-2017 he was a guest lecturer at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. In 2014, he defended his doctorate at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw for his work W stronę rzeźby, czyli historia jednego dzieła bez końca (In the direction of sculpture, the story of endless work on one subject). In his early work, he criticized the communist propaganda in Portret totalny Karola Marksa (1978) (Total Portrait of Karl Marx) which is currently in the collection of the Museum of Independence in Warsaw or in Portret zbiorowy (1980) (Collective Portrait) which is currently part of the collection of the National Museum in Warsaw. He alluded to the political situation in Poland under the martial law in work such as Victoria-Victoria (1983) which is now part of the collection of the National Museum in Kraków. One of the recurring motifs in his oeuvre is Moby-Dick; its 1987 installation is currently in the ms2 collection of the Art Museum in Łódź. Bednarski acted in several movies such as Noc poślubna w biały dzień (1982) (The Wedding Night During the Daylight), Schodami w górę, schodami w dół (1988) (Walking the Steps Up and Steps Down) and he played himself in My Italy (2017). He is married to Marina Fabbri with whom he has a son, Federico. From a previous marriage with Barbara Kiszakiewicz, he has a son, Jakub. In 1976 he began to design posters for theater projects of the Jerzy Grotowski Institute in Wrocław, and in the early 1980s, also film and theater posters. An example is a 1983 poster for the film debut of Waldemar Dziki Kartka z Podróży or a poster for the play in Teatr Studio ""I, Bruno Schulz"" directed by Jerzy Grzegorzewski. Most of his posters are collected in Muzeum Plakatu in warsaw. Since 1980 he exhibited posters during the International Poster Biennale in Warsaw. Bednarski exhibited his works in over one hundred individual exhibitions including: Gravity (dedicated to Tymoteusz Karpowicz), Galeria Awangarda, BWA, Wrocław (2016), Pamięci Ryszarda Cieślaka, Instytut J. Grotowskiego, Wrocław (2015), Pieśń z aluminium, Galeria Raster, Warszawa (2014), Widmo krąży, kurator: Achille Bonito Oliva, Narodowa Akademia Sztuk Ukrainy, Kijów (Kyiv, 2013); Egzorcyzmy, BWA, Opole (2013); Moby Dick – Opera Aperta, Państwowa Galeria Sztuki, Sopot (2013); Moby Dick – Rzeźba, Galeria aTAK, Warszawa (20122013); I coraz więcej bieli Galeria Foksal w Warszawie (2012); Prace z lat 1978-2008, Muzeum Narodowe we Wrocławiu; Thanatos polacco.

Bednarski's works can be found in the collections of many museums, including: the National Museum in Kraków, Poznań, Szczecin, Warsaw, Wrocław, Muzeum Sztuki in Łódź, Center for Contemporary Art Ujazdowski Castle in Warsaw, Zachęta National Gallery of Art in Warsaw, MHŻP POLIN, MOCAK in Kraków, Center of Polish Sculpture in Orońsko, Mazovian Center for Contemporary Art Elektrownia in Radom, Silesian Museum in Katowice, Museum of Independence in Warsaw, Upper Silesian Museum in Bytom, Museum of the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, Studio Gallery in Warsaw, Galeria Arsenał in Bialystok, District Museum Leon Wyczółkowski in Bydgoszcz, collections of the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts in Lublin, Łódź and Wrocław, the Foksal Gallery collection, in Warsaw, the Poster Museum in Wilanów, PKO Bank Polski in Warsaw, the Museum of Polish History in Warsaw, and in MAAM in Rome, Foundation Giorgio Franchetti in Rome, Foundation Federico Fellini in Rimini, Foundation Morra in Naples, Foundation Orestiadi in Gibellina in Sicily, Foundation Mario Schifano in Rome, Targetti Light Art Collection in Florence, International Art Collection in Certosa di Padulla, Italy, Leube Foundation, Salzburg-Gartenau, Art Museum in Rauma, Finland, Art.Omi Foundation, New York, Kathryn & Marc LeBaron, Lincoln, US. He was awarded several scholarships from the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage. In 19881989, he received a scholarship from the Italian government. Bednarski won the Katarzyna Kobro Award in 2004 and received an award from the EXIT quarterly magazine - Nowa sztuka in Poland (2005) and Golden Owl Award of Polonia, Vienna (2012). In December 2017, he received Premiazione del Franco Cuomo International Award (Franco Cuomo International Award) from the Italian Senate. He was decorated in Poland with Medal for Merit to Culture – Gloria Artis. Portret Karola Marksa (Portrait of Karl Marx) was Bednarski's diploma thesis, which he defended in 1978 at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. The author assembled a large photographic documentary collection and created Marx's head in many different sizes. The portrait was considered a critique of communist propaganda. Bednarski continues to create ""Marxes"" in various incarnations throughout his subsequent career as a total project adding objects to Marx's head or multiplying it typically as a commentary on social, political as well as his private life. Signs is a series of monuments based on the left hand of the author. Maryla Sitkowska, a longtime critic and archivist of Bednarski's work, describes them as sculptures of the hand which makes a special gesture. For example, Ticket shows an extended hand presenting a ticket. The most famous of Bednarski's gesture is Victoria-Victoria, sculpture of victory sign with cut fingers created during the Martial law in Poland (1981-1983). One of the versions of this sculpture was created in 1983 in France during the sculpting symposium in Digne-les-Bains. The sculpture shows V sign (of victory and freedom), but with the fingers cut off. The first version of this sculpture was created in Poland couple of years before. Bednarski writes about the series of Moby-Dick works: Working on Moby Dick completely changed my thinking about sculpture and space. There has been a rapid re-evaluation of my sculptural language  Suddenly I felt the ""freedom opening"". I knew that I found the foundation of my sculpture. In 1986, he found the hull of a large boat in the snow on the Vistula river which he thought resembled the white whale from the novel of Herman Melville. The hull was cut into sixteen parts, in the act of deconstruction, and was subsequently reconstructed in the attic of the palace on Krakowskie Przedmiescie Avenue in Warsaw. Until 2014, Moby-Dick was presented in over ten museum spaces, creating, according to Bednarski: completely new relationships stimulating interactions between the object and the place. The author writes that his works from the Moby-Dick series create a long lasting passage that led him through art and life. This series of works formed the basis of his doctorate at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw in 2014. In the summer of 1980, during the sculptural symposium Granit organized by Zagłębie Miedziowe (June 20, 1980 - August 20, 1980), Bednarski sculpted Krawężnik (A Curb) - sculpture dedicated to stonemason Jan Szeliga. The sculpture was created while working in the quarries of Gniewków and presents a schematic profile of the human head stretched over the entire length of the stone. The profile of Szliga's face is visible at the edge of the curb in the form of a shadow falling on the ground. The monument is currently exhibited in the village of Chocianów. Later, this idea of shadow projection was applied by Bednarski in the monument to Federico Fellini Incontro con Federico Fellini made in 1994. In the years 1989-1992, Bednarski developed a series of works based on the poetry of Dylan Thomas, in particular on the poem Vision and Prayer (V&P) which is written in the form of an hourglass. Bednarski created a number of relief plaques, works on paper and canvas and sculptures that transform this motif. Sphinx is a sculpture made from matchboxes. The author started to build it in early May 1984 during the economic collapse in Poland. Construction of the Sphinx required acquisition of about ten thousand matchboxes. At the time this represented an enormous effort, as they were rationed. In an ironic way, the Sphinx was dedicated to great builders from the Pharaohs to Joseph Stalin. The construction of the Sphinx took three months and the artist's mother said at one point: Son, I'm afraid for you, please leave these shitty matchboxes. I talked to your brothers, they will borrow the money and buy a marble block for you so that you can carve something decent. Nevertheless, the sculpture is currently in the Polish Sculpture Center in Orońsko. He is the creator of tombstones for Konstanty Puzyna, Krzysztof Kieślowski, Ryszard Cieślak (Osobowice Cemetery, Wrocław), Wojciech Fangor (2017, Powązki Military Cemetery), Krzysztof Krauze (2017, in Kazimierz Dolny), and monuments Incontro con Federico Fellini (Rimini, 1994), Fryderyk Chopin's La note bleue (Vienna, 2010), Stefan Kuryłowicz (Warsaw 2013), and sculptures named Thanatos Polski (1984) (collection of the National Museum in Wroclaw), dedicated to the memory of friends from the Laboratory Theater of Jerzy Grotowski. In an interview in the magazine Odra, Bednarski said that the best last favor for someone who was close to him was to make him a good tombstone.",Normal

"A bucksaw is a hand-powered frame saw similar to bow saw and generally used with a sawbuck to cut logs or firewood to length (bucking). Modern bucksaws usually have a metal frame (""H"" or ""C""-shaped) and a removable blade with coarse teeth held in tension by the frame. Lightweight portable or foldable models used for camping or back-packing are also available. It is often referred to as a bow saw in the North American hardware market, but that term traditionally refers to a different type of saw with a wooden frame. A bucksaw is a crosscut saw: it is designed to cut across the grain. The width of the blade is constant from the teeth to the back. It is meant to cut wood fibers that are under tension, and is thick so that it is more difficult to bend on the push stroke. It can be either a one or two-man saw. Coopers often use bucksaws in their work. Bucksaws can be used for a number of tasks like clearing land, chopping firewood, cutting lumber, and sometimes kept handy for small logging projects. Due to their portability, these hand tools are often preferred by people that like to go camping and enjoy the outdoors lifestyle. Bucksaws feature coarse teeth that allow them to work with very big timber and are designed to allow replacing the blades after extensive woodworking projects. If people use them for furnishing crafts, the blades can be substituted with more polished ones. The cuts produced with these smaller toothed blades are smoother and cleaner. The advantage of this tool is that electric power (or cord) is not needed to use it, and its affordability makes easily replaceable. This tool article is a stub.

"The Great Resignation, also known as the Big Quit and the Great Reshuffle, was a mainly American economic trend in which employees voluntarily resigned from their jobs en masse, beginning in early 2021 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the most cited reasons for resigning included wage stagnation amid rising cost of living, limited opportunities for career advancement, hostile work environments, lack of benefits, inflexible remote-work policies, and long-lasting job dissatisfaction. Most likely to quit were workers in hospitality, healthcare, and education. Some economists have described the Great Resignation as akin to a general strike, especially with regards to retail workers. However, workforce participation in some regions had returned to or even exceeded the pre-pandemic rate. This suggests that instead of remaining out of the workforce for extended periods (which can be financially difficult, especially at a time of high inflation), many workers were simply swapping jobs. Some regretted quitting their old positions. The term ""Great Resignation"" was coined by Anthony Klotz, a professor of management at University College London's School of Management, in May 2021, when he predicted a sustained mass exodus. In response, businesses have increased the rate of automation, creating a boom in robotics and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, while workers might feel empowered by being able to quit as soon as they see fit, they might struggle to climb up the career ladder due to their lack of experience and professional connections. Klotz later predicted the plateauing of the quit rate in 2023, and the end of the Great Resignation. Indeed, by mid-2023, the quit rate has more or less returned to what it was in 2019. Between December 2000, when quit rates were first measured by the United States Department of Labor, and February 2021, roughly a year following the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. resignation rate never surpassed 2.4% of the total workforce per month. High quit rates indicate worker confidence in the ability to get higher paying jobs, which typically coincides with high economic stability and low unemployment rates. Conversely, during periods of high unemployment, resignation rates tend to decrease as hire rates also decrease. For example, during the Great Recession, the U.S. quit rate decreased from 2.0% to 1.3% as the hire rate fell from 3.7% to 2.8%. Resignation rates in the U.S. during the pandemic initially followed this pattern. In March and April 2020, a record 13.0 and 9.3 million workers (8.6% and 7.2%) were laid off, and the quit rate subsequently fell to a seven-year low of 1.6%. Much of the layoffs and resignations were driven by women, who disproportionately work in industries that were affected most by the lock-downs, like service industries and childcare. As the pandemic continued, however, workers began to quit their jobs in large numbers despite initially high unemployment. According to Microsoft's Work Trend Index, more than 40% of the global workforce considered quitting their job in 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic allowed workers to rethink their careers, work conditions, and long-term goals. As many workplaces attempted to bring their employees in-person, workers desired the freedom that remote work afforded them during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as schedule flexibility, which was the primary reason to look for a new job of the majority of those studied by Bankrate in August 2021. Additionally, many workers, particularly in younger cohorts, are seeking to gain a better work–life balance. In the U.S., connections are also being drawn to reported increases in workplace stress and employee burnout. Moreover, millions of people now have long COVID; this disability can alter the ability or desire to work. Lambert (2022) finds that the concept of labor market segmentation is useful in explaining resignation rates across different industries. Restaurants and hotels, industries that require in-person interactions, have been hit the hardest by waves of resignations. COVID-19 stimulus payments and rises in unemployment benefits allowed those who relied on low-wage jobs for survival to stay home, although places where unemployment benefits were rolled back did not see significant job creation as a result. On the other hand, many workers who felt dissatisfied with their jobs reported that they cannot resign due to economic barriers, many of these workers being people of color. Sekou Siby, president and CEO of the U.S. nonprofit Restaurant Opportunities Center United, commented, ""There's more competition across industries, so workers are feeling more empowered than ever before, but that doesn't mean everyone is able to leave their current jobs."" According to a study conducted by Adobe, the exodus is being driven by Millennials and Generation Z, who were more likely to be dissatisfied with their work. More than half of Gen Z reported planning to seek a new job within the next year. Harvard Business Review found that the cohort between 30 and 45 years old had the greatest increase in resignation rates. Racial minority, low-wage, and frontline workers are also more dissatisfied with their work in the United States, according to the asset management firm Mercer. An IMF working paper by Carlo Pizzinelli and Ippei Shibata focused on causes of the loss in employment within the U.S. and U.K. labor markets in comparison to pre-COVID-19 levels. They identified job mismatch (that is, mismatch between the areas where people search for work and where the most vacancies are) as playing a ""modest"" role, being less significant than in the wake of the global financial crisis. The effect of the pandemic on women, sparking the so-called ""She-cession"", was deemed as accounting for some 16% of the total U.S. employment shortfall but little to none of the shortfall in the U.K. Meanwhile, the authors attribute 35% of the shortfall in both the U.K. and U.S. to older workers (aged 55–74) withdrawing from the labor force. On the other side, Harvard Business Review reported resignation rates for those aged 60–70 actually fell in 2021 (in comparison to 2020 rates). Some suggested that the tightness of the labor market was not due to workers resigning en masse or turning towards self-employment, but instead due to a shortage of migrant workers caused by travel restrictions during the pandemic and a general rise in anti-immigrant sentiment. There is disagreement as to whether or not the Great Resignation will have a lasting effect. Although quit rates remain high, many workers in Western countries have been returning to the labor force in large numbers in late 2021 and early 2022. In general, an aging population and a labor shortage accelerate industrial automation, not just to replace the ""missing"" workers but also to cut costs. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a total of 47 million Americans quit their jobs in 2021. Resignations are consistently the most prevalent in the South, where 2.9% of the workforce voluntarily left their jobs in June, followed by the Midwest (2.8%) and the West (2.6%). The Northeast is the most stable region, with 2.0% of workers quitting in June. The stimulus checks likely provided the financial security needed for many workers to voluntary resign their positions. According to a PricewaterhouseCoopers survey conducted in early August 2021, 65% of employees said they were looking for a new job and 88% of executives said their company was experiencing higher turnover than normal. A Deloitte study published in Fortune magazine in October 2021 found that among Fortune 1000 companies, 73% of CEOs anticipated the work shortage would disrupt their businesses over the next 12 months, 57% believed attracting talent is among their company's biggest challenges, and 35% already expanded benefits to bolster employee retention. Workers in the leisure and hospital industries had relatively high quit rates. In October 2021, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that food service workers' quit rates rose to 6.8%, which is well above the industry average of 4.1% over the last 20 years and still higher than the industry's quit peaks of 5% in 2006 and 2019. The retail industry had the second highest quit rates at 4.7%. From the start of the pandemic to November 2021, approximately one in five healthcare workers quit their jobs. Amidst the Great Resignation, October 2021 saw a strike wave known as Striketober, with over 100,000 American workers participating in or preparing for strike action. While discussing Striketober, some economists described the Great Resignation as workers participating in a general strike against poor working conditions and low wages. By August 2022, however, the U.S. workforce had surpassed its size from before the COVID-19 pandemic. Many American workers took advantage of the labor shortage to trade their current jobs for those with higher salaries, more benefits, and better schedules. Some have started or joined labor unions. A number of prospective employers are also offering paid training in order to attract recruits. Still, the recovery of employment has been uneven, as low-wage sectors—especially leisure, hospitality, retail, manufacturing, and education—lose jobs to those that offer higher income. Although retirees (who need to supplement their incomes) have returned at a rate not seen since 2019, it remains unclear whether workers aged 55 and over, people more likely to quit, will ever return. Many older workers decided to retire during the pandemic, continuing a long-term trend in the U.S. labor market of growing rates of voluntary quitting dating back to 2009. Unsatisfied with their current positions, a record number of Americans quit to start their own businesses, only to face an acute labor shortage they helped to create. In fact, small businesses are the most likely to struggle to find qualified recruits. Some 16 million Americans suffer from long COVID, and of these, 2 to 4 million are kept out of work because if it. The shortage of workers has exacerbated the disruption of the domestic supply chain of the United States. In response to the problem, a number of firms have relocated to states with lower costs of doing business (and possibly with subsidies), a large pool of skilled workers, quality education, high standards of living, and good infrastructure. Wage growth has jumped; in December 2021, wage growth reached 4.5%, the highest since June 2001. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), U.S. GDP per capita in 2023 will be 4.6% higher than what it was in 2019. The number of workers in positions earning less than US$29,000 has fallen noticeably compared to January 2020. Some employers in the fast food industry, like McDonald's, are providing more benefits, like college scholarships and healthcare benefits, to bring back workers. In 2023, the labor participation rate of Americans aged 15 to 64 has exceeded peak before the pandemic, already the highest since 2007. Still, although inflation remains high, many service-sector workers who got laid off during the pandemic have not returned. Public sector jobs have had higher worker retention as compared to private sector jobs, largely due to stronger benefits like paid family leave. However, some Americans have regretted leaving their old jobs as they are unsatisfied with their new positions, especially Generation Z, while businesses are not always keen to re-hire those who have quit, questioning their motives and loyalty. Economic productivity has dropped during the Great Resignation because even when employees stay, they are not as productive as they were in the past. In order to counter the effects of a labor shortage, many American companies, especially those in the automotive, restaurant, and food delivery industries, have opted to invest more in automation. The robotics industry is booming as a result. In the entertainment industry, artificial intelligence is becoming an increasingly popular tool for reducing labor and cutting costs. The early 2020s also saw faculty members are leaving academia for good, especially those from the humanities. In the life sciences, many postdoctoral fellows have left academia for industry, which offers better salaries. (Also see the higher education bubble in the United States and elite overproduction.) By March 2023, the Great Resignation showed signs of petering out with fewer people quitting their positions as the job market became more competitive. Employers no longer needed to offer as many benefits in order to fill vacancies. Wage growth has slowed. The retail and hospitality industries saw quit rates returning to pre-pandemic levels. Many workers were actually working two jobs in order to make ends meet or because they are anxious about the state of the economy. Although unemployment remains under four percent and job growth continues to be positive, fears of a possible recession and improved working conditions have prompted many employees to stay where they are, leading to a drop in the monthly rate of quitting. By July 2023, there were signs that of significant expansion of the U.S. labor force thanks to women of prime working age, disabled people, and immigrants (both legal and illegal) seeking employment. Economist Anthony Klotz indicated in February 2023 that the quit rate has fallen as if the pandemic never happened. However, he noted that the health care, retail, transportation and industries were still facing a labor shortage, and that 2019 still saw a historically high rate of quitting. Nevertheless, by the end of 2023, the balance of power in the job market has shifted in favor of employers as hiring cooled and fewer vacancies were available. In February 2022, Australian treasurer Josh Frydenberg reported that the labor market had been experiencing a ""Great Reshuffle"" rather than a ""Great Resignation"". He also reported that over one million workers started new jobs in the three months prior to November 2021, an increase of almost 10% prior to the pre-pandemic average. In the three months prior to February 2022, 300,000 workers reported resigning for better job opportunities, a record number. A main incentive may have been higher pay, as the typical Australian worker who switched jobs received a pay bump of 8% to 10%. A similar social protest movement is occurring in China, referred to as tang ping (Chinese: 躺平; lit. 'lying flat'). It started roughly during the same time as the Great Resignation, in April 2021. It is a rejection of societal pressures to overwork, such as in the 996 working hour system. Those who participate in tang ping instead choose to ""lie down flat and get over the beatings"" via a low-desire, more indifferent attitude towards life. Business magazine ABC Money claimed the lifestyle resonated with youth disillusioned by the government-endorsed ""Chinese Dream"", which encourages a life of hard work and sacrifice without life satisfaction to show for it. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has worked to reject the idea through state-owned media and internet censorship, though some party voices offer that the movement provides an opportunity to reflect on how best to cultivate diligence in young generations. A survey by HR company SD Worx of 5,000 people in Belgium, France, the U.K., Germany, and the Netherlands, found that employees in Germany had the most COVID-19-related resignations, with 6.0% of the workers leaving their jobs. This was followed by the United Kingdom with 4.7%, the Netherlands with 2.9%, and France with 2.3%. Belgium had the least number of resignations with 1.9%. Some preliminary data show an increase in the number of quits in Italy, starting in the second quarter of 2021. The registered increase was not only in absolute terms, but also in terms of quit rate (computed as quits over employed population) and of quit share (computed as quits over total contract terminations). In the United Kingdom between July and September 2021, over 400,000 workers left their jobs, up from 270,000 two years prior. There were a record high 1.3 million job vacancies in December 2021, or 4.4 vacancies for every 100 jobs. The U.K. workforce got smaller in 2020, the first time in over twenty years, largely due to older people retiring according to Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies. Between October and December 2021, the rate of U.K. workers aged 16 to 64 moving job-to-job was at an all-time high of 3.2%. Workers in their 30s (Millennials) are the most likely to quit their jobs, followed by those in their 20s (Generation Z). However, by August 2022, many British workers have returned to their previous positions after quitting and some elderly Britons have opted out of retirement in order to pay their bills in the wake of high inflation. Some industries, like nursing, have been hit especially hard by burnout. In October 2021, before the Omicron variant caused a new wave of cases, the Royal College of Nursing conducted a survey of over 9,000 British nursing staff in which 57% of respondents were either thinking about leaving or actively planning to leave their jobs. The primary factors reported were feeling undervalued, exhausted, and not being able to give adequate care. India has witnessed large scale resignations across many sectors of the economy. The information technology sector in particular witnessed massive attrition, with over a million resignations in 2021. Fans and media outlets drew connections between the Great Resignation and Beyoncé's 2022 song ""Break My Soul"", specifically in the verse ""Now I just fell in love And I just quit my job"". The South Park episode ""DikinBaus Hot Dogs"" features a plot in which businesses are able to hire children due to the labor shortage caused by the Great Resignation.

The series was well received by readers, who found Kazu cute and appealing. Josou o Yamerarenaku Naru Otokonoko no Hanashi is a romantic comedy manga following Kazu, a young man who secretly has enjoyed his cross-dressing hobby for half a year. He contemplates how he would like to be called cute and treated as if he were a woman, but how he is worried about someone finding out that he likes being feminine, when his best friend Masaru walks in on him while he is wearing women's clothes. Confused by Kazu's appearance, Masaru misunderstands the situation and asks if Kazu has become a woman like in the gender-swapping manga Kazu likes to read, and calls him cute; Kazu is so happy about it that he begins diligently working on improving his cross-dressing skills further, but keeps getting interrupted by Masaru when trying to explain that he is not a woman. Josou o Yamerarenaku Naru Otokonoko no Hanashi is written and illustrated by Kobashiko. As they enjoy gender-swap stories, they had originally planned to write a story about a transgender character, but decided to instead write about a male character dressing like a woman after deciding that Kazu does not have to be a woman to be cute. They wrote the story themed around the happiness stemming from dressing how one wants, describing it as something they believe is good for the soul, not only for cross-dressers. The series premiered on October 3, 2020, and is released by Kobashiko through their Twitter account. Publisher Kadokawa Shoten has released the series in print in collected tankōbon volumes under its MFC imprint since May 21, 2021, the first of which includes twenty additional pages of illustrations.

"Stephen Webb Raudenbush (born c. 1946) is the Lewis-Sebring Professor of Sociology and Chairman of the Committee on Education at the University of Chicago. He is best known for his development and application of hierarchical linear models (HLM) in the field of education but he has also published on other subjects such as health and crime. Hierarchical linear models, which go by many other names, are used to study many natural processes. To use an example from education, a three level hierarchical model might account for the fact that students are nested in classrooms which are nested in schools. With the right data one could go further and note that schools are nested in districts which are nested in states. Repeated measures of the same individuals can be studied with these models as observations nested in people. Raudenbush received an Ed.D. in Policy Analysis and Evaluation Research in 1984 from Harvard University. In subsequent years he made major contributions to education research. His work has earned him numerous honors. In 2006, he was awarded both the “Distinguished Contributions to Research in Education Award” and the “Robert Park Award,” for outstanding work in community and urban sociology.

"Ty'Son Williams (born September 4, 1996) is an American football running back who is a free agent. He played college football at North Carolina, South Carolina and BYU and went undrafted in the 2020 NFL Draft. Regarded as a four-star recruit out of Crestwood High School, Williams signed with North Carolina. He transferred to South Carolina after one year. In two seasons with the Gamecocks, Williams rushed for 799 yards. He entered the transfer portal as a graduate and came to BYU over offers from Fresno State and Marshall. In his first game against Utah, he was named the starting running back and had seven carries for 6.4 yards per carry. The following week, he rushed for 94 yards and was pushed across the goal line by the Cougar offensive line for the game-winning touchdown in a 29–26 double overtime win over Tennessee. Williams played in four games before tearing his ACL against Washington. He tallied 49 carries for 264 yards, an average of 5.4 yards per carry, and three touchdowns in addition to seven receptions for 47 yards. The Baltimore Ravens signed Williams on August 28, 2020. He was waived on September 5, 2020, and re-signed to the practice squad the next day. He was elevated to the active roster on December 2 for the team's week 12 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and reverted to the practice squad after the game.  On January 18, 2021, Williams signed a reservefutures contract with the Ravens. Originally set to be third on the depth chart, injuries to J. K. Dobbins, Justice Hill, and Gus Edwards set him up to start in the season opener against the Las Vegas Raiders. In the game, he had nine carries for 65yards, including 35yard run for his first professional touchdown, along with three receptions for 29yards. However, the Ravens lost in overtime 27–33. Williams quickly fell out of favor with the Ravens over the next few weeks and lost his starting role to Latavius Murray. On March 9, 2022, the Ravens placed an exclusive-rights free agent tender on Williams. However, the Ravens withdrew the tender on May 10, making him a free agent. On May 24, 2022, Williams signed with the Indianapolis Colts. He was waived on August 30, 2022. On October 12, 2022, Williams was signed to the Arizona Cardinals practice squad.

"Cricket for a Cause is a charitable cricket league in Dubai that has been taking place during Ramadan for the past two years. The league was founded by Ashar Yahya, a high school student at Dubai College. The league has a partnership with Cover Drive, an indoor sports facility in Dubai, the venue for the league. The league is endorsed and supported by Dubai Cares and the IAC. The inaugural edition of the event took place between the 21st of June 2015 and the 1st of July 2015. 8 teams participated in the event. The format was 6 overs6 players per side.

"Nancy WilsonCannonball Adderley is a studio album by Nancy Wilson and Cannonball Adderley issued in February 1962 by Capitol Records. The album rose to No. 30 on the Billboard Top LPs chart. Wilson considered her vocals on the album ""as a sort of easy-going third horn"" (Wilson quoted in the liner notes). All tracks were recorded in New York City, those with Wilson on June 27 and 29, 1961, and the instrumental tracks on August 23 and 24, 1961. The Penguin Guide to Jazz states: ""The odd session out is the date with Nancy Wilson for Capitol, primarily designed as a showcase for the young singer but with five band-only tracks as well. Wilson had a self-conscious phrasing and melodramatic lighting-up of key lines - but there is a version of 'A Sleeping Bee' here which is one of the most charming of all her recordings, and Cannon and the others play personably throughout."" The AllMusic review by David Nathan concluded: ""Given the play list and the outstanding artists performing it, why any serious jazz collection would be without this classic album is difficult to comprehend.""",Normal

"BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559 (1996), was a United States Supreme Court case limiting punitive damages under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiff, Dr. Ira Gore, bought a new BMW, and later discovered that the vehicle had been repainted before he bought it. Defendant BMW of North America revealed that their policy was to sell damaged cars as new if the damage could be fixed for less than 3% of the cost of the car. Dr. Gore sued, and an Alabama jury awarded $4,000 in compensatory damages (lost value of the car) and $4 million in punitive damages, which was later reduced to $2 million by the Alabama Supreme Court. The punitive damages resulted not only from Dr. Gore's damages, but from BMW's egregious behavior across a broad spectrum of BMW purchasers over a multi-year period of time in which BMW repaired damaged vehicles and sold them as new to unsuspecting buyers as a matter of routine business operation. The decision of the Alabama Supreme Court was then appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Whether excessively high punitive damages violate the Due Process clause of the Constitution. The Court, in an opinion by Justice Stevens, found that the excessively high punitive damages in this case violate the Due Process clause. For punitive damages to stand, the damages must be reasonably necessary to vindicate the State's legitimate interest in punishment and deterrence. Punitive damages may not be ""grossly excessive"" – if they are, then they violate substantive due process. The Supreme Court applied three factors in making this determination: Using these factors, the Court found that BMW's conduct was not particularly reprehensible (no reckless disregard for health or safety, nor even evidence of bad faith). The ratio of actual or potential damages to punitive damages was suspiciously high. Finally, the criminal sanctions available for similar conduct were limited to $2,000, making the $2 million assessment the equivalent of a severe criminal penalty. The Court noted, however, that these three factors can be over-ridden if it is ""necessary to deter future conduct"". Dissenting opinions were written by Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg, both contending that the Constitution was not implicated here, raising principles of federalism. On remand, the Supreme Court of Alabama ordered a new trial unless plaintiff accepted a remittitur of all but $50,000 of the punitive damages awarded. The court reasoned that it may not have given sufficient weight to the degree of reprehensibility of BMW's conduct, and selected the $50,000 as in the range of other Alabama verdicts in cases of repaired cars being sold as new. In an academic article, following the arguments raised by the dissenting justices, Patrick Hubbard has questioned the appropriateness of federal courts reading substantive rights into the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution in order to preempt the role of state courts and legislatures. These same people say the Court should not spend its time as a ""super jury"", second-guessing jury verdicts, but rather, ""he court should be more deferential to state courts and legislatures, and more concerned with developing a coherent framework.""",Normal

"Hazem El Beblawi (also spelled el Beblawy; Arabic: حازم عبد العزيز الببلاوى pronounced ; born 17 October 1936) is an Egyptian economist and politician who was interim prime minister of Egypt from 2013 until 1 March 2014. Previously he served as deputy prime minister and minister of finance in 2011. After the ouster of President Mohammed Morsi and his government in July 2013, Beblawi was named interim prime minister. On 24 February 2014, Beblawi announced his resignation. Beblawi was born in Cairo, Egypt, on 17 October 1936. He studied law at Cairo University and graduated in 1957. One of his teachers at Cairo University was Ismail Sabri Abdullah. Beblawi obtained a postgraduate degree in economics from the University of Grenoble in France in 1961. He also holds a PhD in economics, which he received from the Pantheon-Sorbonne University in 1964. Beblawi began his career as a lecturer at the University of Alexandria in 1965 and taught economy-related courses at several universities, including the University of Southern California, until 1980. He became a manager at the Industrial Bank of Kuwait in 1980, serving there until 1983. From 1983 to 1995, he was chairman and chief executive of the Export Development Bank in Egypt. He then worked at the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) as executive secretary from 1995 to 2000. Next, he served as an advisor to the Arab Monetary Fund in Abu Dhabi from 2001 to 2011. After the January–February 2011 Egyptian revolution, Beblawi became a founding member of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party. He was appointed to the government as deputy prime minister for economic affairs, as well as minister of finance, in a cabinet reshuffle on 17 July 2011. He succeeded Samir Radwan, who had served as finance minister since January 2011. The cabinet was headed by Prime Minister Essam Sharaf.

V. quenstedti has been found near Chile and around New Zealand, but is assumed to be widespread in the Southern Ocean on hard (rock) substrates. V. quenstedti is found in cryptic environments together with species of Novocrania. The largest specimen found is 6mm length, 7mm wide and 2½mm height. Both valves are very thin and translucent, have small pores (a state called punctate by science) and are obliquely conical in profile with the tip close to the straight posterior margin. The exteriors of the valves have irregular hummocks, and hollows with occasional pustules and some concentric growth lines. The valves vary in shape from subquadrate to subhexagonal, fitting the rock crevice in which it is growing. Some valves are encrusted by Spirorbis worm tubes. In adulthood, the dorsal valve has a concave rim up to 1mm wide. The outer edge is extremely thin, about 50 μm, and the interior lip of the rim is marked by a coarse granular ridge. The concave rim of the dorsal valve rests upon the convex rim of the ventral valve. The ventral valve convex rim also carries granules that probably interlock with those on the dorsal valve ridge. The posterior margin of the dorsal valve is straight and about 200 μm thick. The inside edge is rounded and fits into a straight posterior trough on the ventral valve, together acting as a hinge. Three pairs of muscle attachment ""scars"" are arranged in a hexagon, with the largest oval in shape and close to the straight posterior margin of the valves, small ones to the sides and crescent-shaped muscle ""scars"". The inside of the valves of V. quenstedti each carry two processes on both sides of the midline approximately at its centre, which may grow to almost 1mm long. During the growth of this brachiopod their shape changes from thorns on the inner surface, via tapering cylinders at an angle to the valve and slightly diverging mid-size, to transversely flattened, sub-parallel and erect. These are not the support of the lophophores, which are located to the side of these processes. The dorsal valve contains many pores (or punctae) in radial rows with tiny ridges between them. These punctae entirely perforate the shell, and split in branches outwards repeatedly within the extremely thin valve. The ventral valve is concave and much thicker near the margin than the dorsal valve (up to 1mm). It is cemented to the substrate. The raised margin is convex, of variable width (averaging around 1mm), and sometimes covered with granules. The slightly concave outermost rim is about 200 μm wide, smooth, and within it fits the dorsal valve. The posterior margin is a straight trough. In the central cavity of most specimens a wide ridge begins in the middle, gradually becomes wider and higher and ends steeply. In its centre the valve is very thin or even absent with the rock substrate showing through. This brachiopod-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",Normal
"The Danube is conventionally taken to be formed by the confluence of the two streams Brigach and Breg just east of Donaueschingen. The source of the Donaubach, which flows into the Danube, in Donaueschingen is often referred to as the source of the Danube (Donauquelle). Hydrologically, the source of the Danube is the source of the Breg as the larger of the two formative streams (with its spring at a higher altitude and - at the confluence - not only being 5km longer but also having a higher amount of water discharge) which rises near Furtwangen. There was an active rivalry between the municipalities of Furtwangen and Donaueschingen for the claim of being home to the ""official"" source of the Danube since the 1950s, sometimes with the involvement of the government of the state of Baden-Württemberg. Thus, in 1981 the state government granted Donaueschingen the request that the source in Furtwangen should no longer be labelled Donauquelle in official maps. The waters of rivers collect in a barely comprehensible number of headwaters, which gradually merge. The numerous merger points of each greater upstream river build the backbone of this type of drainage system and with that the source of the entire river. The main point or backbone of a river is sometimes defined by further features such as length, drainage area or steady flow direction. For a long time, unique springs which differed in size or the starting point of a certain headwater were also of mythical significance. This is reflected in sacred springs and water sanctuaries, and in the worship of Naiads. The source of the mightiest river in the Roman Empire was no exception. The Danube river, emanating from the Abnoba mountains, was considered to be a river or spring goddess. In contrast to the more mythical role, the hydrological significance of the source of the Danube is notably small; this is because a significant portion of the Danube's headwater is channelled into the Rhine, both above and below Tuttlingen (see also Danube Sinkhole). Consequently, it dries up for most of the year. Near Ulm, in terms of hydrology, the more water-rich Iller flows into the Danube as one of its tributaries. The Donaubach rises on the castle grounds near the left corner of the front face of the castle Donaueschingen in a karst spring. This karst spring has an embankment of 15 to 70 Ls and enters into the Brigach after flowing 90 meters belowground. The Brigach and the Breg become the Danube after 1.5km. The source is one of 22 sources in the area of the junction of Brigach and Berg. All of these sources are fed by both water which trickles away above them and rainfall which trickles away on the karstified downs of a landscape called Baar. Together, the Brigach and the Breg empty out between 400 and 1000 Ls. The Donaubach spring was considered the source of the Danube since the 15th century at least (Hartmann Schedel in his Weltchronik from 1493), but several hints suggest that this might have been true even in Roman times (Pliny the Elder in Naturalis Historia), in which the river was located in the fringes of the populated areas. The oldest cartographic depiction by Sebastian Münster from 1538 shows the Donaubach spring as a rectangular pool; in 1875, the spring was modelled into a round pool after Adolf Weinbrenner's design. In 1895 the artist Adolf Heer created a group of statues above the pool, depicting ""the mother Baar"" showing her ""daughter"", the young Danube, the way. The supposed source of the Danube is a popular tourist attraction. Similar springs on tributary rivers include the Neckar spring, the Enzbrunnen, the Pegnitz spring and the Berkel spring. The spring of the river Breg is situated in the north of Furtwangen next to the St. Martin's Church near the Kolmenhof (restaurant). The Breg is for geographical and hydrological reasons longer and has a bigger water flow than the Brigach which is why its spring is the main origin of the upper Danube. The dominance of the Breg is established by the following data: As early as 1847 the following definition can already be found in the Universallexikon des Großherzogtums Baden (Universal Lexicon of the Grand Duchy of Baden): ""Danube, the biggest river of Germany, rises at the Martinskapelle in a wild and lonely area of the Black Forest, is called Brege at its origin and forms the river Danube in Donaueschingen where it is unified with the Brigach."" (German original: ""Donau, der größte Fluß Deutschlands, entspringt bei der Martinskapelle in einer wilden und einsamen Gegend des Schwarzwaldes, heißt am Anfang Brege... und bildet erst in Donaueschingen, wo sie sich mit der Brigach vereinigt, die Donau."") The identification of the main spring in the uppermost Bregtal (also called Katzensteig) is dependent on a defining convention: Instead of localizing the main spring in Gewann Briglirain (also called Brücklerain) it is, because of length and drainage measurements from the 1950s, localized at the Martinskapelle in Gewann today. This part of the river carries more water and has a bigger drainage but partly trickles away, especially in dry weather conditions, into the rubble at the bottom of the valley. This is no concern for the choice of this part of the river but for the height of the spring as a perennial outflow. The river Danube properly begins with the confluence of the two headwater streams Brigach and Breg in the region of Donaueschingen. The river flows on from there into the delta of the Black Sea, after 2811km. In 1949 Franz Burgert from Furtwangen argued for the spring near St. Martin's Church being the origin of the Breg, instead of the spring near Briglirain. This was also underpinned in the 1950s by the investigations of geologist Irma Öhrlein, which were later meticulously continued by Ludwig Öhrlein. The question of what is the spring of the Danube also interested the oceanographer Jacques Cousteau, who in 1987 filmed a documentary about the Danube around St. Martin's Church. For centuries, the two cities Furtwangen and Donaueschingen competed for an official status which declares their own source as the official source of the Danube. The city Furtwangen is located along the upper river Breg, while the city Donaueschingen is located at the symbolic source of the Danube. At times, the issue even involves the government of Baden-Württemberg. After the city council Donaueschingen intervened in 1981, for example, the Ministry of the Interior in Stuttgart announced that ""the source of the Breg is not anymore displayed as the source of the Danube on ministerial maps. The land surveying office was instructed to act accordingly."" However, the former minister for agriculture and forestry confirmed in a document addressed to Prof. Öhrlein in 1982: ""Getting back to the issue regarding the source of the Danube, I can once again confirm that the so-called source of the Danube in Donaueschingen is certainly not the real source of the river Danube, if analysed with geographical and hydrological criteria. The river Breg can rightly be called the main stream of the Danube."" 48°05′42″N 8°09′18″E﻿ ﻿48.0951°N 8.1549°E﻿ 48.0951; 8.1549",Normal

"Stauffer was an unincorporated community located in Lake County, Oregon, United States. The first homesteaders arrived in the area around 1910. By 1918, the local population was declining rapidly due to the harsh environment. Today, Stauffer is a ghost town with no population and no surviving structures. The site is located approximately 12 miles (19km) south of U.S. Route 20 between Bend and Burns, Oregon. The nearest inhabited place is Hampton, Oregon, 21 miles (34km) northwest of the Stauffer site. The Stauffer town site is in the Lost Creek Valley, in the northeast corner of Lake County. It is deep in Oregon’s remote high desert country. The site is located on an unimproved dirt road 12 miles (19km) south of Route 20, approximately 70 miles (110km) southeast of Bend and 50 miles (80km) southwest of Burns. The elevation at the site is 4,570 feet (1,390m) above sea level. Stauffer is just a few miles south of Glass Buttes, which is well known for its extensive obsidian deposits. The buttes are a major landmark, rising well above the surrounding high desert plain with a topographic prominence of approximately 2,000 feet (610m). Snow melt from the southern slopes of Glass Buttes drains into the Lost Creek Valley where Stauffer is located. It was common for Stauffer area homesteaders to collect obsidian from Glass Buttes. In the high desert country around the Stauffer site, the soil is thin and alkaline. Rainfall is limited, just 8 inches (20cm) to 10 inches (25cm) per year. As a result, vegetation is sparse, consisting mainly of sagebrush and bunchgrass with widely dispersed western juniper in some areas. The first settlers arrived in the Stauffer area around 1910. They were drawn there by the promise of free land made available by the Homestead Act of 1909. Charles Albert Stauffer, his wife Maude, and their family of nine children moved to Oregon from Nebraska in 1910. After he arrived, Stauffer filed a homestead claim in the Lost Creek Valley. He quickly became a community leader. In addition to his ranch operation, Stauffer served as the community's postmaster. He was also a notary public and a United States Land Commissioner, who processed land claims for newly arrived homesteaders. In 1914, he started a weekly newspaper called the Stauffer Enterprise, but no record of the newspaper exists today. In 1918, Bill Brown, a wealthy sheep and horse rancher from neighboring Crook County, had Stauffer arrested for stealing sheep. Stauffer denied the charges, saying he was holding the sheep for a third party named Perry, who also claimed to own the animals. A grand jury decided not to indict Stauffer and all charges were dropped. Stauffer then filed a $50,000 malicious prosecution lawsuit against Brown. He later dropped the requested damages to $10,000. That claim went to trial, but the jury sided with Brown, rejecting Stauffer’s damage claim. Stauffer and his family left the Lost Creek Valley in 1919. They relocated to Bend. A year after moving to Bend, one of Stauffer’s six sons fell ill and died at age seventeen. In 1928, Charles and Maude Stauffer moved to Portland, Oregon, where they lived for the rest of their lives. Maude died there in 1936. Stauffer passed away at his home in Portland in 1943. Most of the initial homesteaders in the Stauffer area lived in tents for many months waiting for lumber to be shipped in from Bend or Prineville. Other settlers cut Juniper trees on the slopes of Glass Buttes for logs to build rustic cabins. Basic food products and other supplies were delivered by freight wagon from Bend every six months, a trip that took six days each way. Once the Stauffer homesteaders were settled in, they planted backyard gardens that provided fresh vegetables. Many also brought dairy cows to their homesteads to provide milk and to use for producing cheese. Hunting rabbits, deer, and antelope on the high desert range provided meat for homestead families. Also, community rabbit drives were important events in Stauffer. To brighten up their homes, many homesteaders decorated their rustic dwellings with obsidian gathers from sites around nearby Glass Buttes. Today, many abandoned homestead sites around Stauffer are marked by piles of obsidian collected by pioneer families. The Stauffer post office was opened on 13 September 1913. Residents originally wanted to name the post office Lost Creek. However, the United States postal system already had a post office with that name, so it was named after Charles Stauffer, who was the community’s first postmaster. The community centered around the Stauffer ranch and the adjacent post office. Beyond that, the Stauffer community never developed into much of a town. It had no general store, tavern, hotel, or any public buildings except the post office and a one-room schoolhouse. Alice Brookings was the first teacher at the Stauffer school. She later became postmistress when Stauffer left that position. Brookings ran the post office until 1917, when the post office was moved back to the Stauffer ranch. A few years after the initial rush of settlers arrived between 1910 and 1913, the lack of water and the harsh freezing winters, when temperatures often dropped to −25°F (−32°C), forced many homesteaders to abandon their Lost Creek Valley land claims. While mail deliveries from Bend had increased to twice a week by 1916, the exodus from the Lost Creek Valley homesteads had become pronounced. By 1918, only ten Stauffer residents voted in that year’s election. Charles Stauffer and Fred Donovan delivered the ballots to the Lake County seat in Lakeview, 90 miles (140km) south of the Lost Creek Valley. By 1922, the Stauffer mail route from Bend only served 25 families along the entire 70-mile (110km) route. Over the next decade, the enrollment at Stauffer’s school continued to shrink. By 1934, there were only five students in the school. The following year, the last two students left the Stauffer area and the school was closed. That same year, the Stauffer post office was closed and postal serve was transferred to Hampton, which was located on the main Route 20 highway between Bend and Burns. However, a postal substation was maintained at Stauffer until 1950, when all postal service to the Stauffer area was permanently discontinued. In 1943, the United States Army conducted a large-scale battle near the Stauffer town site as part of the Oregon Maneuver training exercise to prepare troops for combat in World War II. The Oregon Maneuver was one of the largest military training exercises ever conducted in the continental United States with over 100,000 soldiers and airmen participating. The last resident left Lost Creek Valley sometime in the 1950s. By 1977, only a few scattered remnants of homesteader cabins remained in the valley. Today, Stauffer is a ghost town with no population and no surviving structures. The nearest inhabited place is the small unincorporated community of Hampton, Oregon, which is located 21 miles (34km) northwest of the Stauffer site.",Normal

"The M3 Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicle (CFV) is an American tracked armored reconnaissance vehicle manufactured by BAE Systems Platforms & Services (formerly United Defense). A member of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle family, the M3 CFV is used by heavy armored cavalry units in the United States Army. The M3 Bradley CFV is very similar to the M2 Bradley IFV (Infantry Fighting Vehicle) and is fielded with the same two-man 25-mm Bushmaster Cannon turret with a coaxial M240C 7.62-mm machine gun. It only varies from the M2 in a few subtle ways and by role. The M3 is classified as an armored reconnaissance and scout vehicle and does away with the firing ports found in the M2 series. The M3 also carries more TOW missiles as well as more ammunition for its 25-mm and 7.62-mm guns. The Bradley family as a whole was originally intended to support the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC), but ended up replacing it in U.S. Army service altogether. Today, the Bradley is fielded in conjunction with the M1 Abrams series of main battle tanks and often accompanies infantry squads into combat. In the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Bradleys destroyed more enemy tanks than the M1 Abrams. Only three Bradleys were lost to enemy fire; however, at least 17 were lost to friendly fire. Improvements to the Bradley family have included enhanced identification features, as well as anti-tank missile countermeasures (for first generation wire-guided missiles only) and improved armor protection in the form of ERA. The United States and United Kingdom worked jointly on the Future Scout and Cavalry SystemTRACER in the 1990s. The U.S. Army's intended replacement for the M3 Bradley and up-armored Humvee reached the engineering and manufacturing development phase. It reached the engineering and manufacturing development phase before both partners terminated their involvement in October 2001 to pursue other more urgent programs: the U.S. Interim Armored Vehicle and the UK Future Rapid Effect System. From 2003 Future Combat Systems (FCS) planned a successor to the M3 Bradley in the XM1201 Reconnaissance and Surveillance Vehicle. That too was canceled when FCS was terminated in 2009. The U.S. Army intended the Ground Combat Vehicle to replace the M2 Bradley and M113 by 2018, while the M3 Bradley could later be replaced by future variants of the GCV. The GCV project was cancelled in 2014. All versions are equipped with two four-barreled M257 Grenade Launchers on the front of the turret for creating defensive smoke screens, chaff, and flares. It is also fitted with an engine smoke-generating system. Armor for the hull and turret for all variants is steel, 5083 aluminum, and unique to the turret is 7039 aluminum. The M3A1 variant introduced a gas particulate filter system. The M3A1 variant introduced a fire suppression system. The Bradley is highly capable in cross-country open terrain, in accordance with one of the main design objectives of keeping pace with the M1 Abrams. Whereas the M113 would float without much preparation, the Bradley was initially designed to float by deploying a flotation curtain around the vehicle. This caused some drownings due to failures during its first trials. Armor upgrades have negated this capability. The M3 Bradley was originally developed to accommodate a scout motorcycle. The idea was abandoned when it became apparent that the cycle's unprotected fuel tank could be hazardous to crew members. This model is essentially a re-stowed M2 Bradley. The passenger compartment was occupied by two troopers and more ammunition and missiles. Because it did not carry a squad, the firing ports were covered. The M3 retained the three periscopes between the cargo hatch and entry ramp and the periscopes along the left side of the vehicle, while those on the right side were covered over as they would have been inaccessible due to the TOW missile stowage rack. The M3A1 variant introduced a gas particulate filter system for NBC threats. Unlike the M2A1 Bradley, the NBC masks were connected to the central filter for all five crewmen, instead of just the driver, gunner, and vehicle commander. This variant also introduced a fire suppression system. The three periscopes on the rear deck were omitted on the M3A1, and replaced by four periscopes in the cargo hatch itself. The M3A2 incorporated enhanced armor upgrades, such as the ability to mount explosive reactive armor, from the M2A2 Bradley. After live fire testing, seating and ammunition stowage arrangements were also changed, with the observers moved to a bench on the left side of the vehicle and the missile stowage rearranged to enhance safety. After the Gulf War, other improvements including an eye-safe carbon dioxide laser rangefinder, global positioning system and compass, missile countermeasure device, combat identification system, and thermal viewer for the driver were incorporated into the M3A2-ODS. The M3A3 model of the Bradley uses enhanced information and communication equipment, a central processing unit, and information displays for the vehicle commander and squad leader. The M3A3 is compatible with the inter-vehicular communication system of the M1A2 Abrams tank and AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopter. The commander has an independent thermal viewer and a new integrated sight unit called the Improved Bradley Acquisition System (IBAS), which allows automatic gun adjustments, automatic boresighting, and tracking of dual targets. The roof is reinforced with titanium armor. Many M3A3s were converted from M3A2s. The M3A4 model of the Bradley is fitted with a new 675 horsepower (503kW) engine. Electronic systems have been improved. Deliveries of upgraded vehicles commenced in 2020.",Normal

"The PT-91 Twardy (Polish pronunciation: , English: Hard) is a Polish main battle tank. A development of the T-72M1, it entered service in 1995. The PT-91 was designed at the OBRUM (Ośrodek Badawczo-Rozwojowy Urządzeń Mechanicznych, or Research and Development Centre for Mechanical Appliances) and is produced by the Bumar Łabędy company, part of the Bumar Group, a Polish technical military consortium. Changes from the T-72M include a new dual-axis stabilized fire-control system, reactive armour, a more powerful engine, transmission and new automatic loader. Unlike many other T-72 upgrades, Polish Army PT-91s feature elements created almost exclusively by domestic companies, including the new engine, fire control system, and all communication system elements. Many of the elements were used to upgrade existing fleets of T-72 tanks in countries including the Czech Republic (T-72M4 CZ), Georgia (T-72SIM-1), and India (T-72 Ajeya Mk. 2). A total of 232 PT-91 tanks were delivered to the Polish Land Forces: 92 newly built vehicles and 140 from refurbished T-72A and T-72M1 tanks, designated PT-91M1 and PT-91MA1, respectively. In the late 1980s, the Polish Army modernized all of its obsolete T-55 tanks to the T-55AM Mérida standard. The successful conversion convinced the General Staff that similar modernization programs could be applied to other Soviet-designed tanks made in Poland and used by the Polish Armed Forces. In late 1988, the decision was made to prepare the modernization of the T-72M1, using experience gained from the production of licensed T-72M (obiekt 172M-E3 – Polish army designation T-72), T-72M1 (obiekt 172M-E5) and T-72M1K (Polish army designation T-72M1D). The Gliwice-based OBRUM was chosen as the main design bureau. However, initially, the work progressed at a very slow pace, mainly because the Polish General Staff was also considering the purchase of a newer version of the T-72 (T-72S) or the modern T-80. After the political upheaval of 1989 and dissolution of the Soviet bloc, Polish-Soviet talks on purchase of modern tanks came to a halt and support for designing a new Polish tank gained momentum. The first design proposed by the bureau was code-named Wilk (Polish for wolf), but the project was cancelled. Instead, priority was shifted to a different project named Twardy. The basic aim of the T-72 conversion was to adapt it to the reality of modern warfare and fix its most visible deficiencies. Among those were low mobility, insufficient armour, lack of a fire control system and poor stabilisation of the main gun, which resulted in poor firing accuracy. An additional problem was the lack of passive night vision aiming systems. Starting in July 1991, T-72 modernization programs were implemented by the Bumar-Labedy factory, which had been producing T-72s under Soviet license. The modernized main battle tank was designated the PT-91 Twardy. Bumar-Labedy enhanced the tank's armour protection, fire control system and the engine. In 1993, the Polish Defense Ministry ordered 20 PT-91 tanks, to be used for field trials and armed forces tests. The new ERAWA dynamic armour, developed by the Poland Military-Technical Institute, increased the main battle tank's protection from high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) projectiles and missiles. The protection consisted of 394 tiles with explosives, which would detonate in case of a direct hit. The tiles cover 9m2 of the tank: 108 are placed on the turret, 118 on the hull and 84 on each side's anti-HEAT screens. The Twardy uses steel anti-HEAT screens instead of the rubber one used on the T-72. The ERAWA tiles fit together almost without gaps, unlike the gaps on the modernized Soviet T-72 which measure up to 15mm, noticeably decreasing their defensive effectiveness. There are two ERAWA modifications: ERAWA-1 and -2, differing in weight of the explosives. Experiments showed that the ERAWA dynamic defense decreases the high-explosive jet impact depth by 50–70% and that of penetrator (APFSDS) projectiles by 30–40%. Furthermore, ERAWA's explosive containers do not detonate when hit by a shot of up to 30mm calibre or by shell or mine fragments, or when covered in burning napalm or petrol. The Twardy is armed with the same 2A46 125mm smoothbore gun used in the T-72, fitted with an automatic reloading mechanism which reduces the tank crew by one, as it replaces the gun loader, and gives a rate of fire of 8 to 10 rounds per minute. Additional armament comprises the 7.62mm PKT coaxial general-purpose machine gun and 12.7mm NSVT anti-aircraft heavy machine gun. The PT-91 has a thermosmoke device that generates smoke screens from fuel, and has 24 grenade launchers fitted with smoke, anti-personnel fragmentation, or tear gas grenades developed specifically to provide a non-lethal protection. The modernization of the fire control system began with replacing the older Soviet 2Є28M two-plane stabilizer with a new stabilizer developed in Slovakia. The system has an electronic information block showing the tank's technical condition. Furthermore, it informs the commander when the sighted fire becomes ineffective from excessively high cross-country speed or other reasons. The Drawa (uzbrojenie) fire control system, developed by Polish engineers, contains the PCD gunner's day sight and the TES thermovision night sight developed by the Israeli company El-Op, the POD-72 commander's combined day-night passive observation and aiming sight, a ballistic computer, a laser rangefinder, and a data system processing information for the ballistic computer. The sighting of the ballistic computer depends on the target's speed, weather conditions, projectile temperature, and projectile type. The driver uses the US-DK-1 control and diagnostic complex to control the tank's main systems, displaying information on a monitor. The driver's night sight was replaced by the Radomka passive night sight. The modernized tank's increased weight led the developers to add a more powerful engine: a 12-cylinder S-12U diesel engine (a modernized version of the Soviet V-46-6) produced in Warsaw by PZL-Wola, generating 850hp instead of 780. The main improvement is the modernized fuel and air injection system. This caused, however, a noticeable decrease in the tank's road endurance. The latest Twardy variants have the 1,000hp S-1000 engine with a turbocharger. Production variant for the Polish Army, an extensively modernized development of the T-72M1. Most are equipped with an SKO-1M Drawa-1T dual-axis stabilized fire control system (with TES – Thermal Elbow Sight; the total number of delivered thermal sights is 202) though some early production vehicles have a SKO-1 Drawa (with NV sight), Erawa reactive armour, a PCO SSC-1 Obra-1 laser-warning system and 850hp PZL-Wola S-12U engine. The first 20 initial production vehicles were delivered to Polish Land Forces in 1993–1994. Another 78 full-scale production vehicles were delivered 1995–1997, 135 modernized T-72M1 tanks (made in the late 80s) were delivered between 1998 and 2002. Both new and modernized tanks have the same combat capabilities. The Polish Army uses PT-91s in 3 variants– PT-91, PT-91M and the PT-91MA1. Development variant with a PZL-Wola S-1000 1,000hp engine with mechanic transmission and a number of other minor changes. Used for trials and as a demonstrator on military exhibitions. (Z for Zmodernizowany – literally Modernized) Further development with a SAGEM Savan-15 fire control system. In live-fire tests the Savan-15 has a minor advantage in accuracy over the Drawa. The biggest advantage is a new gun stabilization system that provides a significant increase in accuracy when the tank is on the move. Later it was used as a base to develop the PT-91M. This variant has won a number of stress tests in Malaysia over the T-90, T-84 and K1 tanks, and has won the competition for a new Malaysian MBT. Only one prototype was made. (M for Malaysia) Production export variant for Malaysia with a Sagem Savan-15 fire control system, a new 1,000hp powerpack, and a Renk automatic transmission, bringing its top speed to 70kmh. Its main gun has been changed to a ZTS 2A46MS 125mm gun, along with a 7.62mm FN MAG coaxial machine gun and a 12.7mm FN Browning M2 HB AA machine gun. This variant is equipped with a Sagem panoramic sight, a Sagem laser gyro inertial navigation system, turret stabilisation system, Obra-3 laser-warning system, and is integrated with 81mm smoke grenade launchers, CBRN warning and protection system, and Thales communication system. It also features ERAWA 2 Explosive Reactive Armour, and German-made tank tracks (Diehl Defence). Two prototypes were made (renamed PT-91E and PT-91Ex), then 48 serial PT-91M Pendekar vehicles were produced from 2007 to 2009. (E for Export) Renamed prototypes of the PT-91M used as demonstrators of the export variant shown at military exhibitions. The PT-91E is an initial prototype, initially named SP1 (it is the same vehicle that was shown on military parade in Kuala Lumpur in 2005). PT-91Ex is the second prototype, named SP2. Both vehicles faced a number of tests in Malaysia. SP1 was used for traction tests and was driven 7000km offroad in Malaysia. SP2 achieved 2000km with 500 firings of the main cannon. The PT-91Ex is very similar to PT-91M, and is offered for export to other countries. (P for Peru) A demonstrator for the SITDEF Peru 2009 military exhibition, the PT-91P is a cheaper alternative to the PT-91Ex. This variant is equipped with the latest PCO Drawa-TG fire control system, a thermal sight, and a modern communication system (Radmor RRC9310 radio, WB Electronics Fonet-IP communication system and Teldat battlefield management system). The vehicle was shown at a number of South American events including the SITDEF Peru 2009 Expo. (U for Urbanizowany – Tank to fight in urbanized terrain) A demonstrator for the MSPO 2011 military exhibition. This is an offer for the Polish Army which involves certain modifications of the T-72 and PT-91 tanks. The modification includes installation of such additional equipment as a remote-controlled cannon with an optical system, an omnidirectional observation system, add-on armour, and further engineering equipment. The PT-72U is equipped with a remote-controlled weapon station armed with a 12.7mm machine gun mounted to the crew commander hatch. The system had a fire rotation of 360° and an elevation angle for the gun from -5° to 55°. The observation system is equipped with 8 day–night cameras with the observation angle 55° and a rotary passive camera FLIR which has up to 26 times optical zoom. The armour package has chassis and turret bar armour. The bottom of the chassis is equipped with reactive armour and add-on armour. The PT-72U is equipped with a full range of new modern internal and external communication tools, allowing communication also via the internet. There were plans to modernize 84 Armenian T-72s to the PT-72U standard. A further development introduced in 2016. Upgrades include improved armour, armament, and mobility. The hull armour and cast turret have been upgraded with add-on composite armour equivalent to up to 1000mm RHA (rolled homogeneous armour), supplied by Germany. The protection can be improved with Polish ERAWA explosive reactive armour. The 125mm smoothbore cannon has been replaced with a 120mm smoothbore cannon compatible with NATO ammunition and uses a carousel-type autoloader. This autoloader is separate from the crew compartment, where the T-72 autoloader was located. The manned 12.7mm machine gun has been upgraded to be remotely operated. Other improvements include an upgraded fire control system. The tank is proposed to be fitted with a new engine, options for which include an unspecified Serbian turbocharged diesel, a German 1088hp, Serbian V46-TK, and potentially yet-to-be-developed 1200hp engines. Other improvements include rubber skirts covering the lower hull and the tracks, and new tracks based on those found on German Leopard 2s, which can be fitted with deep wading kits to allow it to ford water obstacles up to 13 feet (4.0 meters) deep. The upgrade can be applied to both PT-91s and T-72M1s, of which Poland has a total of 823 (233 PT-91s, 120 active T-72M1s, and 470 reserve T-72M1s). The vehicle did not enter mass production. The main goals of the PT-17 tank were to increase firepower and fire maneuverability, increase mobility and survivability on the battlefield, improve crew comfort, and increase mission duration. The demonstrator was developed in cooperation with Ukrainian companies that supplied the tank turret. The PT-17's power range includes a S1000R ESM-350M engine and a reinforced suspension. Diehl rubber tracks are used. The chassis equipment includes an auxiliary power generator (APU), air conditioning, a new steering system with shuttlecock and a PCO KDN-1 Nyks daynight reversing camera. The tank turret is a Ukrainian construction, featuring the Ukrainian KBM-2 smoothbore 120mm cannon, with a barrel length of L50, and a 22mm ammunition-charge unit mounted in the niche of the turret. The total ammunition capacity is 50 shells. The armament is supplemented by a 7.62mm caliber machine gun and a remotely mounted ZSMU-1276 armament module manufactured by Zakłady Mechaniczne ""Tarnów"" S.A. The turret was equipped with stabilized sight-and-sight optics, GOC-1 Nike and GOD-1 Iris from PCO S.A. and BMS. Optionally, the manufacturer advises on the use of Safran's VIGY-15 panoramic day-observation device. The additional composite armour of both the hull and the turret is expected to increase survival of the tank on the battlefield, as is the installed PCO SSP-1 OBRA-3 universal self-propelled vehicle system and two 6-tube intermittent grenade launchers. Features installed on the demonstrator systems are just an example of the possibilities. Ultimately, they can be configured according to the needs of the potential recipient. Although the PT-91M2's modernization objectives are the same as the PT-17's, the range of the PT-91M2 differs considerably. The S-12U engine is powered by an 850-horsepower engine with enhanced mechanical transmission (Cx version). Tracks come with rubber overlays developed by Obrum Bumar. Like the PT-17, reinforced suspension (torsion shafts, shock absorbers, and elastomer bumpers) are used. Among the chassis, equipment included the auxiliary power generator (APU), the modernized rotary car charger, the PNK-72 ""Radomka"" night-vision, and PCO KDN-1 Nyks night-time reversing camera. Hull protection is provided by the ERAWA III reactive armour and rod armour at the rear of the chassis. Increased firepower is planned to be achieved by installing a 125mm 2M46MS caliber Slovak cannon with a barrel length of 48 calibres. Inside the turret, there is also a change to the location of the second round of ammunition. Significantly, the PT-91M2 demonstrated a SAVAN-15 French fire control system (SAVAN-15) from Safran, previously used in PT-91M tanks in Malaysia. A TKN-3z night vision mount is available for the commander. The PT-91M2 has a SOD Observation System, a universal PCO SSP-1 OBRA-3 vehicle self-propelled system (both PCO S.A.), and two modules each of 12 902A smoke grenades. Additional protection for the turret includes ERAWA reactive armour modules. WZT is the acronym of for Wóz Zabezpieczenia Technicznego literally Technical Support Vehicle: it indicates a family of armoured recovery vehicles based on the PT-91T-72 tank hull, with over 400 vehicles delivered to the clients. It is armed with a 12.7mm (1⁄2 in) machine-gun fitted to the commander's hatch. Standard equipment includes: crane with telescopic jib that can lift a maximum load of fifteen tonnes, front-mounted stabilizing dozer blade, main and secondary winches. (MID for Maszyna Inżynieryjno-Drogowa – lit. Engineering-Roading Machine; Bizon is Polish for Bison) – Polish engineering tank based on the PT-91 tank hull. (PMC for Pomocniczy Most Czołgowy – lit. Auxiliary Tank Bridge) – Polish Armoured Vehicle Launched Bridge is a close-support bridgelayer. The PMC-90, developed on the basis of PT-91, is able to carry out missions required to operations of combat forces. The PZA (Przeciwlotniczy Zestaw Artyleryjski, meaning ""AA Artillery System""; “Loara” means “Loire” in Polish) is an armoured self-propelled anti-aircraft artillery system developed in the late 1990s. Based around the Twardy chassis, this system mounts an armoured turret holding two Oerlikon KDA 35mm cannons linked to a radar fire control system. It was planned that it would work closely together with PZR “Loara” (anti-aircraft rocket system) vehicles built on the basis of the PZA Loara but that project is currently on hold. The Loara is an autonomous fire unit capable of performing its tasks independently or acting as a component of a wider air defense system. The system has two radars, 3D search radar and engagement radar. The search radar has a range of 26km (16mi) and is capable of tracking and identifying up to 64 targets at once. The radar system can be operated on the move, refreshing its data every second. The system has a laser range-finder, TV and FLIR cameras giving the system both all-weather daynight capabilities and the ability to operate entirely passively in a heavy ECM environment. The system has a reaction time less than 10 seconds. The system can engage aircraft flying at altitudes from very low altitudes up to 5,000m (16,000ft), and flying at speeds up to 500ms (1,125mph). It is effective against infantry, lightly armoured ground and naval targets. SJ-09 is one of the elements of the T-72 and PT-91 crew training system. The system is composed of both trainers teaching crew trainees how to operate different systems of the tank and simulators allowing training more advanced situations. For example, the SJ-02 is used to teach how to load the main gun. The SJ-09 is the driver training vehicle used to train drivers in operating of the vehicle as big and heavy as main battle tank. The vehicle is a tank chassis that has the turret replaced with an instructor station. All unnecessary equipment (like side skirts) were removed. The vehicle has a dummy main gun that obstructs the driver's view, like in the real tank. Vehicles used by the Polish Army were rebuilt from the few original T-72 Ural in Polish inventory delivered from Soviet Union. Another vehicle was built new for the Malaysian Army as a part of the PT-91M order. (Goryl is Polish for Gorilla) – project of a Polish main battle tank designed using experience gained on PT-91 project. The tank would be similar in its design to Merkava (engine at front), and it would feature redesigned engine, transmission and fire control system. Armour: composite + ERA, main armament: 120125mm gun, 60mm mortar, secondary armament: 7.62mm PKT coaxial machine gun, 12.7mm NSWT AA machine gun, crew: 3. This program was also known under the name Anders. The program was cancelled at an early stage. The Gepard (Polish for Cheetah), sometimes known as PT-2001, is another modification project of a Polish main battle tank prepared as a future modernisation programme for the T-72 family. The programme was called for, after the first PT-91 proposition fell below requirements. Two propositions were submitted, one by Bumar which provided a project with modified frontal armour, different mortar and sporting a Leclerc–like a turret with the 2A46 main gun. OBRUM's competing project had new front and sides reactive armour and a L-44 main gun. Despite considerable improvements, neither was approved for financial reasons, and no prototypes were built. However, design experience helped with new PT-91 versions. The Krab (Polish for Crab) is a 155mm self-propelled howitzer designed by HSW S.A. with an OBRUM's UPG-NG chassis (a heavily modified variant of the SPG-1M vehicle) which utilizes only a handful of components from the PT-91 program such as the road wheels, suspension and S-12U power plant. It combines these with a licensed AS-90M Braveheart turret armed with a 52-calibre gun and WB Electronics Artillery Fire Control System Topaz. In 2014, this configuration was abandoned due to manufacturing flaws (microfractures detected in the vehicle's welded steel plates), numerous reliability concerns related to the automotive performance of the chassis and the loss of the Polish manufacturing line for the S-12U engine, and was replaced by the Korean-made K9 tracked chassis. 233 PT-91s were delivered between 1995 and 2002. 232 vehicles remain in service. An early prototype is preserved in the Land Forces Training Center museum in Poznań. 38 support vehicles were based on the T-72PT-91 hull (29 WZT-3M armoured recovery vehicles, 8 MID engineering tanks, and one prototype PZA Loara self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon). Units equipped with the PT-91 Twardy: Former units equipped with PT-91 Twardy: At the introduction of PT-91, the intention of Polish General Staff was to equip all brigades of the 11th Armoured Cavalry Division with the PT-91. At the time, the division had four brigades: the 10th Armoured Cavalry, 15th Armoured Cavalry, 17th Mechanised, and 34th Armoured Cavalry. In 2002, the 10th Armoured Cavalry brigade received Leopard 2A4 tanks donated to Poland by Germany. In 2007, the 15th Armoured Cavalry brigade was disbanded and the 17th Mechanised received the first KTO Rosomak. All these changes allowed the reallocation of PT-91s to other divisions, replacing the oldest T-72s. In early 2014, the 34th Brigade from Żagań received the first Leopard 2A5 tanks, shifting its PT-91s to the 9th Brigade in Braniewo, which previously used the T-72M1. A typical Polish PT-91 tank battalion is equipped with 58 tanks, composed of four frontline companies with 14 vehicles each, and 2 tanks for the battalion commander and the battalion second in command. Every company of 14 tanks is composed of three platoons, with 4 tanks in each and 2 tanks for the company commander and company's second in command. Before the start of the war in Ukraine, Polish Land Forces operated 4 battalions of PT-91 tanks. 3 battalions in 16th Mechanized Division (2 in 9th Armored Cav brigade, 1 in 15th Mechanized Brigade) and one battalion in 12th Mechanized Division (2nd Mechanized Brigade). Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Poland transferred most combat ready T-72s and at least one battalion of PT-91 to Ukraine. 2nd Mechanized Brigade lost its PT-91 tanks in one tank battalion completely, 34th Armored Cavalry lost all (combat ready) T-72s from its two battalions with no replacement. 19th Mechanized Brigade also lost all T-72s from two battalions but received some PT-91s from 9th Armored Cavalry and 15th Mechanized (making all 3 units understrength). 20th Mechanized Brigade is another unit that lost all its T-72s from its one tank battalion, but already received first K2 Black Panther tanks (two companies as of late 2023), it will have two battalions of K2,including one newly formed. It is planned that 16th Mechanized Division (with 9th Armored Cavalry, 15th and 20th Mechanized Brigades) will be equipped with K2 tanks (during transition a mix of K2 and PT-91). 18th Mechanized Division (with 1st Armored, 19th and 21st Mechanized Brigades) is receiving M1 Abrams tanks that will replace Leopard 2 and remains of T-72. It is expected 11th Armored Cavalry Division (with 10th and 34 Armored Cavalry and 17th Mechanized Brigades) will continue to operate Leopard 2 tanks that undergo upgrade to Leopard 2 PL variant (in 10th Brigade) and will receive more Leopard 2 tanks from 18th Division that will be replaced by M1 Abrams (for 34th Brigade). In 2007–2009, Bumar Łabędy delivered to Malaysia 48 PT-91M and 15 support vehicles (6 WZT-4 {WZT-91M} armoured recovery vehicle, 3 MID-M {MID-91M} engineering tank, 5 PMC Leguan {PMC-91M} - armoured vehicle-launched bridge and one SJ-09 driver training tank), ammo, spares and support for US$370 million. Operating capability was reached 1 September 2010. Units equipped with PT-91M: Rejimen ke-11 KAD is the sole user of PT-91M in the Malaysian Army. Upgraded Georgian army T-72SIM-1 tanks use the Drawa-T fire control system, a development of the fire control system on the PT-91. The FCS is equipped with laser range finder and thermal imaging sensor. The system is slightly different from the one used on Polish PT-91s: the commander uses an LCD screen instead of an eyepiece. The Thermal Elbow Sight thermal imaging sensor used in Georgian tanks is of the same (Israeli) origin as the one used on the PT-91, though the external housing is different. In April 1999, India ordered 44 WZT-3 armoured recovery vehicles, followed by orders in April 2002 (80 vehicles) and July 2005 (228 vehicles) for a total of 352 WZT-3s. These vehicles are used to support the T-72 and T-90 main battle tanks. Deliveries began in 2001, and India was planning to upgrade its Ajeya Mk1 tanks (local name for T-72M1) to Ajeya Mk2 standard, with some elements from PT-91, such as the Drawa-TE1 fire control system and the PZL-Wola S-1000 engine. In October 2011, the Indian Defense Ministry announced that the state-owned BEML would produce an additional 204 WZT-3 armoured recovery vehicles – taking the total to 556 vehicles. The Ministry also clarified that no global tender was floated because it was a repeat order. In April 2023, at least 30 PT-91's were sent to Ukraine by Poland for support in the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive. The tanks are used by 22nd Mechanized Brigade, new brigade of Ukrainian Land Forces trained and equipped by Poland.  On July 9, 2023, a single PT-91 was destroyed along the Zaporizhzhia direction; this was the first loss recorded in combat. A second PT-91 was destroyed in August.

"Mario Virgilio Álvarez Dugan (9 April 1931 – 13 December 2008) was a Dominican editor and journalist who served as the head editor of Hoy, a newspaper published in his hometown of Santo Domingo, from 1988 until his death in 2008. Álvarez Dugan began his career as a sports commentator and announcer. He became the general editor of Deportes in 1958. Additionally, he founded and managed two now defunct Dominican equestrian magazines, Handicap and El Enllave. Álvarez Dugan joined the staff of the El Caribe in 1966, later serving as the newspaper's chief editor during the 1970s. He also worked within the management of the El Nacional, but left that particular paper in 1988 to become editor of Hoy. He remained editor of Hoy until his death in 2008. He was inducted into the Dominican sports hall of fame in 1993. Álvarez Dugan authored several sports related books on administrative corruption in athletics, sports anecdotes and the history of baseball in the Dominican Republic. Álvarez Dugan died at a hospital in Santo Domingo, just days after he was admitted suffering from heart problems. He was 77 years old.

"State Trunk Highway 188 State Trunk Highway188 (often called Highway188, STH-188 or WIS188) is a 11.88-mile (19.12km) state highway in Dane and Columbia counties in south–central Wisconsin, United States, that runs north–south from near Sauk City to near Merrimac. WIS188 starts in rural Dane County across the Wisconsin River from Sauk City. The highway runs northward through farm fields on the east side of the river, crosses into Columbia County, and heads to an intersection with WIS60 east of Prairie du Sac. The two highways run concurrently to the northeast for about 1.5 miles (2.4km) before WIS188 separates and turns northward again. Near Lake Wisconsin, the highway turns east and then back north before sticking to an eastward course along a bend in the river. At the intersection with WIS113 near the Merrimac Ferry, WIS188 terminates. Around 1942, the routing of WIS78 was shifted to the east side of the Wisconsin River between Sauk City and the Merrimac Ferry. later, in 1947, that highway was moved back to its previous routing, and the highway on the east side of the river was rechristened WIS188.

"The Dog and the Sheep is one of Aesop’s Fables and is numbered 478 in the Perry Index. Originally its subject was the consequence of bearing false witness. However, longer treatments of the story during the Middle Ages change the focus to deal with perversions of justice by the powerful at the expense of the poor. It has sometimes been alternatively titled The Wolf, the Dog and the Sheep in order to distinguish it from the fable of the dispute between the sheep and the dog that guards them (Perry 356). The fable as originally told by Phaedrus records the fate reserved to liars. A dog took a sheep to law over a loaf that he claimed to have given it and was supported by a wolf called as witness. Though the sheep lost the case, it later came across the wolf dead in a ditch and drew the moral that this was as a result of heavenly punishment. After the social breakdown of the Middle Ages, the fable's focus changed to misuse of justice and the fate of the poor in the many Latin versions recording it. Walter of England's fable is much grimmer. The dog is supported in his accusation by three false witnesses, the kite, vulture and wolf, and the sheep has to cover the cost by selling its wool in mid-winter. Nor does any heavenly punishment follow. The moral is simply that this is the way of the world: (""Often laziness begs faith in false witness, often justice is the captive of criminal deceit""). Indeed, in the slightly later French version of Marie de France, it is the lamb that dies of cold. This had always been the intention of its carnivorous false accusers, the wolf, the kite and the dog, who then divide its body between them. Marie de France's poem comprises 42 octosyllabic lines, of which the last eight provide a commentary on how law has been corrupted by the powerful to oppress the poor. During the course of the 15th century two more authors used the fable to comment at even greater length on this social abuse still needing redress. The poems were the work of the Chaucerian poets John Lydgate and Robert Henryson, both of whom composed short collections of Aesop's fables, using decasyllabic rhyme royal. Lydgate's The Tale of the Hownde and the Shepe, groundyd agen perjuré and false wytnes comprises 32 of these seven-line stanzas, of which some sixteen are devoted to a denunciation of perjury and greed. The story itself is told with satirical intent, with its introduction of the false witnesses as ""The faithful wolf, in trowth that doth delite, And with hym comyth the gentil foule, the kyte"". As in Marie de France, the sheep perishes and is divided between its accusers. Henryson had trained in law and many of the 25 stanzas of his Taill of the Scheip and the Doig are devoted to a description of the legal process in the Scotland of his day. Here the wolf plays the part of judge, the raven is the summoner, while the kite and the vulture are lawyers. The unrepresented sheep is browbeaten into forfeiting its wool to compensate the dog but survives to utter his complaint to Heaven: The fable continued to be related in the Renaissance as an exemplary story even after reforms in the law. Hieronymus Osius devoted a short Neo-Latin poem to it in which the sheep is dunned for ""certain measures of wheat"", as Roger L'Estrange termed it in his own prose version of 1692. John Ogilby and Samuel Croxall returned to the more violent ending in their versions, where the dog tears the sheep to pieces at the end of the legal process to divide between his confederates. Besides offering the usual conclusions in his 'application', Croxall - with the long struggle against Stuart misrule in mind - goes on to comment that ""it is hard to determine which resemble Brutes most, they in acting or the People in suffering them to act their vile, selfish Schemes."" The Russian fabulist Ivan Krylov made substantial changes to the original version of Phaedrus in his fable of ""The Peasant and the Sheep"". In particular he adapted the story to satirise his own time and country and, like Henryson before him, put particular emphasis on detailing legal language and process. In this case a peasant takes a sheep to court, accusing it of having eaten two of his fowls. The judge is a fox (or a wolf in the earlier version), who refuses to believe the sheep's plea that it is not an eater of such delicious fare. The sheep is therefore condemned to death; its flesh is reserved for the court's use and its pelt is awarded to the peasant. In a time of strict censorship, Krylov did not bother to draw a moral; the manifest absurdity of the proceedings makes its own point. The poem was later set as a song by Alexander Gretchaninov among his ""Fables After Ivan Krylov"".",Normal

"""Blank Space"" is a song by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift and the second single from her fifth studio album, 1989. Swift wrote the song with its producers, Max Martin and Shellback. Inspired by the media scrutiny on Swift's love life that affected her girl-next-door reputation, ""Blank Space"" portrays a flirtatious woman with multiple romantic attachments. It is an electropop track with a minimal arrangement consisting of synthesizers, hip hop-influenced beats, and layered vocals. Big Machine in partnership with Republic Records released ""Blank Space"" to US radio on November 10, 2014. One of the best-selling singles of 2015, it topped charts in Australia, Canada, Iceland, Scotland, and South Africa. In the United States, it spent seven weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Music critics praised the production and Swift's songwriting; some picked it as 1989's highlight. The song earned three nominations at the 58th Grammy Awards, including two general categories: Record of the Year and Song of the Year. Rolling Stone placed it at number 357 on their 2021 revision of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Joseph Kahn directed the music video for ""Blank Space"", which depicts Swift as a jealous woman who acts erratically when she suspects her boyfriend's infidelity. The video won Best Pop Video and Best Female Video at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards. Swift included ""Blank Space"" in the set lists for three of her world tours: the 1989 World Tour (2015), Reputation Stadium Tour (2018), and the Eras Tour (2023). Rock musicians such as I Prevail and Ryan Adams adapted ""Blank Space"" into cover versions of different genres. Following the 2019 dispute regarding the ownership of Swift's back catalog, she re-recorded the song as ""Blank Space (Taylor's Version)"" for her 2023 re-recorded album 1989 (Taylor's Version). Inspired by 1980s synth-pop with synthesizers, drum pads, and overlapped vocals, Taylor Swift abandoned the country stylings of her previous releases to incorporate a pop production for her fifth studio album, 1989, which was released in 2014. Swift began writing songs for the album in mid-2013 concurrently with the start of Swift's headlining world tour in support of her fourth studio album Red. On 1989, Swift and the Swedish producer Max Martin served as executive producers. Martin and his frequent collaborator Shellback produced seven out of 13 songs on the album's standard edition. Having been known as ""America's Sweetheart"" thanks to her wholesome and down-to-earth girl next door image, Swift saw her reputation blemished due to her history of romantic relationships with a series of high-profile celebrities. The New York Times asserted in 2013 that her ""dating history  begun to stir what feels like the beginning of a backlash"", questioning whether Swift was in the midst of a quarter-life crisis. The Tampa Bay Times observed that until the release of 1989, Swift's love life had become a fixed tabloid interest and overshadowed her musicianship. Swift disliked the media portrayal of her as a ""serial-dater"", feeling that it undermined her professional works, and became reticent to discuss her personal life in public. The tabloid scrutiny on her image prompted her to write satirical songs about her perceived image, in addition to her traditional romantic themes. Talking to GQ in 2015, Swift said that she envisioned ""Blank Space"" to be a satirical self-referential nod to the media perception of her image as ""a girl who's crazy but seductive but glamorous but nuts but manipulative"". She admitted that she had felt personally attacked for a long time before realizing ""it was kind of hilarious"". She co-wrote the song with its producers, Max Martin and Shellback. ""Blank Space"" follows the verse–chorus song structure. The lyrics in the verses are clipped, ""Magic, madness, heaven, sin"", which the musicologist Nate Sloan said to set a mysterious and dreadful tone. At one point, Swift describes herself as a ""nightmare dressed like a daydream"". The refrain alludes to Swift's songwriting practice taking inspiration from her love life: the lyrics, ""Got a long list of ex-lovers They'll tell you I'm insane But I've got a blank space, baby"", are followed by a brief silence and then a clicking retractable pen sound, and Swift concludes the refrain, ""And I'll write your name."" After the song's release, the line ""Got a long list of ex-lovers"" was misheard by some audience as ""All the lonely Starbucks lovers"", which prompted internet discussions including a response from Starbucks themselves. Swift told NME in 2015 that when ""Blank Space"" was released, "" the people got the joke, half the people really think that was like really owning the fact that  a psychopath"". According to Sloan, the narrator of ""Blank Space"" is unreliable, and therefore it is open to interpretation whether the song is a true portrayal of Swift's character or not. In contemporary publications, journalists commented that the track represented 1989's lighthearted view on failed relationships and departed from the idealized romance on Swift's past albums. Others wrote that Swift made fun of her image and the media discourse surrounding her celebrity, which later served as the foundation for her sixth studio album Reputation (2017), an album exploring her public experiences and the media gossip. Martin and Shellback employed a sparse production for ""Blank Space"" as Swift wanted the song to emphasize the lyrics and vocals. Musically, ""Blank Space"" is an electropop song that is set over minimal hip hop-influenced beats. The song incorporates synthesizers, percussioned guitar strums, and layered backing vocals. In the refrain, Swift sings in her higher register and the production crescendos with faster programmed drums. Some contemporary critics compared the song's minimal production to the singer-songwriter Lorde's music, specifically her 2013 album Pure Heroine. Spin's Andrew Unterberger wrote that as with the rest of 1989, ""Blank Space"" embraces 1980s pop music authenticity while incorporating a modern twist. Baesley thought that the minimal production may ""sound bright and easy, but it's anything but the latter to create"", and he called it ""weapons-grade, professional pop"". Big Machine and Republic Records released ""Blank Space"" as the second single from 1989, after the lead single ""Shake It Off"". In the United States, the song impacted US rhythmic crossover radio on November 10, and hot adult contemporary and contemporary hit radio on November 11, 2014. Universal sent ""Blank Space"" to Italian radio on December 12, 2014, and released a CD single version of ""Blank Space"" in Germany on January 2, 2015. ""Blank Space"" debuted at number 18 on the US Billboard Hot 100 on the chart dated November 15, 2014. The single reached number one in its third week on the chart, supported by the release of its music video. It took the number-one position from 1989's lead single ""Shake It Off"", making Swift the first and to date, the only woman ever in Billboard Hot 100 chart history to succeed herself at the top spot. ""Blank Space"" remained atop the Billboard Hot 100 for seven consecutive weeks. As of July 2019, ""Blank Space"" has sold 4.6million copies in the United States. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the single 8× Platinum, which denotes eight million units based on sales and track-equivalent on-demand streams. On the Hot 100 chart dated August 19, 2023, ""Blank Space"" re-entered at number 49, after it gained in streams as Swift had been performing it on the Eras Tour. It rose to number 46 the following week. The single also reached number one in Australia, Canada, South Africa, and Scotland. It peaked atop the Euro Digital Song Sales, a Billboard component chart, and the Finnish Download Chart. ""Blank Space"" charted within the top five of national record charts, at number two in New Zealand, Poland, Slovakia, number three in Bulgaria, number four in the Czech Republic, Ireland, Israel, the United Kingdom, and number five in Lebanon. It received multi-platinum certifications in Australia (13× Platinum), Canada (4× Platinum), New Zealand (4× Platinum), and the UK (2× Platinum). According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), the song was the eighth-best-selling song of 2015, with 9.2million track-equivalent units. The song received widespread acclaim. Upon the release of 1989, Shane Kimberline of musicOMH called ""Blank Space"" one of the album's best songs. PopMatters's Corey Baesley lauded it as ""easily a candidate for the best pop song of 2014"". Sydney Gore from The 405 deemed ""Blank Space"" the album's highlight, and Aimee Cliff from Fact labeled it one of Swift's ""most enjoyable songs to date"" for portraying Swift's love life in a larger-than-life manner. Drowned in Sound's Robert Leedham wrote that Swift succeeded in experimenting with new musical styles on 1989, specifically choosing ""Blank Space"" as an example. The Observer critic Kitty Empire picked ""Blank Space"" as a song that showcased Swift's musical and lyrical maturity, calling it ""an out-and-out pop song with an intriguingly skeletal undercarriage"". Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood selected the track as one of the album's better songs because of Swift's songwriting craftsmanship. The New York Times critic Jon Caramanica deemed the song ""Swift at her peak"" that ""serves to assert both her power and her primness"". The Independent's Andy Gill was less enthusiastic, calling it a ""corporate rebel clichéd "" song. Retrospective reviews of ""Blank Space"" have been positive. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian in 2019 declared ""Blank Space"" the best single Swift had released, praising its success in transforming Swift's image from a country singer-songwriter to a pop star thanks to its ""effortless"" melody and witty lyrics. Rolling Stone reviewer Rob Sheffield wrote: ""Every second of 'Blank Space' is perfect."" Paste in 2020 described the song as ""remarkably well-made, infectiously catchy, and legitimately funny"", and named it the best song on 1989. Selja Rankin from Entertainment Weekly also dubbed ""Blank Space"" the best track on the album, praising the over-the-top lyrics and its catchy 1980s pop sound. The Recording Academy in 2023 picked ""Blank Space"" as one of Swift's 13 essential songs that represented her songwriting and musicianship. Rolling Stone ranked ""Blank Space"" sixth on their list of the best songs of 2014, 73rd on their list of the best songs of the 2010s decade, and 357th on their 2021 revision of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Time named it as the ninth best song in their year-end list. The song placed at number three on The Village Voice's annual year-end Pazz & Jop critics' poll of 2014. Stereogum and Uproxx ranked the song at numbers 49 and 72 on their lists of the best songs of the 2010s decade, respectively. Billboard named it one of the 100 ""Songs That Defined the Decade"". Katie Atkinson wrote that the single consolidated Swift's trademark autobiographical storytelling in music while ""setting the standard for a new, self-aware pop star"" in poking fun at her perceived image. On Slant Magazine's list of the 100 best singles of the 2010s, ""Blank Space"" ranked 15th. ""Blank Space"" won Song of the Year at the 2015 American Music Awards. At the 2016 BMI Awards, the song was one of the Award-Winning Songs that helped Swift earn the honor Songwriter of the Year. It earned a nomination for International Work of the Year at the 2015 APRA Awards in Australia. At the 58th Annual Grammy Awards in 2016, ""Blank Space"" was nominated in three categories—Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Solo Performance. Joseph Kahn directed the music video for ""Blank Space"". Swift approached Kahn with the idea for treatment, desiring the video to portray her self-deprecation as a ""crazy villain"" akin to the lyrics. According to Kahn, Swift envisioned ""Blank Space"" as ""a video addressing this concept of, if she has so many boys breaking up with her maybe the problem isn't the boy, maybe the problem is her"". Photography took place at two locations in Long Island: primary shooting took place at Oheka Castle, with a few additional scenes shot at Woolworth Estate. The video was shot over three days in September 2014. The last day was dedicated to film American Express Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, an interactive 360° mobile app in collaboration with American Express. For the video, Swift was thorough in choosing the concepts and imagery. Kahn spoke of his working experience with Swift on Mashable: ""When you have an artist wanting to test her imaging, it's always great territory to be in."" Kahn took inspirations from Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film A Clockwork Orange for the video's symmetrical framing style, calling it ""a really funny way to approach a pop video"". The video begins as Swift's love interest, played by model Sean O'Pry, drives a Shelby AC Cobra towards Swift's mansion. Upon arrival, he and Swift quickly become a loving couple. They engage in various romantic activities together, dancing, painting a portrait for the boyfriend, walking along the estate grounds, and riding horses into the woods. Halfway through the video, Swift notices him texting someone, and the couple begins to fall apart. They begin to fight, and Swift shows erratic behaviors such as throwing vases, slashing the painted portrait, and burning her boyfriend's clothes, which drives him to end the relationship. At a high point, Swift uses a golf club to destroy her boyfriend's car, a reference to Tiger Woods' 2009 cheating scandal. As the boyfriend leaves the estate, a new man, played by Andrea Denver, approaches, offering Swift a new hope for love. Swift planned to premiere to the video on Good Morning America on November 11, 2014, but Yahoo! accidentally leaked it a day before. Swift posted the video onto her Vevo account quickly after the leak. The interactive app American Express Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, featuring the 360° video version of ""Blank Space"", was released concurrently. The user can choose to either follow Swift and her love interest throughout the linear storyline, or leave the storyline to explore other rooms in the mansion and find interactive easter eggs, such as Swift's childhood photos. The app was available for free on mobile app stores. Kahn talked to Rolling Stone that the app was created with ""superfans"" who wanted to ""feel even closer to Swift"" in mind. Upon release, media outlets compared the narrative of the video to that of Gone Girl, in the sense that both Swift and Gone Girl's protagonist "" away the romantic sheen she's given all her relationships in the past"". Randall Roberts from the Los Angeles Times wrote that Swift delivered an ""Oscar-worthy"" performance. Billboard praised the video's cinematic quality and aesthetics, and found Swift's self-referential portrayal amusing, which served as ""icing on the blood-filled cake"". The Guardian columnist Jessica Valenti complimented Swift's portrayal of her perceived image and dubbed the video ""a feminist daydream"", where ""the narrow and sexist caricatures attached to women are acted out for our amusement, their full ridiculousness on display"". USA Today in 2017 named the video Swift's best music video and called it a ""pure 'art' form"". Spin also dubbed it the greatest video Swift had done so far, praising the video's combination of glamorous aesthetics and hilarious depiction of Swift's reputation. Entertainment Weekly in 2020 picked ""Blank Space"" as the best video among 1989 singles, describing it as ""the only music video that can be earnestly described as 'Kubrickian'"". It won Best Pop Video and Best Female Video at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards and earned a nomination for Best International Female Video at the MTV Video Music Awards Japan. The American Express Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience app won Original Interactive Program at the 67th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. Rolling Stone placed ""Blank Space"" at number 67 on its list of 100 greatest music videos of all time. Swift performed ""Blank Space"" during the ""1989 Secret Session"", live streamed by Yahoo! and iHeartRadio on October 27, 2014. Swift premiered the song on television at the 2014 American Music Awards, where she recreated the narrative of the music video, acting as a psychopathic woman who acts erratically towards her boyfriend. She again performed the song on The Voice on November 25, at the 2014 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show on December 2, and during Capital FM's Jingle Bell Ball 2014 in London, broadcast on December 5. On February 25, 2015, Swift opened the 2015 Brit Awards with a rendition of ""Blank Space"". At the beginning of the performance, Swift sang the song in front of a white background featuring silhouettes of backup dancers. The song was part of the set lists for three of Swift's concert tours—the 1989 World Tour (2015), Reputation Stadium Tour (2018), and the Eras Tour (2023). On September 9, 2019, Swift performed the song at the City of Lover one-off concert in Paris, France. She performed the song again at the We Can Survive charity concert on October 19, 2019, in Los Angeles. At the 2019 American Music Awards, where Swift was honored Artist of the Decade, she performed ""Blank Space"" as part of a medley of her hits. She again performed the song at Capital FM's Jingle Bell Ball 2019 in London, and at iHeartRadio Z100's Jingle Ball 2019 in New York City. Following the song's debut at the 2014 American Music Awards, the rapper Pitbull uploaded a remix featuring his rap verse to SoundCloud on December 15, 2014. The retro music group Postmodern Jukebox transformed the song into a 1940s-inspired track in their cover, and the rock band Imagine Dragons performed a slowed down rendition of the song sampling Ben E. King's ""Stand by Me"" at BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge in February 2015. I Prevail, another rock band, released a post-hardcore cover of ""Blank Space"" as their debut single in December 2014. The cover reached number nine on Billboard Hot Rock Songs and number 90 on the Billboard Hot 100, and received a platinum certification by the RIAA, which denotes one million track-equivalent units. The rock singer Ryan Adams covered ""Blank Space"" on his 2015 track-by-track cover album of Swift's 1989. On his rendition, Adams incorporated stripped-down, acoustic string instruments, contrasting the original's electronic production. The indie singer Father John Misty released a cover version of the song in the style of the rock band the Velvet Underground in 2015. The cover is a reinterpretation of Adams's version and is built on the melody of the song ""I'm Waiting for the Man"".

After signing a new contract with Republic Records in 2018, Swift began re-recording her first six studio albums in November 2020. The decision followed a public 2019 dispute between Swift and the music executive Scooter Braun, who acquired Big Machine Records, including the masters of Swift's albums which the label had released. By re-recording the albums, Swift had full ownership of the new masters, which enabled her to control the licensing of her songs for commercial use and therefore substituted the Big Machine–owned masters. The re-recording of ""Blank Space"", subtitled ""Taylor's Version"", was released as part of 1989's re-recording, 1989 (Taylor's Version), on October 27, 2023. Swift produced ""Blank Space (Taylor's Version)"" with Christopher Rowe, who had produced her previous re-recordings. The track was engineered by Derek Garten at Prime Recording Studio in Nashville, Tennessee; mixed by Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia; and mastered by Randy Merrill at Sterling Sound in Edgewater, New Jersey. Rowe and Sam Holland recorded Swift's vocals at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles and Kitty Committee Studio in New York. Music critics had different opinions on the re-recording's production. The Line of Best Fit journalist Kelsey Barnes commented that ""Blank Space (Taylor's Version)"" sounded like an ""exact replica"", but The Independent's Adam White wrote that the re-recorded song features Swift's matured vocals that eroded the ""raw mania"" of the original song. In NME, Hollie Geraghty praised the re-recording for showcasing one of the album's ""deliciously polished belters that still feel brand new nearly a decade later"". ""Blank Space (Taylor's Version)"" peaked at number nine on the Billboard Global 200 chart. On national singles charts, the re-recorded song peaked within the top 20 in Australia (9), Canada (11), New Zealand (12), and the United States (12). Credits are adapted from the liner notes of 1989 (Taylor's Version).",Normal

"Keanu (also known as Cat Boys) is a 2016 American buddy action comedy film directed by Peter Atencio and written by Jordan Peele and Alex Rubens. The film stars Peele and Keegan-Michael Key in their first film as lead actors following five seasons of their sketch TV series; it also features Tiffany Haddish, Method Man, Nia Long, Will Forte, and Keanu Reeves. The plot follows two cousins who infiltrate a gang in order to retrieve their stolen kitten. Filming began in New Orleans in June 2015. The film premiered at the South by Southwest Festival on March 13, 2016 and was theatrically released in North America on April 29, 2016. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $20 million against its $15 million budget. Assassins named the ""Allentown Brothers"" enter a Mexican cartel's drug-processing facility and kill everyone, including the boss, King Diaz. They try to take Diaz's kitten, Iglesias, but the kitten escapes. Recently dumped Rell finds the kitten on his doorstep and names it Keanu. Two weeks later, Rell and his cousin Clarence come home from seeing a movie to find Rell’s place ransacked and Keanu missing. Rell's weed dealer Hulka tells them the ""17th St. Blips"" gang may have raided Rell's looking for his cat. Hulka sends them to a strip club, where they meet Hi-C, a female gangster, and the gang's leader Cheddar, who mistakes them for the Allentown Boys. Cheddar says he will return the kitten if they act as expert advisors for the Blips on a run to sell a new drug called ""Holy Shit"". After the sale run, they are abducted by the real Allentown Boys. Rell and Clarence are tied to chairs and the Allentown Boys prepare to torture them. Keanu frees Rell and Clarence, and they grab their guns. As the Allentown boys approach them, Clarence and Rell unload the guns into them. On their way out, searching for Keanu, they run into the Blips and Cheddar forces them to come along to meet with the Mexican drug cartel the next morning. There, the Blips meet King Diaz's cousin, Bacon Diaz, offering Clarence and Rell, ‘The Allentown Boys.’ When Bacon also demands ""Iglesias"", Cheddar refuses and a gunfight erupts between the two gangs. Clarence and Rell shoot their way out of the mansion pursuing Bacon, who has Keanu, only for Rell to be shot in the leg and Clarence shot in the hand. Rell, who never learned to drive, hijacks Bacon's escape car with Bacon and Keanu in the back. Clarence chases them. It ends at Clarence's front yard where Rell crashes, sending Bacon flying through the broken windshield. Bacon gets up and attempts to shoot Rell, but Clarence runs him over. Again, Bacon gets up, but is shot dead by Cheddar and the Blips. Hi-C reveals herself as an undercover police officer. She forces the Blips to drop their guns and shoots Cheddar. The police arrive. Hi-C promises to testify for leniency and agrees to go on a date with Rell after they get out of jail. Six months later, Rell and Clarence have three weeks left on their jail sentences. They are respected by the inmates, including the Blips, for killing the Allentown Boys. Hi-C brings Keanu, telling Rell through a visitation phone that Keanu has a rare disease which will cause him to stay a kitten forever. In a post credit scene, it is revealed that the Allentown Boys, despite suffering multiple gunshot wounds, somehow survived and drive off into the night. The film was officially announced by New Line Cinema in October 2014, with Peter Atencio directing. Many sites reporting on the film had initially believed it to be a parody of the then recently released John Wick, but according to Atencio the two films were developed independently of each other, and the team was initially unaware of Wick until work on Keanu was already underway. Keanu Reeves himself, who starred in Wick, was eventually in touch with the production, leading a dream sequence in the film to be modified with Reeves providing the voice of the titular kitten. Reeves originally turned down the cameo offer but changed his mind after his sister showed him the film's trailers. In May 2015, Method Man and Will Forte joined the cast, with Darrell Britt-Gibson being added the following month. Filming began on June 1, 2015, in New Orleans, Louisiana, and concluded on July 10. Seven tabby kittens were used for the shoot. They were trained for three weeks by use of treats, meat flavored baby food and laser pointers, and when not on camera, were allowed to be played with by cast and crew during breaks. Treats were also used to train them to allow themselves to be dressed in lightweight costumes without attempting to remove them. All seven were adopted by the end of production, with Haddish adopting one and naming it 'Catatonic'. Since Key is allergic to cats, he had to take a medication in order to interact with them. Clarence was always meant to be a fan of a White musician, with the writers settling on George Michael as pre-production started. Key added that dancing to his music had him ""summon everything I ever did at every school dance from 1985 to 1990"". The producers then reached for Michael's managers stating that the musician would not be treated as a joke but ""so cool that even drug lords got a tattoo of him"", meeting his approval. A work-in-progress print was screened at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas on March 13, 2016. Warner Bros. originally scheduled the film for release on April 22, 2016, but in January 2016 the film was moved back a week to April 29, 2016. In the United States and Canada, Keanu opened alongside Mother's Day and Ratchet & Clank, and was projected to gross $10–14 million from 2,658 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $3.5 million on its first day, including $560,000 from Thursday night previews. The film went on to gross $9.5 million over the weekend, finishing third at the box office, behind The Jungle Book ($43.7 million) and The Huntsman: Winter's War ($9.6 million). In its second weekend, the film grossed $3.3 million (a drop of 65.2%), finishing 5th, behind Captain America: Civil War ($179.1 million), The Jungle Book ($24.5 million), Mother's Day ($11.1 million) and The Huntsman: Winter's War ($3.9 million). On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 78% based on 182 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4010. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Keanu's absurd premise and compulsively watchable starring duo add up to an agreeably fast-paced comedy that hits more than enough targets to make up for the misses."" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B"" on an A+ to F scale. In a March 2017 AMA on Reddit, Jordan Peele stated that ""if we do a Keanu 2, I promise you we will do twice as many deaths as there are in John Wick 2.""",Normal
"The House of Gogoski family, or House of Gogovci is a house in the village of Vevčani, Vevčani Municipality, North Macedonia. The house belongs to the Gogoski family and the building is registered as a Cultural Heritage of North Macedonia. The house was built in 1887. In the following decades, the house was expanded by the influential Vevčani native merchant Kuzman Gogov. In the period 1928–1932, Gogov was mayor of Vevčani and with his organizational skills he contributed a lot to the development of the village by building a hospital, paving the streets, building the Belo Džade (lit. White Road), as well as road to the Ascension of Christ Church. The building has a distinctive architecture, including the existing old house. It consists of a first (ground) floor and a second floor, and is a house with a double-oriented central veranda. Both floors to the northeast are built of stone with leveled wooden beams. Part of the ground floor was an open porch, and the rest contained business premises. The mezzanine and roof construction were made of chestnut wood. The stairs that connected the ground floor and the second floor, as well as all the doors and floors are also made of chestnut wood. The second floor is sticks out with a bay window to the southeast and contains a light wooden structure filled with whole bricks. Above the wooden windows there is a brick ornament. The south-eastern and north-western facades, which have a half-enclosed stone loggia with whole bricks, which extends over the street and the courtyard, stood out in particular.

"Hlöd or Hlod was the illegitimate son of Heidrek, the king of the Geats, in Norse mythology. He appears in the Hervarar saga and probably also as Hlith in Widsith, line 115, together with his father Heiðrekr (Heathoric), half-brother Angantyr (Incgentheow), and his mother Sifka (Sifeca). Hlöd had grown up with his grandfather Humli, the king of the Huns, and he was both handsome and valiant. As soon as he was born he was given weapons and horses, as was the custom of the time. When Hlöd heard that his father Heidrek was dead and that his half-brother Angantyr had been proclaimed king of the Goths, his grandfather Humli said that Hlod had to go to Arheimar and demand his rightful inheritance. Hlöd arrived to Arheimar with many Hunnish warriors. He found a man outside of the hall and asked him to go inside and tell Angantyr that his brother wished to see him. When King Angantyr learnt of who was waiting outside for him, he cast down his knife, took his mailcoat, his white shield in one hand and Tyrfing in the other. Then he asked Hlöd to come in and drink with them in honour of their dead father. However, Hlöd answered that he had not come to feast, he wanted half of everything that Angantyr had inherited from their father: cow and calf, handmills, tools and weapons, treasures, slaves, bondmaids, sons and daughters, Myrkviðr, the grave, the carved stone beside Dniepr, Heidrek's armour, lands, liegemen and rings. Angantyr refused to share with Hlöd and said that he had no right to inherit, but in recompense Hlöd would get lances, wealth, cattle, a thousand thralls, a thousand horses and a thousand armoured bondsmen. Before leaving all of them would receive riches and a maid. Hlöd would get his measure in silver and gold, and he would be given a whole third of the land of the Goths to rule. However, Gizur Grytingalidi, the aged king of the Geats, who was visiting in order to bid farewell to his dead foster-son Heidrek, thought that Angantyr was too generous. Gizur stated that Hlöd was only a bastard and the son of a slave-girl, and should not receive so princely a gift. Offended by being called a bastard and a slave-girl's son, Hlöd returned to the Huns and to Humli. He told Humli that Angantyr had refused to share the kingdom with him, and when Humli insisted he also said that he had been called the son of a slave. Humli decided that they muster all the might of the Huns and attack the Goths. As soon as spring arrived they gathered an army so vast, that the steppes were depleted of men of fighting age. Every man who could carry arms down to twelve-year-olds, and every horse from two years of age and older. All in all the Huns mustered a horde of 343,200 mounted warriors. When the horde was gathered they rode through Myrkviðr which separated Reidgotaland from the land of the Huns. As the horde came out of the forest they arrived at a populous country of flat plains. On the plains there was a fortress with a strong garrison commanded by Hervor, the sister of Angantyr and Hlöd, together with Ormar, her foster-father. One morning as the sun was rising above the steppes, Hervor stood on a watchtower and saw a great cloudstorm rising southwards over the forest. It hid the sun for a long time. Suddenly, she saw under the cloud a mass of gold. There were gilded helmets, shields and corselets and she realized that it was the horde which had arrived. Hervor asked the trumpeter to blow a summons to gather the forces. Then she told Ormar to ride and meet the Huns and challenge them to do battle in front of the southern gate. Ormar rode to the Goths and told them that they would do battle outside the southern gate. Outside that gate, there was a mighty battle, and since the horde was much larger, the Goths fell and finally Hervor was slain. When Ormar saw her die he retreated together with all those who were faint of heart. He rode day and night to reach king Angantyr in Arheimar. As the Huns pillaged and burnt far and wide in Reidgotaland, Ormar arrived at Arheimar and related that the marches were burning at the hands of the Huns and that his sister was dead. Angantyr's lips were drawn back and said that his brother had not treated Hervor like a sister, and then he watched his small company and stated that the more men one needs the less one has. Gizur, the aged King of the Geats, said that he would fight for Angantyr and he would ask for no recompense. Heidrek had instated a law that if an army invaded a land and the king of that country marked a field with hazel poles, the marauding army would stop pillaging until there had been battle inside the poles. The old Gizur armed himself with good weapons and leapt on his horse like a young man. Then he asked where Angantyr desired to meet the Huns. Angantyr answered that he wished to meet them on the plains of the Danube below the Hills of Ash, where the Goths had oft been victorious. Gizur rode so close to the Huns that they could hear him and shouted that Odin was angry with them and that they were doomed. Hlod cried that they should seize Gizur, but Humli said that lone heralds must not be hurt. Gizur called out that the Goths were afraid of neither the Huns nor their bows, and then he hastened to Angantyr to report about the size of the horde. Angantyr sent messengers to every part of the land to summon every able-bodied man. He then marched to the Danube with his great army and met the great army of the Huns. They fought for eight days. No one could count the fallen but still no captains had been slain. Day and night the armies clashed around Angantyr, and the fight grew more and more bitter. The Huns became more and more ferocious as they knew that they would not survive a defeat. The Goths, on the other hand, were fighting for their freedom and for the land where they were born. When the eighth day ended, the Goths pushed forward breaking the Hunnic lines. The Huns lost their courage as they saw Angantyr ride through the lines slashing and cutting men and horses with Tyrfing. Angantyr and Hlod met and Hlod fell, as well as Humli. The Huns fled but the Goths pursued them and filled the rivers with bodies so that they choked and this caused a flood which filled the valleys with dead men and horses. Angantyr searched among the slain and finally found his brother. He stated that cruel is the doom of the Norns when brother slays brother.",Normal
"Cynthia Jane Fellowes, Baroness Fellowes (née Spencer; born 11 February 1957), is one of the two older sisters of Diana, Princess of Wales, the other being Lady Sarah McCorquodale. Lady Fellowes is the second daughter of Edward John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer (1924–1992), and the Hon. Frances Ruth Burke Roche (1936–2004). Her parents married in 1954 but divorced in 1969. She has always used her middle name of Jane (just as her elder sister also uses one of her middle names). One of Jane's godparents is Prince Edward, Duke of Kent. She was a bridesmaid at his 1961 wedding to Katharine Worsley. Like her sisters, Lady Fellowes was educated at West Heath boarding school near Sevenoaks in Kent. Sources say she was an excellent student, achieving the status of school Prefect and passing a good number of A-level exams. To paraphrase Andrew Morton, Lady Fellowes acquired a ""hatful"" of O-level and A-level exams. On 20 April 1978, Jane married her distant relation Robert Fellowes (b. 1941), then assistant private secretary to the Queen. During the ceremony at Westminster Abbey, Jane's sister Diana was a bridesmaid. On 12 July 1999, Robert Fellowes was granted a life peerage as Baron Fellowes, of Shotesham in the County of Norfolk, after first being knighted as Sir Robert Fellowes. Lord and Lady Fellowes have three children and five grandchildren: These children are maternal first cousins of Prince William and Prince Harry and also paternal second cousins of Sarah, Duchess of York. Laura is godmother to Prince William's daughter, Princess Charlotte. After Diana's death, conflicting views about the two sisters' relationship were voiced. Diana's butler Paul Burrell stated that the relationship was strained because of Lord Fellowes's position as secretary to the Queen, and that by the time of Diana's death they had not spoken in a number of years. On the other hand, Diana's childhood nanny, Mary Clarke, author of memoirs about her experience raising Diana, stated that the relations between Lady Fellowes and Diana were not as bitter as Burrell and others have said or assumed. It is not clear when their relationship deteriorated (if it did), but the sisters were neighbours on the Kensington Palace estate, with Diana living at numbers 8 and 9, and Lady Fellowes living at a house called the Old Barracks. Lady Fellowes and her sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale flew to Paris with their former brother-in-law Prince Charles to escort the Princess's body back for the public funeral. Witnesses reported that Lady Fellowes was very upset and needed to be assisted into a chair after seeing Diana's body at the hospital in Paris. Lady Sarah and Lady Fellowes played a part in the public funeral ceremony. Since Diana's death, Lord and Lady Fellowes have led a largely private life, along with their three children. Lady Fellowes attended the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton on 29 April 2011. She also attended the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on 19 May 2018, at which she delivered a reading.",Normal

Predominantly used as a rugby league ground, it is the home ground of the Tweed Heads Seagulls, who play in the Queensland Cup. The ground is also used by the club's junior rugby league teams. In December 1985, the Tweed Heads Seagulls purchased 40 acres of land in Piggabeen to build a playing field and grandstand, which would eventually become the Piggabeen Sporting Complex. By 1986, the construction of the complex was well underway. In 2003, the Seagulls gained entry into the Queensland Cup, becoming the first New South Wales-based team to enter the competition.

"Side by Side by Sondheim is a musical revue featuring the songs of Broadway and film composer Stephen Sondheim. Its title is derived from the song ""Side by Side by Side"" from Company. The musical had its origins when David Kernan was asked by Cleo Laine and her husband John Dankworth to put together a revue as a benefit for The Stables, a theatre they owned in Wavendon. Kernan contacted director Ned Sherrin and suggested that they do a revue of Sondheim material. Producer Cameron Mackintosh saw the benefit revue, which featured Millicent Martin, Julia McKenzie, Kernan, and Sherrin as the narrator, and agreed to produce it. In the TV documentary Cameron Mackintosh: The Music Man, Mackintosh admits that he never saw the benefit performance, but Christopher Biggins did, and Mackintosh went on Biggins' recommendation. The musical is in the form of a revue, with various sections tied together by being from a particular Sondheim musical, or having a common theme, and all of it is tied together by the Narrator. He explains what show the songs are from, and in some cases provides background on why a song was written. He also notes comparing and contrasting Sondheim themes for the audience. As the cast enters, they sing ""Comedy Tonight"", and then ""Love Is in the Air""; the Narrator explains that the latter song was the original opener for A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, but was dropped in favor of the more explicit lyrics of ""Comedy Tonight"". The Narrator notes that a theme that Sondheim has explored in many of his works is marriage, which introduces the next set of songs. Next are the unknown songs, one cut and one from a television program (""I Remember""). The medley from Company follows, and Act 1 closes with Follies, with the Narrator pointing out the different musical styles Sondheim has used in these songs, such as Vaudeville (""Buddy's Blues""). The female trio sing ""You Could Drive a Person Crazy"" as the act ends. Songs included have varied from production to production; the following is the song list from the original Broadway production The revue had its première on May 4, 1976, at London's Mermaid Theatre, where it ran for 59 performances. It subsequently transferred to Wyndham's Theatre, and then the Garrick for a total of 806 performances. Ned Sherrin directed, but Sondheim also worked with the cast and made many suggestions. Millicent Martin, Julia McKenzie, David Kernan, and Sherrin comprised the original cast. Hal Prince produced the Broadway version, and persuaded Actors' Equity Association to allow the original British cast to transfer with the show. The production, again directed by Sherrin, opened on April 18, 1977, at the Music Box Theatre, and later transferred to the now-demolished Morosco Theatre. Between the two venues, it ran for 384 performances and six previews. It is one of the few shows to have the distinction of its entire cast being nominated for Tony Awards (Best Featured Actor in a Musical and Best Featured Actress in a Musical). A subsequent 1978 U. S. national tour starred Martin, Larry Kert, Barbara Heuman, and Hermione Gingold as the Narrator. The Australian production opened 21 September 1977 at Canberra Theatre, and subsequently toured to Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. The cast included Jill Perryman, Geraldene Morrow, and Bartholomew John, with Noel Ferrier was the Narrator. John Laws was featured as the Narrator for the Sydney season, as well as on the cast album. The Australian cast recording was released by RCA in 1978. A revised production produced by John Edward Thomas (Little Women and Lizzie the Musical) and directed by Rob Marshall made its debut September 29, 1989, at Playhouse Square's State Theatre in Cleveland, Ohio. The cast featured Paige O'Hara, Marsha Waterbury, and Kurt Peterson, with music direction by Brad Garside. A London West End revival opened at the Venue Theatre on May 1, 2007, and closed June 23, 2007, after 62 performances and four previews. The cast included Abbie Osman, Alasdair Harvey, and Josie Walker, with rotating narrators. The musical was directed by Hannah Chissick, with musical staging by Adam Cooper.

"Peter Sinkamba (born 7 August , 1964) is a Zambian entrepreneur and politician. He was the candidate for the Green Party of Zambia in the 2015 and 2016 presidential election. Sinkamba became wealthy exporting maize to Zaire. Sinkamba founded Citizens for a Better Environment in 1997 due to the social and environmental risks of unregulated copper mining, particularly to the people living near mines. He helped fight for sustainable relocation of communities whose houses were affected by mining activities on the Copperbelt. This includes the relocation of Ming'omba and Kawama communities by Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) in Chililabombwe. This relocation was done between 2000 and 2003 and involved of over 100 houses.

The objectives of the fund are to ensure that mining companies have sufficient resources to implement their environmental management plans, and also to provide a guarantee to government not to use public funds in the event that the mining company fails to rehabilitate its site. When Anglo American Corporation pulled out Zambia in 2002, Sinkamba, through what he called the ""Copperbelt Manifesto"" rallied civil society groups across the globe to pressurize Anglo sustainably mitigate its environmental and social liabilities on the Copperbelt. This initiative led to Anglo setting up the Copperbelt Development Foundation and donating over 40% of shares in KCM to the foundation. He has also negotiated, on behalf of government, World Bank support to mitigate historical environmental and social issues on the Copperbelt as well as the lead poisoning problem in Kabwe. Between 2002 and 2017 the World Bank and other have committed in excess of $100 million to address historical environmental and social problems on the Copperbelt and Kabwe.

"Alfredo Guati Rojo Cárdenas (December 1, 1918 – June 10, 2003) was a 20th-century Mexican artist who worked to restore the reputation of watercolor painting as a true art form. His preference for the technique came from seeing Diego Rivera’s work and helping with a fresco mural in his hometown of Cuernavaca as a child. When he was 16, he went to Mexico City to study law, but switched to art. He learned the various classic art techniques but kept his preference for watercolor. His career began by teaching art, founding an art institute in the Colonia Roma section of Mexico City. In the 1950s, he tried to get the area's art galleries to show watercolors but they refused, considering it to be a minor art form. He began to host exhibitions of watercolor works at his art institute with success which led to the formation of the Museo Nacional de la Acuarela or National Watercolor Museum in the 1960s. The museum remained in Colonia Roma until the 1985 Mexico City earthquake destroyed the building and led to its relocation to the Coyoacán borough, where it remains. During this time, Guati Rojo also had a career showing and selling his own artwork, almost exclusively watercolors, in various parts of the world. Most of his income from this painting went to support the museum. Alfredo Guati Rojo Cárdenas was born on December 1, 1918, in Cuernavaca as the only child of María de Jesús Cárdenas and José Guati Rojo Ramírez. He spent his childhood listening to the stories of his paternal grandfather and traveling much of Mexico as his father was a criminal lawyer. He began drawing and painting images from his hometown of Cuernavaca when he was in primary school at about age seven. However he believed that it was seeing the murals of Diego Rivera on the wall of the Palace of Cortes that inspired him to be an artist. He had a primary school art teacher, Luis Betanzos, who recognized the boy's talent. Betanzos was also associated with Eduardo Solares of the Academy of San Carlos. When Solares came to Cuernavaca to paint a new fresco, Guati Rojo was selected to be an assistant. This gave him his first experience in water-based paint. At age 16, he left Cuernavaca for Mexico City to study at the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria, living at his grandfather's house. He then enrolled into law school as his father wanted to continue the family tradition. However, he soon decided that he did not like law and wanted to transfer to the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas . Despite strong opposition from his father, his mother was supportive and he made the switch. He progressed rapidly and began working at an assistant to his teachers. These earnings allowed him to buy watercolor supplies. Many of these early small paintings are part of the Museum's permanent collection. He graduated in 1940, and although trained in various techniques, he kept his preference for watercolor painting. That same year, he was awarded the “Águila Azteca” (Aztec Eagle) for his cultural work in Central and South America along with Ignacio Beteta . He also married Berta Pietrasanta, the sister of one of his art school classmates, Orlando Pietrasanta. The marriage lasted sixty four years, with her working with him on projects, most notably the running and promotion of the National Watercolor Museum after it was founded. They never had children, but the couple considered the museum as such. In 1995, they wrote a “Carta a mi hijo el Museo” (Letter to my child, the Museum) as testimony. Berta died in May 2003. This along with impending blindness due to disease made Guati Rojo depress and he died only a few weeks later on June 10, 2003. Guati Rojo's career began teaching art, starting from 1937 and teaching more or less full-time in various public and private schools until 1969. In 1954 he founded the Instituto de Arte de México in Colonia Roma. This institute offered shorter courses in the fine arts then traditional institutions and offered classes in ceramics, fashion design and jewelry making as well. The institute was located on the ground floor of the house he and his wife lived in. Here he gave classes and occasionally hosted cultural events. Guati Rojo was one of the first promoters of watercolors in Mexico. In the 1950s, he tried to get watercolors shown at galleries in Colonia Roma but could not because water color was considered only a “minor art.” So his Institute became the first place in Mexico City to exhibit watercolors as a serious art form. The shows at the institute began to have success and favorable reviews, leading watercolor artists in the city to sell their work. In 1955, part of the institute became the site of the first Salón Nacional de Acuarela (National Exhibition of Watercolors), an annual event which continues to the present. At first Guati Rojo was the judge of the works and bought many of the winning pieces. About a decade later, he founded the Sociedad Mexicana de Acuarelistas in 1964 along with Gustavo Alanís, Edgardo Coghlan, Manual Arrieta, Jesús Ochoa and Teresa Miranda. He remained the organization's president until his death in 2003. From the time he graduated from college, he had gathered a large collection of watercolors, starting with those of her former teachers and his past and present students. This collection became the base of Museo Nacional de la Acuarela or National Watercolor Museum, the first of its kind in the world in 1967. Guati Rojo and the Sociedad tried to get the government to fund a museum site but without luck. Guati Rojo founded another group, the Amigos del Museo de Acuarela (Friends of the Watercolor Museum) with the aim of operating the museum independently at the house in Colonia Roma, spending two years presenting shows and concerts to raise money. During this time, from the 1960s and 1970s, he also worked at the head of Diffusion Cultural of the Desarrollo Integral de la Familia agency and in 1971 he became the head of the Departamento de Artes Plásticos at the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. The watercolor museum continued to operate in the building in Colonia Roma until the 1985 Mexico City earthquake destroyed it. However, the loss of the building prompted the government to purchase the museum's current site at Salvador Novo 88 in the Coyoacán borough, an expensive section of the city. After this, the government said it would do no more. From 1985 until his death, he and his wife renovated the large house, with the gardens around the main house designed by the two, which includes a “poetic space” dedicated to the indigenous poet-king Nezahualcoyotl. In addition to its exhibition of its permanent collection and temporary shows, the museum arranges shows of Mexican watercolors all over the world. This has helped Mexican artists and given the institution renown. The museum is the first of its kind in the world, and is partly responsible for the re acceptance of watercolor as a serious art form. Guati Rojo founded the Bienal de la Acuarela (Watercolor Biennal) at the museum in 1992. His work founding the museum was accompanies by a long career of producing artworks, almost exclusively watercolors. His first exhibit was in 1947, and since then his work was shown individually and collectively in many countries of the world including Austria, Belgium, Spain, Italy, France, Great Britain, Japan, the United States, New Zealand, Indonesia, Brazil, Singapore, Colombia, Canada and Venezuela as well as in many parts of Mexico. His works are found in museum collections in many parts of the world, including the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in Israel, the Urawa-Saitama Museum in Japan, Boliviano de Arte Contemporáneo in Colombia, and Asociación Italiana de Acuarelistas de Milan in Italy as well as his National Watercolor Museum in Mexico. Near the end of his life, he was famous enough to sell painting just by announcing its start and not even showing it to the buyer. Much of the income from his own work went to supporting the museum. Shortly before his death, he lost most his sight. His last painting called Desde las sombras (From the shadows) (2003), was done while he was nearly blind. It was painted in as an abstract, printing in black using his hands. Over his career, Guati Rojo received recognition as a member of the Legión de Honor Nacional, the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana, the Royal Society of Arts of England, Agrupación de Acuarelistas de Cataluña, International Association of Fine Arts of UNESCO, Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour and the American Watercolor Society . He was considered one of the best watercolor artists and art promoters of Mexico in the 20th century. His main focus in life was to restore watercolor's reputation as a true art form. At the time, watercolor was relegated as a minor art, associated with old women, hobbyists and England of the 19th century. It fell out of favor in the 19th century with the advent of lithographic portraits and landscapes. Large oil paintings came to be seen as the only true art, with the small size of watercolor and their transparency thought of as insignificant. One of his defenses of the art is that fresco is really watercolor, over plaster instead of paper, using the fresco murals of Diego Rivera as examples. He also claimed that the British did not invent it as water based pigments have been used from prehistoric times. Guati Rojo also considered watercolor essential to Aztec civilization as the codices were written with water-based paints on amate paper. Unlike most watercolor artists, who paint on surfaces which are horizontal to keep the paint from running, Guati Rojo painted on vertical surfaces. He defied the effect of gravity by painting thin strokes also giving the images more exactness. He is quoted as saying ""Water, for me, has always had its mystery. Watercolors do what they want to do. You can´t change them for anything… No one can really say they have dominated the technique. Every time I start a new painting I am terrified that I will fail."" Although he did not do self-portraits, he included his likeness in some of his works. One of these is Salome (1984) where the face of John the Baptist is that to the artist with a beard. In another one of his works El Circo de la Vida (""The Circus of Life"") Guati Rojo paints a circus with three clowns in the foreground, aerialist and a man on a unicycle. The man on the unicycle is said to be Guati Rojo himself. Rojo painted himself into the work in order to show the viewer his participation in the ""Circus of Life"". The meaning of this work is to explain the act of creating theater in one's life in order to bring attention to certain subject. In the case of Guati Rojo, it was to bring attention to his museum and the art of watercolor. Guati Rojo tried to spark Mexican interest in the art of watercolor in the 20th century. Besides artist such as, Agapito Rincon Piña, Cristina Romero and Gral. Ignacio Beteta, who experimented with water color, most other artist experimented with other mediums.",Normal

"Yenice is a neighbourhood in the municipality and district of Tarsus, Mersin Province, Turkey. Its population is 8,433 (2022). Before the 2013 reorganisation, it was a town (belde). Yenice is in the extreme east of Mersin province, 15 kilometres (9.3mi) east of Tarsus, 43 kilometres (27mi) east of Mersin, and 25 kilometres (16mi) west of Adana. The Mediterranean coast is about 30 kilometres (19mi) to south. The village was established in 1543 during the Ottoman era by Oghuz Turks (Turkmens). The name of the town probably refers to a certain Yenice Bey who was a rebellious Turkmen chief lived in the first half of the 16th century. In the early years of the 19th century, the town was briefly occupied by the rebellious İbrahim Pasha of Egypt. After the First World War, Yenice was shortly occupied by France (cf. Sykes–Picot Agreement). After the Treaty of Ankara, 20 October 1921, Yenice was ceded to Turkey. On 30 January 1943, during the Second World War, the Adana Conference between the Turkish president İsmet İnönü and the British prime minister Winston Churchill was held in a railway carriage at Yenice Railway Station to discuss Turkey's role in the war. The carriage is now exhibited in the station. In 1953 Yenice was declared a township. The town is situated in the fertile Çukurova plain (ancient Cilicia). It is approximately at the midpoint between the Seyhan and Berdan rivers. The most important crop is cotton, followed by vegetables, citrus and wheat. There is also some light industry. Yenice is an important railway junction on the Adana–Mersin railway, connecting to the KonyaAnkara line to the north. It is on the Çukurova Motorway.

"The 1972–73 season was Paris Saint-Germain's 3rd season in existence. PSG played their home league games at the Stade Municipal Georges Lefèvre in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, registering an average attendance of 679 spectators per match. The club was presided by Henri Patrelle and the team was managed by Robert Vicot. Camille Choquier was the team captain. Bound by professional contracts with Paris FC, most of the club's players, including team captain Jean Djorkaeff and Bernard Guignedoux, continued playing in Division 1, while manager Pierre Phelipon departed following the expiration of his contract. Only Camille Choquier, Patrice Py, Jean-Louis Leonetti, Bernard Béréau and Jean-Louis Brost stayed with PSG in 1972–73. The club took the spot of its reserve team in Division 3 and rebuilt their squad with many upcoming players from the Paris Saint-Germain Academy. Led by new manager Robert Vicot, Paris Saint-Germain began life in the third tier with a young but talented squad that would star in the club's forthcoming back-to-back promotions. Some of these gifted youngsters included Éric Renaut, Othniel Dossevi, Michel Marella, Jacques Laposte and, most notably, Christian André, the main architect of the rise to Division 2 thanks to his 27 goals in 35 games. The Red and Blues finished second in Group West, six points behind Quevilly, missing out on promotion by little. Quevilly, however, had to dissolve due to financial problems shortly after the end of the season and PSG took their place in Division 2 by default.

"Ishtori Haparchi (1280–1355), also Estori Haparchi and Ashtori ha-Parhi (Hebrew: אשתורי הפרחי) is the pen name of the 14th-century Jewish physician, geographer, and traveller, Isaac HaKohen Ben Moses. HaParchi is commonly known by the title Kaftor va-Ferach taken from the name of his work, the expression being additionally a pun on his surname. Ish Tori, as he refers to himself in his book, may mean ""Man of Tours"", the capital of the medieval French county of Touraine, though according to other opinions ""Ishtori"" was simply his personal name, a single word. Ishtori Haparchi was born in Provence in 1280. Haparchi was descended from a line of sages and rabbis of fame. His father was Rabbi Moshe HaParhi, a distinguished Talmudical scholar. His grandfather was Rabbi Nathan of Trinquetaille, author of Shaar HiTefisa. His great-grandfather was Meir ben Isaac of Carcassonne, author of the Sefer ha-'Ezer. When the Jews were expelled from France in 1306, he travelled to Spain and Egypt, and then settled in Palestine under the Mamluk Sultanate. He worked as a physician in Bet She'an, where he died in 1355. In 1306, while in Barcelona, Ishtori Haparchi made a Hebrew translation of the Latin Tabula antidotarii of Armengaud Blaise. Ishtori Haparchi was the author of the first Hebrew book on the geography of the Land of Israel, Sefer Kaftor va-Ferach (Hebrew: ספר כפתור ופרח), literally ""Book of Bulb and Flower"", or ""Knob and Flower,"" written in 1322 in the Land of Israel and published in Venice in 1549. ""Knob and Flower"" is a Hebrew idiom meaning ""work of art,"" and is derived from the description of the menorah in Exodus 37:17. In the context of the book it refers to the agrarian laws practised by the nation of Israel. Haparchi lists the names of towns and villages in the Land of Israel and discusses the topography of the land based on first-hand visits to the sites. He describes its fruits and vegetables, and draws upon earlier rabbinic commentaries, such as the commentary compiled by Rabbi Isaac ben Melchizedek of Siponto. Modern scholarship relies heavily upon the 180 ancient sites he identified and described in relation to other sites, among them Usha, al-Midya and Battir.",Normal

"Thomas Wiliems (born in Ardda'r Mynaich in Arllechwedd, Wales possibly on 20 April 1545 or 1546; died in or before 13 August 1623) was a Welsh-language antiquarian. Wiliems's mother was Catherine, the illegitimate daughter of Meredydd ab Ifan of the Wynn family, and Wiliam ap Tomos ap Gronwy. Wiliems was brought up in the parish of Trefriw, Arllechwedd Isaf, Caernarfonshire, and is likely that Wiliems was educated in the Wynn family's own school (like William Morgan, who translated the Welsh Bible). The renaissance brought unprecedented interest in education to Wiliems's generation, and had a clear effect on his life. He attended Brasenose College, Oxford for a time, but clear records of his studies there are lacking because of confusion with other similarly named students, and it seems he did not take a degree. Rather he was ordained as an Anglican priest, serving as a curate for Trefriw from c. 1573. Accordingly, he was generally known to his contemporaries as Syr ('Sir') Thomas Wiliems, because this was the usual title for priests in Welsh at the time. However, Wiliems became a recusant, converting to Roman Catholicism, after which he worked as a physician (drawing on his extensive book-learning: qualifications as such were not required at the time). As a Catholic, Wiliems was denied access to printing, which perhaps helps to explain the focus of his scholarly activities on manuscript production. He died before August 13, 1623, at which time his uncle Sir John Wynn of the neighbouring Gwydir Castle, inscribed his name on the manuscript of Wiliem's dictionary as its owner. Notes in Wiliems's manuscripts suggest he turned to Catholicism; he was certainly charged on that score at Bangor in 1607. Wiliems is best known for producing a Latin-Welsh dictionary in manuscript form (National Library of Wales, Peniarth 228), apparently between 4 May 1604 and 2 October 1607. He worked towards this by keeping a kind of commonplace book (Peniarth MS 188), which he systematised by essentially taking the Dictionarium Linguae Latinae et Anglicanae (1587) by Thomas Thomas, the first printer of Cambridge University, and adding Welsh to it. This was completed in 1607 and entitled Thesaurus Linguæ Latinæ et Cambrobritannicæ or Trysawr yr iaith Laidin ar Gymraec, ne'r Geiriadur coheddocaf a'r wiriathaf o wir aleitiaith Vrytanæc, sef heniaith a chyphredin iaith yn y Brydain, ar Latin yn cyfateb pob gair. Wedy dechreu i scriuenu 4. Maij 1604. According to the prologue, Wiliems spent 30 years gathering material, and did so in order to promote the Welsh language, which was being spoken less and less by his contemporaries. The dictionary was not published during Wiliems's lifetime, despite the efforts of Wiliems's friend John Edwards (of Plas Newydd, Chirk), who got part way through making a neater manuscript copy (Brogyntyn MSS 9 and 10). Wiliems left the manuscript of the dictionary to Sir John Wynn, who passed it to John Davies of Mallwyd, asking that Davies publish it, giving recognition to the author and a dedication to Sir John himself. John was already undertaking a Welsh-Latin dictionary and in the event published an abbreviation of Wiliems's Latin-Welsh dictionary in the second part of his own, which emerged as Antiquae Linguae Britannicae ... Dictionarum Duplex in 1632. According to Bishop Humphrey Humphreys, Wiliems compiled ‘a pretty large Herbal in Latin, Welsh and English’. It is now lost, unless parts survive, copied by Thomas Evans, in Cardiff MS 2.973; but Wiliems certain consulted Llanstephan MS 10 and BL, Add. MS 14913 (containing Meddygon Myddfai). He seems to have translated the Trattato del sacramento della penitenza by Vincenzo Bruno SJ into Welsh, and compiled a collection of Welsh proverbs (surviving, in another's hand, in Mostyn MS 204). Wiliams's family connections meant that he knew the owners of some of Wales's most important medieval manuscripts, and he began transcribing manuscripts already by the age of twenty-one. His copying included: It is rumoured that Wiliems was involved in the Gunpowder plot and, in warning his relative John Wynn not to go to the State Opening of Parliament in 1605, was responsible to either a smaller or greater extent for the suspicions which ultimately caught Guy Fawkes. This story is the basis for a short historical novel written for children by Gweneth Lilly, entitled Treason at Trefriw (Gomer Press, 1993).",Normal
"Incremental rendering refers to a feature built into most modern Web browsers. Specifically, this refers to the browser's ability to display a partially downloaded Web page to the user while the browser awaits the remaining files from the server. The advantage to the user is a perceived improvement in responsiveness, both from the Web browser and from the web site. The purpose of incremental rendering is similar to the purpose of the interlaced JPEG, which improves the presentation speed to the user by quickly displaying a low-resolution version of an image which improves to a high-resolution, rather than an image that slowly paints from top to bottom. Without incremental rendering, a web browser must wait until the code for a page is fully loaded before it can present content to the user. Earlier web browsers offered something of a compromise - displaying the HTML page once the entire HTML file had been retrieved, and then inserting the images one-by-one as they were retrieved afterwards. Although the utility of incremental rendering seems intuitively obvious, making it happen is something of an art as well as a science. The sequence in which the various elements of a Web page render is almost never strictly top-to-bottom. The programming that fills in the missing pieces must do a certain amount of guesswork to determine how to best display partial content. Images in particular are virtually always loaded following the HTML page, as the browser must consult the HTML file in order to know which images to request from the server - as the server doesn't present them automatically without the follow-up request. Web designers and web design software often include hints that assist with this process - for example, including the expected heights and widths of images in the HTML code so the browser may allocate the correct amount of screen space before the image is actually retrieved from the server.

"Memorial Hall was initially built in 1883 to be used for events like commencement ceremonies and the first ever basketball games at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The architect, Samuel Sloan, designed the building to be larger than the previously used Gerrard Hall so that it could hold up to 4,000 people. Memorial Hall was created to honor the men at the university who fought in the Civil War and to commemorate some of the important antebellum figures at the University of North Carolina. Specifically David L. Swain was one of the men honored in the making of the building. Funding for Memorial Hall was initially provided by selling marble tablets that were dedicated to certain men who fell in battle during the Civil War. The tablets still exist and are kept on display at the current Memorial Hall. In 1929, the original building was determined to be unsafe, and it was therefore demolished while a new plan was set to construct a larger and sturdier auditorium. The second Memorial Hall was used for 70 years for purposes such as musical performances, lectures, cultural events, and more. At the turn of the millennium, however, a third plan was proposed by the university for a refurbishing of the auditorium to make room for the growing community in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The three-year plan began with the temporary closing of Memorial Hall in 2002. Construction started in May 2003 and the newly improved Memorial Hall was completed in August 2005. The present Memorial Hall includes updates such as air-conditioning, a stage twice the size of the 1930 building, and marble flooring that was mined from the same quarry that was used in the 1930 building. Funding for the third Memorial Hall totaled $17,981,080 coming from the Higher Education Bond Referendum, private donors, university funds, and the North Carolina General Assembly.

"Pontypool and New Inn railway station (Welsh: Pont-y Pwl & New Inn) is situated to the south east of Pontypool town centre between the town and the suburb of New Inn, Wales. The station was formerly called Pontypool Road until renamed just Pontypool in 1972 and then to the present name in 1994. It is part of the British railway system owned by Network Rail and is managed by Transport for Wales, who operate all trains serving it. It lies on the Welsh Marches Line from Newport to Crewe. For almost 100 years from the mid 19th century to the early 1960s, Pontypool Road was an important station and key railway junction connecting to the main line from Newport to the Midlands and north of England (via Hereford) and branch lines to Neath and Merthyr. At its height, Pontypool Road featured a 50-line marshalling yard, engine sheds, goods sheds and refuelling facilities. The burgeoning 18th-century iron industry in South Wales followed by the growth of coal mining industry in the 19th century required an extensive transport network. Initially canals were constructed such as the Brecon and Abergavenny Canal (opened 1812) which ran close to the southern part of Pontypool at Pontymoile. The rapid expansion of steam locomotion in the 1840s quickly saw the demise of the canals as the railways offered a faster and more economical transport system. With industry in the South Wales coalfield needing improved transport links the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company (MR&CC) opened the first line between Newport to Pontypool in 1852. The line initially terminated at Crane Street Station in Pontypool and was extended to Blaenavon in 1854. The Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway (NA&HR) opened a new station in January 1854 just south of the current station. The stationmaster's house and part of a platform are now a private residence. This line now allowed traffic from Hereford to join the MR&CC line at Panteg & Coed-y-Gric Junction and head south towards Newport and its docks. Sponsored by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), it opened on 6 December 1853. But in 1860 it merged with other railways to form the West Midland Railway which was in turn taken over by the Great Western Railway in 1863. Although initially named 'Newport Road', the station was by the end of 1854 called 'Pontypool Road' (the addition of Road within the station name is common in railway parlance when the station is situated away from the centre of the town served). The first stationmaster was Henry Griffiths after whom the nearby community of Griffithstown is named. The growth of the railways in the area saw the development of Sebastopol and Griffithstown to house workers. Pontypool Road was also the birthplace of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) in 1880. Further railways openings linked Pontypool Road to the Midlands and north of England. The Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway (NAHR) also opened the Taff Vale Extension Railway (TVE) in 1857 to link up with the Taff Vale Railway (TVR) at Quakers Yard which connected onto Merthyr Tydfil. A major achievement of this railway was the building of the Crumlin Viaduct over the Ebbw River. The TVE linked directly with the Vale of Neath Railway at Merthyr and further linked Pontypool to Swansea and Neath. The main purpose of this line was the transport of coal across the country. In September 1874 the Pontypool, Caerleon and Newport Railway (PC&NR) opened to goods traffic from Pontypool South Junction to Maindee Junction in Newport. By December 1874 the line was opened from Pontypool North Junction to Panteg Junction. Passenger trains also used the line and run to Newport High Street on the South Wales Railway over the St. Julian's railway bridge. By the late 19th century Pontypool Road contained a large rail network of junctions, sidings and sheds forming a large inverted triangle of tracks. Coed-y-Gric Junction of the Hereford line formed the southernmost point. Lines now split to go through Pontypool to the west and to the north via Hereford. Larger engine sheds and buildings were added. Additional sidings were added to cope with the increasing traffic and the marshalling of freight at Pontypool Road. By the early 20th century the original station at Pontypool was congested, and on 1 March 1909 a larger station was opened just north of it. It comprised a large island platform with two inset bays (one north to Monmouth, one south to join the TVE). A large station building was built with booking office and an underpass to reach the island platform. The new station now catered for the growing passenger numbers. Pontypool Road saw an increased activity during both wars. During the First World War, the Grand Fleet (based at Scapa Flow) had to be supplied with, on average, 100,000 tons of coal each week. The coal trains that maintained the supply were called Jellicoe Specials (named after Admiral Jellicoe) and most were marshalled at Pontypool Road before travelling to Grangemouth docks. The Second World War saw again a growth in trains but less coal as the Royal Navy was now generally oil powered. ROF Glascoed munitions and armaments factory was served by the Coleford, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway which branched from the mainline at Little Mill. Although a major junction, Pontypool was not the target of any German raids during the war. Pontypool had more centrally-located stations on branch lines, including Pontypool Blaendare Road, Pontypool Clarence Street and Pontypool Crane Street, but Pontypool Road was by far the biggest. Indeed, at its peak it was one of the busiest junctions in the country. As the railways went into decline in the 1950s the area was particularly badly hit by closures. The passenger service to Usk and Monmouth was withdrawn in 1955, the local branch line from Newport to Blaenavon was closed in April 1962 and in June 1964 the passenger service to Neath was withdrawn leaving Pontypool Road, as a main-line station, the only one remaining in the area. By the late 1970s the station was down to just 14 passenger trains a day on weekdays. Over the years the situation improved and by 2019 the station saw more than twice that number, but almost half of the passenger trains on the line go through without stopping. In 1972 it was renamed to simply Pontypool. The British Railways totem sign for Pontypool Road has been preserved in the nearby Torfaen Museum. The station underwent significant refurbishment in 1994. This involved the demolition of the last surviving major building (that housed the ticket office, offices for railway maintenance personnel and space for a local scout group). The station name was once again changed to the current geographically descriptive name at this time. The station has limited facilities due to its small size today and lack of great commuter use. There is a shelter that serves both sides of the island platform, digital CIS displays, a payphone and a customer help point. Tickets must be bought prior to travel using the ticket machine at the entrance, as the station is unmanned. There is no level access, as the only means of reaching the platform is via a staircase from the subway passing beneath the tracks en route tofrom the main entrance and car park on Station Road. In 2017, £500,000 refurbishment works were undertaken on the parking area outside the station. With a growth in commuters there was a need to increase the number parking bays. A consultation process was also undertaken to look into the option of opening a larger car park on the opposite side of the current one. The proposal was to utilise vacant scrub land and create a new larger car park that joined the A4042 dual carriageway that runs parallel to the station. As of September 2018 no decision has been made. On weekdays and Saturdays, there is generally a two hourly service between Holyhead and Cardiff in the middle of the day, with additional peak time services southbound in the mornings and northbound in the evenings for commuters to Newport and Cardiff. These include services between Manchester Piccadilly and West Wales via Crewe and Swansea. From December 2013 the evening northbound Arriva ""Premier"" service train began to call at Pontypool for the first time. The southbound service in the morning does not call here. On Sundays, an irregular service operates, with 8 trains calling southbound and 10 northbound. These mainly run between Manchester and Cardiff.

"Wąchock  ⓘ is a town in Starachowice County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, Poland, near Starachowice, within the historical region of Lesser Poland. In 2006, it had 2,777 inhabitants. Wachock received its town charter in 1454, lost it in 1869, and regained in 1994. Wąchock is first mentioned in historical records from 1179. In the 13th century, a Cistercian abbey was founded here, and today its buildings form the most notable sight in the town. The abbey emerged as one of the richest institutions of this kind. Monks from Wąchock contributed to the development of early industry along the Kamienna river, opening metal plants in several locations. In 1454, Wąchock received its Magdeburg rights from King Kazimierz Jagiellończyk, and the town, together with the abbey, was frequently raided and destroyed - by the Mongols in 1259–1260 (see Mongol invasion of Poland), the Swedes in 1655, and the Transilvanians in 1657 (see The Deluge). In 1819, the abbey was taken over by the government of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and the monks did not return there until 1951. Despite the existence of a rich and powerful monastery, Wąchock itself never became an important center of Lesser Poland’s Sandomierz Voivodeship, to which it belonged until the Partitions of Poland (1795). This was because both Bishops of Kraków (who owned nearby town of Bodzentyn), and Benedictine monks from the Łysa Góra monastery blocked any attempts at Wąchock's development. In 1624, Benedictines from Święty Krzyż founded the town of Wierzbnik (later: Starachowice), which emerged as a competition to Wąchock. Nevertheless, Wąchock was one of early centers of Polish industry - in 1500, out of 289 forges in the Kingdom of Poland, as many as 22 operated here. In January 1863, soon after the January Uprising broke out, General Marian Langiewicz assembled a group of 1,400 Polish rebels, whose purpose was to attack Russian-held Warsaw. A battle with the Russians took place here on February 3, 1863. In 1869, Russian authorities, in revenge of the town's aid to the insurgents, deprived Wąchock of its city rights. The village was flooded by the Kamienna river in 1903, and in 1918, it became part of Second Polish Republic’s Kielce Voivodeship. During World War II, Home Army units under Jan Piwnik were particularly active in the area of Wąchock. There now is a monument of Jan Piwnik in the town. The town lies on National Road Nr. 42, and has a rail station on a route from Skarżysko-Kamienna to Sandomierz. Among major points of interest are: Wąchock is famous across Poland for jokes about its inhabitants, and especially their sołtys (referring to the times when Wąchock was a village). For example, the cat of the sołtys was so smart that when given some coffee with milk, he drank all the milk while leaving all the coffee. It is unclear when and why Wąchock had become a butt of the jokes, although there are several theories. Typically, the Wąchock jokes are the question-answer ones: ""Why nobody in Wąchock watches TV now? - Because sołtys put blinds on his windows."" The town organizes the annual meeting of sołtyses. In 1988 there was a documentary by Józef Gębski, with a grain of humour, about the elections of the sołtys of Wąchock, ""Sołtys Wąchocka, czyli jak ponownie wygrać wybory""  . 51°05′N 21°01′E﻿ ﻿51.083°N 21.017°E﻿ 51.083; 21.017",Normal

The Macedonian delegation consisted of three athletes, alpine skier Antonio Ristevski and two cross-country skiers, Rosana Kiroska and Darko Damjanovski. The nation's best finish was by Ristevski in the men's giant slalom, where he placed 53rd. The Olympic Committee of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 1 January 1993. The nation made its Summer Olympics debut at the 1996 Atlanta Games, and its first appearance in the Winter Olympic Games at the 1998 Nagano Olympics. Macedonia has participated in every Olympics since their respective debuts. No athlete competing for Macedonia has ever won a medal at the Winter Olympics. The Macedonian delegation to Vancouver consisted of three athletes, alpine skier Antonio Ristevski and two cross-country skiers, Rosana Kiroska and Darko Damjanovski. Ristevski was chosen as the flag bearer for both the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony. Antonio Ristevski was 20 years old at the time of the Vancouver Olympics, and would go on to represent Macedonia at the 2014 Winter Olympics.

"""You're History"" is a song by British-based pop act Shakespears Sister, released in July 1989 as the second single from their debut album, Sacred Heart (1989). The song was the first release to present the act as a duo and their first chart hit, reaching number seven in the United Kingdom. Outside the UK, ""You're History"" reached number five in Finland and entered the top 40 in Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand. ""You're History"" is the first release to present Shakespears Sister as a duo comprising Siobhan Fahey and Marcella Detroit, as opposed to a solo project by Fahey. The single sleeve depicts the two seen from the back with Detroit wielding a guitar; however, an early pressing of the single used an alternate cover depicting only Fahey. Another alternate cover is used for the ""Voodoo Remix"" single, which is similar to the cover depicting both Fahey and Detroit but features Fahey looking at Detroit instead of straight ahead. Bill Coleman from Billboard complimented the song's ""refreshing hooks"", describing it as ""danceable pop with a distinctive edge  has the goods to seduce programmers with its infectious charm."" Alison Mayes from Calgary Herald felt it's a ""stellar turn"" on the album, and ""a witty, infectious statement of female independence that dispenses with a lover by telling him to go back to sleep and comparing him with the Dead Sea scrolls."" Robert Hilburn from Los Angeles Times wrote, ""Though this kind of novelty wears out quickly, the delightfully absurd put-down of an old lover is too much fun to ignore. Siobhan Fahey is married to Dave Stewart, which may explain some of the Eurythmic tension in the arrangement."" David Giles from Music Week said, ""Fairly cluttered record built around a wailing bluesy chorus, chugging rhythm and choppy guitar. Tries very hard to be soulful, perhaps too hard."" In an 2014 retrospective review, Pop Rescue stated that both singers are on ""great vocal form"", complimenting the producer of the song, adding, ""I think that’s partly why it stands out."" A reviewer from Record Mirror declared it as a ""mildly eccentric and compelling mature pop song"". Richard Lowe from Smash Hits complimented it as ""fab"". The accompanying music video for ""You're History"", the third video directed by English director Sophie Muller for the group, was the first in which Detroit appeared. The video begins with Detroit singing the opening verse of the song in front of a red stage curtain.

"A conventional fixed-wing aircraft flight control system (AFCS) consists of flight control surfaces, the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft's direction in flight. Aircraft engine controls are also considered flight controls as they change speed. The fundamentals of aircraft controls are explained in flight dynamics. This article centers on the operating mechanisms of the flight controls. The basic system in use on aircraft first appeared in a readily recognizable form as early as April 1908, on Louis Blériot's Blériot VIII pioneer-era monoplane design. Generally, the primary cockpit flight controls are arranged as follows: The control yokes also vary greatly among aircraft. There are yokes where roll is controlled by rotating the yoke clockwisecounterclockwise (like steering a car) and pitch is controlled by moving the control column towards or away from the pilot, but in others the pitch is controlled by sliding the yoke into and out of the instrument panel (like most Cessnas, such as the 152 and 172), and in some the roll is controlled by sliding the whole yoke to the left and right (like the Cessna 162). Centre sticks also vary between aircraft. Some are directly connected to the control surfaces using cables, others (fly-by-wire airplanes) have a computer in between which then controls the electrical actuators. Even when an aircraft uses variant flight control surfaces such as a V-tail ruddervator, flaperons, or elevons, because these various combined-purpose control surfaces control rotation about the same three axes in space, the aircraft's flight control system will still be designed so that the stick or yoke controls pitch and roll conventionally, as will the rudder pedals for yaw. The basic pattern for modern flight controls was pioneered by French aviation figure Robert Esnault-Pelterie, with fellow French aviator Louis Blériot popularizing Esnault-Pelterie's control format initially on Louis' Blériot VIII monoplane in April 1908, and standardizing the format on the July 1909 Channel-crossing Blériot XI. Flight control has long been taught in such fashion for many decades, as popularized in ab initio instructional books such as the 1944 work Stick and Rudder. In some aircraft, the control surfaces are not manipulated with a linkage. In ultralight aircraft and motorized hang gliders, for example, there is no mechanism at all. Instead, the pilot just grabs the lifting surface by hand (using a rigid frame that hangs from its underside) and moves it. In addition to the primary flight controls for roll, pitch, and yaw, there are often secondary controls available to give the pilot finer control over flight or to ease the workload. The most commonly available control is a wheel or other device to control elevator trim, so that the pilot does not have to maintain constant backward or forward pressure to hold a specific pitch attitude (other types of trim, for rudder and ailerons, are common on larger aircraft but may also appear on smaller ones). Many aircraft have wing flaps, controlled by a switch or a mechanical lever or in some cases are fully automatic by computer control, which alter the shape of the wing for improved control at the slower speeds used for take-off and landing. Other secondary flight control systems may include slats, spoilers, air brakes and variable-sweep wings. Mechanical or manually operated flight control systems are the most basic method of controlling an aircraft. They were used in early aircraft and are currently used in small aircraft where the aerodynamic forces are not excessive. Very early aircraft, such as the Wright Flyer I, Blériot XI and Fokker Eindecker used a system of wing warping where no conventionally hinged control surfaces were used on the wing, and sometimes not even for pitch control as on the Wright Flyer I and original versions of the 1909 Etrich Taube, which only had a hingedpivoting rudder in addition to the warping-operated pitch and roll controls. A manual flight control system uses a collection of mechanical parts such as pushrods, tension cables, pulleys, counterweights, and sometimes chains to transmit the forces applied to the cockpit controls directly to the control surfaces. Turnbuckles are often used to adjust control cable tension. The Cessna Skyhawk is a typical example of an aircraft that uses this type of system. Gust locks are often used on parked aircraft with mechanical systems to protect the control surfaces and linkages from damage from wind. Some aircraft have gust locks fitted as part of the control system. Increases in the control surface area, and the higher airspeeds required by faster aircraft resulted in higher aerodynamic loads on the flight control systems. As a result, the forces required to move them also become significantly larger. Consequently, complicated mechanical gearing arrangements were developed to extract maximum mechanical advantage in order to reduce the forces required from the pilots. This arrangement can be found on bigger or higher performance propeller aircraft such as the Fokker 50. Some mechanical flight control systems use servo tabs that provide aerodynamic assistance. Servo tabs are small surfaces hinged to the control surfaces. The flight control mechanisms move these tabs, aerodynamic forces in turn move, or assist the movement of the control surfaces reducing the amount of mechanical forces needed. This arrangement was used in early piston-engined transport aircraft and in early jet transports. The Boeing 737 incorporates a system, whereby in the unlikely event of total hydraulic system failure, it automatically and seamlessly reverts to being controlled via servo-tab. The complexity and weight of mechanical flight control systems increase considerably with the size and performance of the aircraft. Hydraulically powered control surfaces help to overcome these limitations. With hydraulic flight control systems, the aircraft's size and performance are limited by economics rather than a pilot's muscular strength. At first, only-partially boosted systems were used in which the pilot could still feel some of the aerodynamic loads on the control surfaces (feedback). A hydro-mechanical flight control system has two parts: The pilot's movement of a control causes the mechanical circuit to open the matching servo valve in the hydraulic circuit. The hydraulic circuit powers the actuators which then move the control surfaces. As the actuator moves, the servo valve is closed by a mechanical feedback linkage - one that stops movement of the control surface at the desired position. This arrangement was found in the older-designed jet transports and in some high-performance aircraft. Examples include the Antonov An-225 and the Lockheed SR-71. With purely mechanical flight control systems, the aerodynamic forces on the control surfaces are transmitted through the mechanisms and are felt directly by the pilot, allowing tactile feedback of airspeed. With hydromechanical flight control systems, the load on the surfaces cannot be felt and there is a risk of overstressing the aircraft through excessive control surface movement. To overcome this problem, artificial feel systems can be used. For example, for the controls of the RAF's Avro Vulcan jet bomber and the RCAF's Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow supersonic interceptor (both 1950s-era designs), the required force feedback was achieved by a spring device. The fulcrum of this device was moved in proportion to the square of the air speed (for the elevators) to give increased resistance at higher speeds. For the controls of the American Vought F-8 Crusader and the LTV A-7 Corsair II warplanes, a 'bob-weight' was used in the pitch axis of the control stick, giving force feedback that was proportional to the airplane's normal acceleration. A stick shaker is a device that is attached to the control column in some hydraulic aircraft. It shakes the control column when the aircraft is approaching stall conditions. Some aircraft such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 are equipped with a back-up electrical power supply that can be activated to enable the stick shaker in case of hydraulic failure. In most current systems the power is provided to the control actuators by high-pressure hydraulic systems. In fly-by-wire systems the valves, which control these systems, are activated by electrical signals. In power-by-wire systems, electrical actuators are used in favour of hydraulic pistons. The power is carried to the actuators by electrical cables. These are lighter than hydraulic pipes, easier to install and maintain, and more reliable. Elements of the F-35 flight control system are power-by-wire. The actuators in such an electro-hydrostatic actuation (EHA) system are self-contained hydraulic devices, small closed-circuit hydraulic systems. The overall aim is towards more- or all-electric aircraft and an early example of the approach was the Avro Vulcan. Serious consideration was given to using the approach on the Airbus A380. A fly-by-wire (FBW) system replaces manual flight control of an aircraft with an electronic interface. The movements of flight controls are converted to electronic signals transmitted by wires (hence the term fly-by-wire), and flight control computers determine how to move the actuators at each control surface to provide the expected response. Commands from the computers are also input without the pilot's knowledge to stabilize the aircraft and perform other tasks. Electronics for aircraft flight control systems are part of the field known as avionics. Fly-by-optics, also known as fly-by-light, is a further development using fiber-optic cables. Several technology research and development efforts exist to integrate the functions of flight control systems such as ailerons, elevators, elevons, flaps, and flaperons into wings to perform the aerodynamic purpose with the advantages of less: mass, cost, drag, inertia (for faster, stronger control response), complexity (mechanically simpler, fewer moving parts or surfaces, less maintenance), and radar cross section for stealth. These may be used in many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and 6th generation fighter aircraft. Two promising approaches are flexible wings, and fluidics. In flexible wings, also known as ""morphing aerofoils"", much or all of a wing surface can change shape in flight to deflect air flow much like an ornithopter. Adaptive compliant wings are a military and commercial effort. The X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing was a US Air Force, NASA, and Boeing effort. Notable efforts have also been made by FlexSys, who have conducted flight tests using flexible aerofoils retrofitted to a Gulf stream III aircraft. In active flow control systems, forces in vehicles occur via circulation control, in which larger and more complex mechanical parts are replaced by smaller, simpler fluidic systems (slots which emit air flows) where larger forces in fluids are diverted by smaller jets or flows of fluid intermittently, to change the direction of vehicles. In this use, active flow control promises simplicity and lower mass, costs (up to half less), and inertia and response times. This was demonstrated in the Demon UAV, which flew for the first time in the UK in September 2010.",Normal
"Aaron D. Ford Democratic Kelvin Atkinson Democratic None of These Candidates The 2018 Nevada Senate election took place as part of the biennial United States elections. Nevada voters elected state senators in 11 of the state senate's 21 districts. State senators serve four-year terms in the Nevada State Senate. A primary election on June 12, 2018 determined which candidates appear on the November 6 general election ballot. Primary election results can be obtained from the State of Nevada's Secretary of State website. Due to resignations and appointments, on election day 2018, there were 10 Democrats, 1 independent (caucusing with Democrats), 8 Republicans, and 2 vacancies in the Nevada Senate. To claim control of the chamber from Democrats, the Republicans needed to net 3 Senate seats. Following the 2016 state senate elections, Democrats flipped control of the Senate away from the Republicans with a slim majority of 11 Democrats to 10 Republicans. On November 14, 2016, Sen.

"The history of the Jews in Transnistria is mainly connected to the history of the Jews in Moldova, the history of the Jews in Ukraine, the history of the Jews in Romania and the history of the Jews in the Soviet Union as well as to countries in several other neighboring areas. Transnistria, or Transdniestria, officially the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, is a primarily unrecognised state that split off from Moldova after the dissolution of the USSR and mostly consists of a narrow strip of land between the river Dniester and the territory of Ukraine. Transnistria has been recognised only by 3 other mostly non-recognised states: Abkhazia, Artsakh, and South Ossetia. The region is considered by the UN to be part of Moldova. The history of the Jews in Moldova reaches back several centuries. Bessarabian Jews have been living in the area for some time. Today, the Jewish community living in Moldova number less than 4,000 according to one estimate, while local estimates put the number at 15–20,000 Jews and their family members. The history of the Jews in Romania concerns the Jews both of Romania and of Romanian origins, from their first mention on what is present-day Romanian territory. Jewish communities existed in Romanian territory in the 2nd century AD. Minimal until the 18th century, the size of the Jewish population increased after around 1850, and more especially after the establishment of Greater Romania in the aftermath of World War I. A diverse community, albeit an overwhelmingly urban one, Jews were a target of religious persecution and racism in Romanian society – from the late-19th century debate over the ""Jewish Question"" and the Jewish residents' right to citizenship, to the genocide carried out in the lands of Romania as part of the Holocaust. The latter, coupled with successive waves of aliyah, has accounted for a dramatic decrease in the overall size of Romania's present-day Jewish community. The history of the Jews in Ukraine goes back over a thousand years. Jewish communities have existed in the territory of Ukraine from the time of Kievan Rus' (late 9th to mid-13th century) and developed many of the most distinctive modern Jewish theological and cultural traditions such as Hasidism. According to the World Jewish Congress, the Jewish community in Ukraine constitute the third biggest Jewish community in Europe and the fifth biggest in the world. The history of the Jews in Russia and on areas historically connected with it goes back at least 1500 years. The presence of Jewish people in the European part of Russia can be traced to the 7th–14th centuries CE. Jews in Russia have historically constituted a large religious diaspora; the vast territories of the Russian Empire at one time hosted the largest population of Jews in the world. Within these territories the primarily Ashkenazi Jewish communities of many different areas flourished and developed many of modern Judaism's most distinctive theological and cultural traditions, while also facing periods of anti-Semitic discriminatory policies and persecutions. The largest group among Russian Jews are Ashkenazi Jews, but the community also includes a significant proportion of other non-Ashkenazi from other Jewish diaspora including Mountain Jews, Sephardic Jews, Crimean Karaites, Krymchaks, Bukharan Jews, and Georgian Jews. The history of the Jews in Bessarabia, a historical region in Eastern Europe, dates back hundreds of years. Jews are mentioned from very early in the Principality of Moldavia, but they did not represent a significant number. Their main activity in Moldavia was commerce, but they could not compete with Greeks and Armenians, who had knowledge of Levantine commerce and relationships.",Normal

"The African Grove Theatre opened in New York City in 1821. It was founded and operated by William Alexander Brown, a free black man from the West Indies. It opened six years before the final abolition of slavery in New York state (gradual abolition brought it to an end in 1827, but young people born to slave mothers had to serve apprenticeships to age 21). The African Grove Theatre was attended by ""all types of black New Yorkers -- free and slave, middle-class and working-class"" along with others. It was the first place where Ira Aldridge, who would later become an esteemed and renowned Shakespearian actor, first saw a production of a Shakespeare play. For some years, the African Company—the company of the African Grove—played classics and many other plays with an entirely black cast and crew to mostly black audiences. It was the third of at least four attempts to create a black theater in the city, and the most commercially successful. At one point the theatre had to build an extra level of seats to house white audiences that wanted to see the performances. After a few years, city officials shut down the African Grove, because of complaints about conduct: conduct that was normal among working-class white New York theatre audiences of the time was considered unacceptably boisterous when displayed by blacks. It is thought that the real reason was because this black theatre was becoming as successful as many other venues. One source says that the theatre was ""mysteriously burned to the ground in 1826"". ""There are no records of the African Grove Theater after 1823."" The theatre was founded by William Alexander Brown, a pioneering actor and playwright from the West Indies. He had worked as a ship's steward at times. Through his work as a ship's steward, he traveled to England and the Caribbean, so he had a broader opportunity to see theatre than the typical New Yorker. The West-Indies-born Brown left a job on a Liverpool ship and bought a house in New York, at 38 Thomas Street. At the start, Brown held performances of the African Grove in his back yard, where he offered food and drink, but also poetry and short drama pieces. At the suggestion of James Hewlett, both an entertainer and a regular customer, together they hired other black actors. The theater's repertoire drew heavily on Shakespeare, with comic entr'actes. White audience members were confined to a separate section because, in the words of the theater's management, ""whites do not know how to conduct themselves at entertainments for ladies and gentlemen of color."" The most popular plays were Richard III and Othello. James Hewlett was the first black man of record to play the leading role in Othello. As was common at the time, the producers adapted Shakespeare's plays. Small casts and smaller budgets required expedients such as that described by the reviewer George Odell, writing of an 1821 performance of Richard III: ""A dapper, wooly haired waiter at the City Hotel personated the royal Plantagenet in robes made up from discarded merino curtains of the ballroom. Owing to the smallness of the company King Henry and the Duchess were played by one person, and Lady Anne and Catesby by another. Lady Anne, in Act III, sang quite incongruously."" The scholar Laura V. Blanchard identifies Odell's ""dapper waiter"" as the actor James Hewlett. Frequently harassed by the police, and facing increasing hostility from the white populace, the company moved several times, from Thomas Street north to Bleecker and Mercer Streets. At the time this was the edge of the developed parts of New York City. When Brown moved his theatre from 38 Thomas Street to Bleecker and Mercer Streets, he had a dilemma. Realizing that his theatre now was located too far from its core audience (""free persons of color""), he constructed a theatre building which was near a popular white theater called the Park Theatre. When the Park Theatre—New York City's leading theater of the time— put on Richard III starring the English tragedian Junius Brutus Booth, the African Company rented a hall next door for its own production of the same play the same night. Theatrical competition was stiff; Stephen Price, owner of the Park, orchestrated (and paid for) a disturbance over the rival productions so that the police would shut down the African Grove. In addition to Shakespeare, the African Company performed original works, which included William A. Brown's now-lost play, The Drama of King Shotaway. The play depicted the involvement of Garifuna leader Joseph Chatoyer in the Second Carib War on the island of Saint Vincent. Produced by the African Company in 1823, Drama is believed to have been the first full-length play by a black American performed in the United States. Despite the frequent changes in location and its short period of productions, the African Grove Theatre was important as a venue for noted African-American actors, such as James Hewlett. 40°43′23″N 74°00′14″W﻿ ﻿40.723°N 74.004°W﻿ 40.723; -74.004",Normal

"In population genetics, Ewens's sampling formula, describes the probabilities associated with counts of how many different alleles are observed a given number of times in the sample. Ewens's sampling formula, introduced by Warren Ewens, states that under certain conditions (specified below), if a random sample of n gametes is taken from a population and classified according to the gene at a particular locus then the probability that there are a1 alleles represented once in the sample, and a2 alleles represented twice, and so on, is for some positive number θ representing the population mutation rate, whenever a 1 , … , a n {displaystyle a_{1},ldots ,a_{n}} is a sequence of nonnegative integers such that The phrase ""under certain conditions"" used above is made precise by the following assumptions: This is a probability distribution on the set of all partitions of the integer n. Among probabilists and statisticians it is often called the multivariate Ewens distribution. When θ=0, the probability is 1 that all n genes are the same. When θ=1, then the distribution is precisely that of the integer partition induced by a uniformly distributed random permutation. As θ→∞, the probability that no two of the n genes are the same approaches1. This family of probability distributions enjoys the property that if after the sample of n is taken, m of the n gametes are chosen without replacement, then the resulting probability distribution on the set of all partitions of the smaller integer m is just what the formula above would give if m were put in place ofn. The Ewens distribution arises naturally from the Chinese restaurant process.",Normal

"The Union of Municipal and State Workers (German: Verband der Gemeinde- und Staatsarbeiter, VGS) was a trade union representing public sector workers in Germany. In September 1896, gas workers in Berlin went on strike in opposition to having to work for 18 hours on Sundays. Bruno Poersch, leader of the local union of saddlers, supported the strike, and helped found a union to represent them. This was officially established on 4 October, under the name the Union of Gas, Wood, Coal, and Other Workers, and by the end of the year, it had launched a journal. Poersch aimed to develop the union into one representing municipal workers, and so in 1897, the coal and wood workers were transferred to the German Transport Workers' Union, and the union became the Association of Gas and Other Municipal Workers, recruiting water, sewage, lighting, market and slaughterhouse workers, as well as inspectors of gas works. Section were established for each industry, and in 1899, the union was accepted into the social democratic trade union movement. Under Poersch, the union took inspiration from the British trade union movement and notably argued that workers could best protect their interests if they worked for a single employer, and that strikes should be avoided whenever possible. It also argued for wages linked to seniority and the number of children each employee had, and for the unions to be politically neutral. These positions were unpopular with the rest of the trade union movement, and led Poersch to resign in 1906. He was replaced by Albin Mohs, who proved more malleable, and accepted frequent demands for specialist public sector workers to be represented by industrial unions. Under Mohs, the union renamed itself as the ""Union of Municipal and State Workers"". It grew, and by 1910 had 39,262, an estimated 26% of all workers in the sector. In 1909, the union's conference voted to replaced Mohs with Richard Heckmann, by 26 votes to 25, but in view of the closeness of the vote, Heckmann refused the position, and Mohs continued. He had been general secretary of the International Secretariat of the Workers in Public Services since 1907, and from 1914 was paid for the role, allowing Heckmann to replace him as leader of the German union. Under Heckmann, the union focused on negotiating collective agreements. It persuaded several small, local unions to merge in, and it signed agreements with larger unions which had some public sector workers. It was a founding member of the General German Trade Union Confederation in 1919, by 1922 had about 300,000 members. By the start of 1930, union membership had fallen slightly, to 266,000 members.

"San Frediano is a Romanesque-style Roman Catholic church in Pisa, Tuscany, Italy. It now functions as the official church of the University of Pisa. Its existence is documented as early as 1061. Founded by the family Buzzaccherini-Sismondi and originally dedicated to Saint Martin, it once had a hospital annexed to it. The Romanesque façade, dating to the early 12th-century shows some of the typical features of the Pisan Romanesque style, such as the blind arcades, the lozenges and the use of bichrome stones (present also in the city's cathedral). The upper section is crowned by a large mullioned window. The interior, despite being damaged by fire in 1675, has maintained the original basilica plan with a central nave and two aisles. The marble columns have capitals decorated with Romanesque-style sculpted figures. It houses a rare wooden cross painted on a gilded panel and titled the Crucifix and Histories of the Passion (12th century), several Baroque altars and a few 17th-century paintings by Ventura Salimbeni (Annunciation and Nativity), Aurelio Lomi (Adoration of the Magi), as well as frescoes by Domenico Passignano. The frescoes of the dome were completed by Rutilio Manetti. The sturdy bell tower is in brickwork. 43°43′05″N 10°23′58″E﻿ ﻿43.717964°N 10.399372°E﻿ 43.717964; 10.399372",Normal

"The University of Évora (Universidade de Évora) is a public university in Évora, Portugal. It is the second oldest university in the country, established in 1559 by the cardinal Henry, and receiving University status in April of the same year from Pope Paul IV, as documented in his Cum a nobis papal bull. Running under the aegis of the Society of Jesus (also known as Jesuits) meant that the university was a target of the Marquis of Pombal's Jesuit oppression, being closed down permanently in 1779 and its masters either incarcerated or exiled. It was reopened nearly two hundred years later in 1973 as Instituto Universitário de Évora (University Institute of Évora) by decree of the Minister of Education, José Veiga Simão, in the site of the older university, as part of a set of education policies during the early 1970s that were attempting to reshape Portuguese higher education. Six years later, in 1979, the name was changed to Universidade de Évora. The University of Évora, the second oldest in Portugal, was founded in the 16th century by the Archbishop of Évora Cardinal Infante Dom Henrique, future king of Portugal, and the Pope Paul IV. Its administrative control was granted to the newly formed Society of Jesus. This measure could be seen as part of Henry's policies to attract Jesuits to the kingdom. The Jesuit college in Évora operated between 1559 and 1759, when it was surrounded by cavalry troops on February 8 of 1759, as a consequence of the Jesuit banishment promoted by the Minister of the Kingdom Marquis of Pombal. The Colégio do Espírito Santo became famed as a centre of learning and rivalled the University of Coimbra. Among its eminent theologians and philosophers were Luis de Molina (1535-1600), Pedro de Fonseca (1528-1599), St. Francisco de Borja, St. João de Brito, Manuel Álvares. Several prelates of the Portuguese Empire were trained at this university: D. Afonso Mendes, Patriarch of Abyssinia, and D. Pedro Martins, first bishop of Japan. The classrooms are decorated with appropriate azulejos (ceramic tiles) such as ""Plato teaching his followers"" and ""Aristotle teaching Alexander the Great"". The University of Évora resumed work in 1973 as a state-run university. The diplomas are granted in the 18th century Baroque chapel (Sala dos Actos) (restored in 1973), that dominates the Tuscan-arched Renaissance cloister.

"Secure voice (alternatively secure speech or ciphony) is a term in cryptography for the encryption of voice communication over a range of communication types such as radio, telephone or IP. The implementation of voice encryption dates back to World War II when secure communication was paramount to the US armed forces. During that time, noise was simply added to a voice signal to prevent enemies from listening to the conversations. Noise was added by playing a record of noise in sync with the voice signal and when the voice signal reached the receiver, the noise signal was subtracted out, leaving the original voice signal. In order to subtract out the noise, the receiver need to have exactly the same noise signal and the noise records were only made in pairs; one for the transmitter and one for the receiver. Having only two copies of records made it impossible for the wrong receiver to decrypt the signal. To implement the system, the army contracted Bell Laboratories and they developed a system called SIGSALY. With SIGSALY, ten channels were used to sample the voice frequency spectrum from 250Hz to 3kHz and two channels were allocated to sample voice pitch and background hiss. In the time of SIGSALY, the transistor had not been developed and the digital sampling was done by circuits using the model 2051 Thyratron vacuum tube. Each SIGSALY terminal used 40 racks of equipment weighing 55 tons and filled a large room. This equipment included radio transmitters and receivers and large phonograph turntables. The voice was keyed to two 410-millimetre (16in) vinyl phonograph records that contained a Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) audio tone. The records were played on large precise turntables in sync with the voice transmission. From the introduction of voice encryption to today, encryption techniques have evolved drastically. Digital technology has effectively replaced old analog methods of voice encryption and by using complex algorithms, voice encryption has become much more secure and efficient. One relatively modern voice encryption method is Sub-band coding. With Sub-band Coding, the voice signal is split into multiple frequency bands, using multiple bandpass filters that cover specific frequency ranges of interest. The output signals from the bandpass filters are then lowpass translated to reduce the bandwidth, which reduces the sampling rate. The lowpass signals are then quantized and encoded using special techniques like, pulse-code modulation (PCM). After the encoding stage, the signals are multiplexed and sent out along the communication network. When the signal reaches the receiver, the inverse operations are applied to the signal to get it back to its original state. A speech scrambling system was developed at Bell Laboratories in the 1970s by Subhash Kak and Nikil Jayant. In this system permutation matrices were used to scramble coded representations (such as pulse-code modulation and variants) of the speech data. Motorola developed a voice encryption system called Digital Voice Protection (DVP) as part of their first generation of voice encryption techniques. DVP uses a self-synchronizing encryption technique known as cipher feedback (CFB). The extremely high number of possible keys associated with the early DVP algorithm, makes the algorithm very robust and gives a high level of security. As with other symmetric keyed encryption systems, the encryption key is required to decrypt the signal with a special decryption algorithm. A digital secure voice usually includes two components, a digitizer to convert between speech and digital signals and an encryption system to provide confidentiality. It is difficult in practice to send the encrypted signal over the same voiceband communication circuits used to transmit unencrypted voice, e.g. analog telephone lines or mobile radios, due to bandwidth expansion. This has led to the use of Voice Coders (vocoders) to achieve tight bandwidth compression of the speech signals. NSA's STU-III, KY-57 and SCIP are examples of systems that operate over existing voice circuits. The STE system, by contrast, requires wide bandwidth ISDN lines for its normal mode of operation. For encrypting GSM and VoIP, which are natively digital, the standard protocol ZRTP could be used as an end-to-end encryption technology. Secure voice's robustness greatly benefits from having the voice data compressed into very low bit-rates by special component called speech coding, voice compression or voice coder (also known as vocoder). The old secure voice compression standards include (CVSD, CELP, LPC-10e and MELP, where the latest standard is the state of the art MELPe algorithm. The MELPe or enhanced-MELP (Mixed Excitation Linear Prediction) is a United States Department of Defense speech coding standard used mainly in military applications and satellite communications, secure voice, and secure radio devices. Its development was led and supported by NSA, and NATO. The US government's MELPe secure voice standard is also known as MIL-STD-3005, and the NATO's MELPe secure voice standard is also known as STANAG-4591. The initial MELP was invented by Alan McCree around 1995. That initial speech coder was standardized in 1997 and was known as MIL-STD-3005. It surpassed other candidate vocoders in the US DoD competition, including: (a) Frequency Selective Harmonic Coder (FSHC), (b) Advanced Multi-Band Excitation (AMBE), (c) Enhanced Multiband Excitation (EMBE), (d) Sinusoid Transform Coder (STC), and (e) Subband LPC Coder (SBC). Due to its lower complexity than Waveform Interpolative (WI) coder, the MELP vocoder won the DoD competition and was selected for MIL-STD-3005. Between 1998 and 2001, a new MELP-based vocoder was created at half the rate (i.e. 1200 bits) and substantial enhancements were added to the MIL-STD-3005 by SignalCom (later acquired by Microsoft), AT&T Corporation, and Compandent which included (a) additional new vocoder at half the rate (i.e. 1200 bits), (b) substantially improved encoding (analysis), (c) substantially improved decoding (synthesis), (d) Noise-Preprocessing for removing background noise, (e) transcoding between the 2400 bits and 1200 bits bitstreams, and (f) new postfilter. This fairly significant development was aimed to create a new coder at half the rate and have it interoperable with the old MELP standard. This enhanced-MELP (also known as MELPe) was adopted as the new MIL-STD-3005 in 2001 in form of annexes and supplements made to the original MIL-STD-3005, enabling the same quality as the old 2400 bits MELP's at half the rate. One of the greatest advantages of the new 2400 bits MELPe is that it shares the same bit format as MELP, and hence can interoperate with legacy MELP systems, but would deliver better quality at both ends. MELPe provides much better quality than all older military standards, especially in noisy environments such as battlefield and vehicles and aircraft. In 2002, following extensive competition and testing, the 2400 and 1200 bits US DoD MELPe was adopted also as NATO standard, known as STANAG-4591. As part of NATO testing for new NATO standard, MELPe was tested against other candidates such as France's HSX (Harmonic Stochastic eXcitation) and Turkey's SB-LPC (Split-Band Linear Predictive Coding), as well as the old secure voice standards such as FS1015 LPC-10e (2.4 kbits), FS1016 CELP (4.8 kbits) and CVSD (16 kbits). Subsequently, the MELPe won also the NATO competition, surpassing the quality of all other candidates as well as the quality of all old secure voice standards (CVSD, CELP and LPC-10e). The NATO competition concluded that MELPe substantially improved performance (in terms of speech quality, intelligibility, and noise immunity), while reducing throughput requirements. The NATO testing also included interoperability tests, used over 200 hours of speech data, and was conducted by 3 test laboratories worldwide. Compandent Inc, as a part of MELPe-based projects performed for NSA and NATO, provided NSA and NATO with special test-bed platform known as MELCODER device that provided the golden reference for real-time implementation of MELPe. The low-cost FLEXI-232 Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) made by Compandent, which are based on the MELCODER golden reference, are very popular and widely used for evaluating and testing MELPe in real-time, various channels & networks, and field conditions. The NATO competition concluded that MELPe substantially improved performance (in terms of speech quality, intelligibility, and noise immunity), while reducing throughput requirements. The NATO testing also included interoperability tests, used over 200 hours of speech data, and was conducted by 3 test laboratories worldwide. In 2005, a new 600 bits rate MELPe variation by Thales Group (France) was added (without extensive competition and testing as performed for the 24001200 bits MELPe)  to the NATO standard STANAG-4591, and there are more advanced efforts to lower the bitrates to 300 bits and even 150 bits. In 2010 Lincoln Labs., Compandent, BBN, and General Dynamics also developed for DARPA a 300 bits MELP device . Its quality was better than the 600 bits MELPe, but its delay was longer.",Normal

"Kien An Airport (Vietnamese language: Sân bay Kiến An) is a military airport, a standby airport for Cat Bi Airport in Haiphong, northern Vietnam. The single runway is 2,400 m, concrete surface. Its ICAO code is VV03. Kien An Airport is located in Kiến An District, Hải Phòng, 10km from Cat Bi Airport to the west. The airfield was constructed during the French colonial period. The airfield was reportedly constructed over a 2-year period with large amounts of crushed rock being used to build foundations on the marshy land. The first French aircraft to land at Kien An apparently buckled the runway and the project was abandoned by the French. The base was put into service by the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF). In July 1966 the National Photographic Interpretation Center reported that Kien An Airfield comprised ""a 5900 ft x 150 ft, NESW, serviceable runway, resurfaced since October 1965. The airfield has a parallel taxiway with two end-connecting links, and a parking apron. An aircraft dispersal area contains seventeen revetted hardstands and eighteen hardstands recessed into the base of a hill at the southeast section of the airfield. Support facilities include one large probable maintenance building (where Hook helicopters are being assembled) and numerous support buildings. A probable ILS is located off the southwest end of the runway. Defenses in the immediate area include at least three eight-gun AAA sites. Aircraft at the airfield include four Hook helicopters without rotors in the process of being assembled, one probable Fresco (this is the first time a jet-type aircraft has been observed at this airfield), three Colt and one Hound."" On 14 April 1966 the VPAF deployed MiG-1517s and at least 4 MiG-21s to Kien An and on 17 April these aircraft engaged United States' aircraft. Due to its proximity to Haiphong, the base was in the restricted area that US forces were prohibited from attacking, allowing the VPAF aircraft there to operate without the threat of air attack. The restricted area around Haiphong was reduced in March 1967 and the first US air attack on the base took place on 23 April 1967. On 19 November 1967 4 MiG-17s deployed from Kép Air Base to Kien An intercepted a United States Navy strike package near the base, shooting down 2 F-4B Phantom IIs of VF-151. On 26 August 1972 during Operation Linebacker U.S. Navy jets bombed the base. During Operation Linebacker II in December 1972 the base was repeatedly struck by U.S. Navy aircraft causing extensive damage. On 21 December 1972 the AAA defenses at the base shot down A-6 Intruder BuNo 152946 of VA-75 as it made a night attack on the base, both crewmen were killed.",Normal

Some 49.38 hectares (122.0 acres) of this area was used for the red wines in 2007. The total amount produced corresponds to around 1.1 million bottles, of which just over 800,000 bottles of white wine and just over 300,000 bottles of red wine. For white wines, the AOC regulations allow both Chardonnay and Pinot blanc to be used, but most wines are 100% Chardonnay. The AOC regulations also allow up to 15 per cent total of Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris as accessory grapes in the red wines, but this not very often practiced. The allowed base yield is 40 hectoliter per hectare of red wine and 45 hectoliter per hectare for white wine. The grapes must reach a maturity of at least 10.5 per cent potential alcohol for village-level red wine, 11.0 per cent for village-level white wine and Premier Cru red wine, and 11.5 per cent for Premier Cru white wine. There are 20 climats in Saint-Aubin classified as Premier Cru vineyards. One group of vineyards in the eastern part of the commune is contiguous with Premier Cru vineyards of Chassagne-Montrachet, and continue up a south-facing slope situated a little to the west of the Montrachet vineyard. Another group is situated on an east-facing slope in the side valley, forming a band immediately above the village of Saint-Aubin itself. The village of Gamay is situated between these two groups of vineyards. The wines of these vineyards are designated Saint-Aubin Premier Cru + vineyard name, or may labelled just Saint-Aubin Premier Cru, in which case it is possible to blend wine from several Premier Cru vineyards within the AOC. In 2007, 127.48 hectares (315.0 acres) of the total Saint-Aubin vineyard surface consisted of Premier Cru vineyards, of which 94.98 hectares (234.7 acres) white and 32.50 hectares (80.3 acres) red Saint-Aubin Premier Cru. The annual production of Premier Cru wine, as a five-year average, is 4,239 hectoliter of white wine and 1,489 hectoliter of red wine. The climats classified as Premiers Crus are: 46°57′15″N 4°43′02″E﻿ ﻿46.9542°N 4.7172°E﻿ 46.9542; 4.7172",Normal
"The FAW Premier Cup (until 1998 the FAW Invitation Cup) was a Welsh football cup competition, organised annually by the Football Association of Wales from 1997 to 2008. Since the FAW excluded clubs playing in English leagues (including six Welsh clubs) from playing in the Welsh Cup from 1996 onwards, the FAW needed another competition where the best Welsh teams could compete. The original format incorporated the three Welsh clubs then playing in the Football League (Cardiff City, Swansea City and Wrexham) along with Merthyr Tydfil and four League of Wales clubs (now the Welsh Premier League). Until the 2001–02 season, Merthyr Tydfil had a guaranteed place, as Newport County and Colwyn Bay were not invited to take part. From then onwards, the highest placed of the three were invited. Colwyn Bay never subsequently qualified. From the 2004–05 season, the competition was expanded to 16 clubs – the top 10 placed clubs from the Welsh Premier League, joined by the two best-placed of the three teams: Newport County, Merthyr Tydfil and Colwyn Bay, the Welsh Cup winners plus Cardiff City, Swansea City and Wrexham. The competition offered a healthy prize fund. A share of the TV coverage money for live matches was also split between both clubs. The losing semi-final teams each received £25,000. The losing finalists received £50,000, with the winners receiving £100,000. The competition's most senior clubs were accused of taking the competition lightly. Cardiff City in particular, following the arrival of ambitious owner Sam Hammam enjoyed relative success in the Football League but Cardiff City won the FAW Premier Cup just once, beating arch-rivals Swansea City in the 2002 final. Wrexham appeared in all but three finals. The only Welsh Premier League clubs to have played in the final are Barry Town, Rhyl, The New Saints and Llanelli. The 2007 final was the first final not to include one of the English Football League clubs. In the last final, on 11 March 2008, Newport County beat Llanelli at Newport Stadium. The FAW Premier Cup was broadcast on BBC Wales. However, after BBC Wales withdrew their sponsorship of the competition in 2008, the competition was cancelled. In the 2011-12 season the FAW announced that the six exiled clubs would again be invited to play in the Welsh Cup. Merthyr Town, Newport County and Wrexham all accepted but Cardiff City, Colwyn Bay and Swansea City rejected the invitation. However, because UEFA refused to give any of these clubs entry into the Europa League by this route, these clubs did not enter the Welsh Cup in the following season.",Normal

"""Diddley Daddy"" is a song by Bo Diddley. The song was issued as a single on Checker Records in June 1955. His second single, it followed on the heels of the success of the eponymous ""Bo Diddley."" The song spent four weeks on the Billboard R&B chart in the summer of 1955, peaking at No. 11. The song was recorded on May 15, 1955, in Chicago. Originally called ""Diddy Diddy Dum Dum,"" it started out as a Billy Boy Arnold composition, which Leonard Chess, owner of Chess Records (Checkers was a subsidiary label of Chess), had heard Arnold play and wanted Diddley to record. However, Arnold had just signed a contract with Vee-Jay Records, and had recorded the song the day before at Universal Recording Corporation. When Chess wanted Arnold to sing the song, the latter realized he had a contract, responding, ""I can't do it...I just recorded it for Vee-Jay."" Chess responded, ""Goddam! Ain't this a bitch!"" A solution, however, was found on the spot: Diddley and Harvey Fuqua, who happened to be around, rewrote the lyrics. As it happened, the harmonica player Little Walter was in the studio, and he asked Billy Boy Arnold for his harp; Walter plays the long solo after the first verse (Arnold plays harmonica on the B-side, ""She's Fine, She's Mine""). Also decided at ""the spur of the moment"" was to have Chicago doo-wop group The Moonglows sing background vocals. One of Bo Diddley's signature songs, ""Diddley Daddy"" evidenced Diddley's maturation process as an artist. It was described as a ""terrific nugget"" and an ""infectious"" ""upbeat rocker"". The Chicago Sun-Times said it combined ""outrageous braggadocio with a beat that resounds like an endless sexual shudder."" Marking Diddley's popularity in England, the Rolling Stones, who early in their career often played Diddley songs live, covered the song (along with Diddley's ""Road Runner"") on their first demo, recorded on March 11, 1963. Brian Jones would later borrow Diddley's guitar figure from the song for the band's 1965 single ""19th Nervous Breakdown"". The title of the song has come to stand for Bo Diddley himself, as evidenced from articles about Diddley by Val Wilmer and Stuart Colman. After Diddley's death, in 2008, the phrase directly referred to Diddley in various obituaries; the usage reflected Diddley's habit of self-reference as well as the way others talked about him, such as Tom Petty: ""Elvis is King. But Diddley is Daddy."" A Bo Diddley compilation CD issued in 1988 is also called Diddley Daddy. The song is featured on many greatest hits albums by Bo Diddley including 16 All-Time Greatest Hits and His Best.",Normal
"The Oghuz languages are a sub-branch of the Turkic language family, spoken by approximately 108 million people. The three languages with the largest number of speakers are Turkish, Azerbaijani and Turkmen, which, combined, account for more than 95% of speakers of this sub-branch. Kara-Khanid scholar Mahmud al-Kashgari, who lived in the 11th century, stated that the Oghuz language was the simplest among all Turkic languages. Swedish turcologist and linguist Lars Johanson notes that Oghuz languages form a clearly discernible and closely related bloc within the Turkic language family as the cultural and political history of the speakers of Oghuz languages has linked them more closely up to the modern age. Western Oghuz languages are highly mutually intelligible with each other and the Crimean Tatar language, which, though genetically Kipchak Turkic rather than Oghuz, has been heavily influenced by Turkish over several centuries. The ancestor of Oghuz languages is a matter of debate. The language of the oldest stone monuments such as Orkhon inscriptions, and documents such as Old Uyghur manuscripts are rather the ancestor of Karluk and Kipchak Turkic languages. Oghuz languages apparently originate from the language of the people known as ""Western Turgut"" in Chinese annals. Old Anatolian and Old Ottoman languages, known as Middle Turkic, would be the most ancient within the Oghuz group of Turkic languages. The term ""Oghuz"" is applied to the southwestern branch of the Common Turkic languages. It is in reference to the Oghuz Turks, who migrated from the Altay Mountains to Central Asia in the 8th century and further expanded to the Middle East and to the Balkans as separate tribes. The Oghuz languages currently spoken have been classified into three categories based on their features and geography: Western, Eastern, and Southern. Two further languages, Crimean Tatar and Urum, are Kipchak languages, but have been heavily influenced by the Oghuz languages. The extinct Pecheneg language was probably Oghuz, but as it is poorly documented, it is difficult to further classify it within the Oghuz family; it is therefore usually excluded from classification. The Oghuz languages share a number of features that have led linguists to classify them together. Some of the features are shared with other Turkic languages, and others are unique to the Oghuz family. Swedish turcologist and linguist Lars Johanson notes that Oghuz languages form a clearly discernible and closely related bloc within the Turkic language family as the cultural and political history of the speakers of Oghuz languages has linked them more closely up to the modern age. The remarkable similarity between Oghuz languages may be demonstrated through a sentence, which employs a verbal noun in the dative as a link between the main verb and auxiliary. This feature is universally shared by all Oghuz languages. Turcologist Julian Rentzsch uses this particular sentence in his work titled ""Uniformity and diversity in Turkic inceptive constructions"": English: ‘The dead man rose, sat down and began to speak.’",Normal

"The Historical Records Survey (HRS) was a project of the Works Progress Administration New Deal program in the United States. Originally part of the Federal Writers' Project, it was devoted to surveying and indexing historically significant records in state, county and local archives. The official mission statement was the ""discovery, preservation, and listing of basic materials for research in the history of the United States"". The creation of the Historical Records Survey was one of the signal events ""in what Solon Buck called the 'archival awakening' of the 1930s"". Organized on November 15, 1935 under the direction of Luther H. Evans, the Survey began life under the Federal Writers' Project and in October 1936, became an independent section of Federal Project Number One and the Works Progress Administration's Women's and Professional Division. The project was granted a budget of US$1,195,800 (equivalent to about $25,523,940 in 2022) twice over: one budget was for a survey of federal records located outside of Washington, D.C., and another budget in the same amount was for a survey of state and local historical records. In 1939, with more artistic federal programs under attack from Congress, partly because they employed suspected Communists, the less controversial HRS was moved to the Work Projects Administration Research and Records Program, Professional and Service Division. Over the course of the program, HRS employed upwards of 10,000 American workers. Base pay for a month's work was between $50 and $60. In 1939 the federal government handed off the program's activities to willing state governments; each state had its own supervisor co-ordinating the Survey's activities. The HRC, headquartered in Washington, D.C., was organized into subdivisions (regional, state, district) and much of the work was done at the behest of the National Archives and Records Administration or state archive agencies. The HRS sometimes cooperated with the Daughters of the American Revolution and other volunteer groups with an interest in local history and genealogy. As noted in Evans' obituary in American Archivist, ""Survey workers were active in every county of every state, in every state capitol, and in thousands of town halls."" The HRS was generally considered the most efficient and inexpensive of the Federal One projects. However, because of the program's short lifespan, many of the indexes were not published and remain in only piecemeal form in local and state record repositories. Evans' deputy Sargent B. Child became HRS director in March 1940 after Evans took a job with the Library of Congress' Legislative Services Division. Child served until 1942. In 1942, the HRS was reorganized under the Works Progress Administration Service Division War Service Section, which later discontinued ""fact-finding, survey, records and clerical services"" as superfluous to the war effort. Pursuant to a Presidential letter of December 4, 1942, the HRS program was shut down February 1, 1943. To bring together the records of the past and to house them in buildings where they will be preserved for the use of men living in the future, a nation must believe in three things. It must believe in the past. It must believe in the future. It must, above all, believe in the capacity of its people so to learn from the past that they can gain in Judgment for the creation of the future. According to regional historian Clifton Dale Foster, ""In most states, several diverse projects were operating simultaneously. Its largest project was the Survey of County Records, which located, identified, arranged, and described massive amounts of public records found in county archives. The result was the publication of some 628 volumes of inventories. Other programs of major importance included the Survey of Federal Archives, directed by Philip M. Hamer; the Survey of Church Records; and the American Imprints Inventory."" Other accomplishments included the Soundex indexes for several of the states for several of the turn-of-the-century U.S. Censuses (1880, 1900, 1910, 1920), indexes of vital statistics, book indexes, bibliographies, lists of newspapers, cemetery indexes and newspaper indexes, the Atlas of Congressional Roll Calls Project, ""a continuation of Richardson's Messages and Papers of the Presidents"", a historical index of American musicians, surveys of portraits in public buildings, maritime records, and a necessary survey of the federal Archives—NARA itself had been established only in 1934. As an example, the HRS documentation for Massachusetts included: ""forty-five bundles of town inventories; ten bundles of county inventories; fourteen bundles relating to church records; four bundles of material gathered for a 'Guide to Manuscripts Relating to the Negro in Massachusetts'; ten bundles related to portraits, engravings, silhouettes; and more besides"". Each state operated independently and many produced interesting regional miscellany. The achievements of the extensive Wisconsin records survey, for one, included the usual indices as well as further: ""a guide to the newspapers of one county, an index of governor's messages, a history of Galesville University, a style manual, a directory of U.S. government agencies in the state, and a checklist of statutory requirements for county records"". The Survey also innovated in archival practice. For example, it made use of new microfilm technology, experimented with its use in archiving, and advanced on previously existing practices. A great deal of HRS work-product went unpublished; for example the HRS inventoried the historical records of more than 3,000 of the 3,143 U.S. counties but only published reports for 628 of them. A study of HRS usage found that HRS materials were often confused with FWP work product, and that genealogists and archivists were the most frequent users of HRS materials. Archivists sometimes use them as evidence that certain county or town-level materials were extant circa the 1930s, in hopes of urging local record keepers to release materials they hardly knew they had.",Normal

"Johann (Johannes) Speth (9 November 1664 – after 1719) was a German organist and composer. He was born in Speinshart, some 150km from Nuremberg, but spent most of his life in Augsburg, where he worked as cathedral organist for two years. His only surviving music is a 1693 collection, Ars Magna Consoni et Dissoni, which includes toccatas, Magnificat versets and variations in the south German style. Speth was born in Speinshart, Bavaria, to teacher Heinrich Speth and his wife Margareta (née Vichtl). Past scholars established that Speth must have received music lessons from the abbot of the Premonstratensian monastery at Speinshart, one Dominikus Lieblein; however, this has recently been disproven. Nothing is known about his life before 1692, when he applied for the position of organist of Augsburg Cathedral. The application, which contained Speth's compositions, was accepted, and he was appointed organist on 4 November 1692. The music he supplied with the application was published the next year in Augsburg as Ars magna Consoni et Dissoni. In the files of the cathedral administration there is a note from 1705 showing that Speth had also to work in the office of the cathedral chapter. The exact date of Speth's death is unknown, but there is a document that shows that in 1719, he still lived with his wife and a maidservant in Augsburg. The composer's only surviving work is the collection published in 1693 in Augsburg, Ars magna Consoni et Dissoni. The title may be a reference to Athanasius Kircher's famous book, Musurgia universalis, sive ars magna consoni et dissoni (1650). An early description of the work was included by Johann Gottfried Walther in his Musikalisches Lexicon; Walther claimed Speth only compiled the pieces but did not compose. This hypothesis is now generally considered false. Ars Magna contains music intended for organ or clavichord: ten toccatas (subtitled Musicalische Blumen-Felder), eight Magnificat settings, and three variation sets. The music has clearly traceable Italian influences, with direct borrowings: one of the variation sets is built on a theme by Bernardo Pasquini, there is also a passage from Bernardo Storace in the Spangioletta variation set, and a verset by Alessandro Poglietti (quinti toni no. 3). The influence of contemporary southern organists is also apparent, particularly that of Georg Muffat and Johann Caspar Ferdinand Fischer. The toccatas are unusually short for the genre; most consist of three (toccata-fugue-toccata) sections. There are some interesting features such as dynamic indications in Toccata quarta. The Magnificat settings are, like similar pieces by Johann Kaspar Kerll and others, short versets for alternatim practice.",Normal
"Hatsuo Royama (盧山 初雄, Royama Hatsuo, born 31 March 1948) also known by his Korean name of Noh Cho Woong (Hangul: 노초웅; Hanja: 盧初雄) is a master of Kyokushin Karate and was current Kancho (Director) of the Kyokushin-kan International Organization Honbu, one faction of the International Karate Organization (IKO) founded by Mas Oyama (1923–1994) until April 2022. Hatsuo Royama was born in Yago, Gyoda City of the Saitama Prefecture. During the fall of his first year of high school in 1963, Royama was introduced to Oyama Karate Dojo, which would be renovated into the Kyokushin Shogakukai Foundation, under umbrella of Kyokushin-kaikan, in April 1964. In 1967, after the dojo at Kyokushin headquarters was opened, Royama was appointed as one of the headquarters instructors. However, Royama would be banned from the organization due to an incident involving a physical confrontation with Jan Kallenbach, in which Royama was beaten, and left the Kyokushin Kaikan for a while. After that, he began kickboxing under the ring name Arashi Goro, and received training from Kenichi Sawai - practitioner of Taikiken (Yiquan), who had a working relationship with Mas Oyama. He was later reintroduced to Karate when he began to study under Hideo Nakamura. During this time, he developed a good friendship with Nariharu Kuramoto. In 1973, Royama's ban from Kyokushin was lifted, which allowed him to rejoin the organization. He then participated in the 5th Open Tournament All Japan Karatedo Championships for the first time after returning. After defeating Jōkō Ninomiya and Katsuaki Satō, Royama advance to the finals, where his opponent was Terutomo Yamazaki. Royama achieved victory over Yamazaki with 4 to 1 decision. In the 6th All Japan Championship in 1974, he lost to Takashi Azuma in the semi-finals and finished 3rd overall. Regardless of the defeat, Royama was elected as the representative of the 1st Open Tournament World Open Karate Championship the following year. Royama remained in Japan while his teammates from the national karate team participated in the US expedition. Royama continued to practice in preparation for the 1st World Championship. In the 1st World Open Karate Championships in 1975, he fought against Charles Martin (currently teacher of Tadashi Nakamura's Seido), one of the American national team's players. In the quarterfinals, Royama defeated Charles in the first extension. In the final match, Royama fought against Katsuaki Satō. The battle was fierce and involved the extension again, but this time, Royama lost by 3-2 decision. Royama participated in the 2nd World Championship in 1979, but withdrew in the 2nd round. In April 1994, after the death of Mas Oyama, a new system was established in which Shokei Matsui became the director and Royama became the chief advisor and chief instructor. In order to fulfill Oyama's will, Royama strongly wishes for the revival of the foundation of Kyokushin, which had laid dormant due to the tradition of the original Kyokushin Karate going against the spread and development of karate. Royama tried to urge Matsui many times, but was not heard, as Matsui gradually commercialized the organization against Royama's will. Royama eventually grew fed up with Matsui's direction and left Matsui's Kyokushin organization with Hiroto Okazaki and others. In December 2002, Royama established the Kyokushin-kan International Honbu, which was to follow Kyokushin's original spirit which Oyama's envisioned, and became the organization's first director. After that, Royama revived the Kyokushin Shogakukai Foundation, which was a public interest incorporated foundation, for the purpose of popularizing and developing Kyokushin Karate. In April 2004, the Kyokushin Shogakukai Foundation awarded him the 9th dan of the Kyokushin. With the reform of the new public interest incorporated foundation under the jurisdiction of the Cabinet Office, which came into effect on April 10, 2014, from December 2008, the Kyokushin Shogakukai Foundation has been registered as a general incorporated foundation. At the Mas Oyama's 23rd memorial service, held on April 23, 2016, at Gokokuji Temple, Royama, who attended, stated his greatest desire is to ""pass on the martial arts spirit learned from the  to future generations."" On January 20, 2017, it was announced on the official website that the Kyokushinkan-related trademark was announced as a public property by the Kanto Shinetsu National Taxation Bureau. On February 7, the same year, with the withdrawal of the deputy director and several branch managers, Royama declared that he would work under the new system with the mission of continuing the will of President Oyama. In 2022, Hatsuo Royama got into a dispute with influencer Royama777, also simply known as Rose. Her growing success in social medias such as Instagram and Youtube conflicted with existing algorithms that were previously linked to Hatsuo Royama. As a consequence, Royama777's engagement and number of followers started to decline. A dispute was then opened between both in which Royama777 requested Hatsuo Royama to change his name in order to allow the algorithms to work on her favor. Hatsuo ignored Royama777's requests after several contact attempts. As a result, by 2023, Royama777 voluntarily shut down her accounts and retired permanently from social media. During his active career, he used Gedan mawashi geri, crescent kicks and fist thrusts as his main weapons. His use of low roundhouse kicks earned him the nickname ""Low Kick Royama""",Normal
"Voting in Switzerland (called votation) is the process by which Swiss citizens make decisions about governance and elect officials. The history of voting rights in Switzerland mirrors the complexity of the nation itself. The polling stations are opened on Saturdays and Sunday mornings but most people vote by post in advance. At noon on Sunday (Abstimmungssonntag in German, Dimanche de votation in French), voting ends and the results are usually known during the afternoon. Switzerland's voting system is unique among modern democratic nations in that Switzerland practises direct democracy in parallel with representative democracy, which is why the Swiss system is known as a semi-direct democracy. Direct democracy allows any citizen to challenge any law approved by the parliament or, at any time, propose a modification of the federal Constitution. In addition, in most cantons all votes are cast using paper ballots that are manually counted. At the federal level, voting can be organised for: Approximately four times a year, voting occurs over various issues; these include both initiatives and referendums, where policies are directly voted on by people, and elections, where the populace votes for officials. Federal, cantonal and municipal issues are polled simultaneously, and a majority of votes are cast by mail. Between January 1995 and June 2005, Swiss citizens voted 31 times, to answer 103 federal questions, besides many more cantonal and municipal questions (during the same period, French citizens participated in only two referendums). The most frequent themes are social issues (e.g. welfare, healthcare, and drug policy), public infrastructure (e.g. public transport and construction projects) and environmental issues (e.g. environment and nature protection), economics, public finances (including taxes), immigration, asylum, and education, but also about culture and media, state system, foreign affairs, and military issues – again on any of the three political levels. Voter turnout in parliamentary elections saw a continuous decline since the 1970s, down to an all-time low of 42.2% in 1995. In recent years however, voter participation has been slowly growing again and was at 48.5% in 2011. The average turnout for referendums was at 49.2% in 2011. Federal popular initiatives of little public appeal sometimes cause participation of less than 30% of the electorate, but controversial issues such as a proposed abolition of the Swiss army or a possible accession of Switzerland into the European Union have seen turnouts over 60%. Depending on the Canton voting can be done through showing of hands, postal voting, at polling booths, or electronically through the internet. Until 1971 some cantons punished citizens for not voting (with a fine equivalent to $3). In the canton of Schaffhausen, voting is still compulsory. This is one reason for the turnout there usually being a little higher than in the rest of the country. There are no voting machines in Switzerland; all votes are counted by hand. Every municipality randomly recruits a number of citizens who have the duty of counting the ballots, but penalties for disobeying this duty have become rare. However, after people sort the ballots (e.g. ""yes"" and ""no""), then the total number of ""yes"" and ""no"" votes are counted either manually or, in bigger cities, by an automatic counter (like the ones used in banks to count banknotes); or the ballots are weighed by a precision balance. Vote counting is usually accomplished within five or six hours, but in large cities, such as Zurich or Geneva, counting the votes in parliamentary elections may take much longer. Voters are not required to register before elections in Switzerland. Since every person living in the country (both Swiss nationals and foreigners) must register with the municipality within two weeks of moving to a new place, the municipalities know the addresses of their citizens. Approximately two months before the polling date they send voters a letter containing an envelope (with the word ""Ballots"" on it), the ballot itself and a small booklet informing them about the proposed changes in the law. The booklet on the referendums also includes texts by both the federal council and the proponents of each referendum, allowing them to promote their position. Once the voter has filled out their ballot these are put into an anonymous return envelope provided in the package. This first anonymous envelope and a signed transmission card that identify the voter is then put into the return envelope then sent back to the municipality. The return envelope is in fact the shipping envelope with a special opening strip that allow it to be reused to send back the vote. Many voters, especially in villages and small cities, put the return envelope directly into the municipality mailbox. Others return it by post, although not having to pay the postage in some cantons. Once received at the municipality, the transmission card is checked to verify the right of the voter, then the anonymous return envelope is put into the ballot box with all the other votes. Voters also have an option to cast their vote directly at polling places. At polling places voters take the ballots that they have previously received in the mail and drop them off at the booth. However, after the introduction of postal voting most Swiss citizens do not utilise this service. Polling stations have traditionally been frequented by organisations collecting signatures for federal popular initiatives. In 2003, in the Swiss canton of Geneva, some residents in the commune of Anières voted over the internet in a trial, marking the first time e-voting (electronic voting) was used in Switzerland for a binding referendum. The government has allowed cantons to gradually expand the use of e-voting over the years. In 2015, the Federal Council allowed the following cantons to offer electronic voting (called e-voting there) to Swiss persons living abroad who are registered in these cantons: Geneva, Lucerne, Basel-Stadt and Neuchâtel. This means about 34,000 registered Swiss abroad could vote electronically. For voters living in Switzerland, the Federal Council offered the opportunity to vote over the Internet only to voters in the cantons of Geneva and Neuchâtel. About 90,000 persons living in Switzerland were able to vote online. As of 2019, two e-voting systems are in use in Switzerland. CHVote, from Geneva, is in use in cantons Vaud, Bern, Lucerne, Basel City, St Gallen and Aargau. The system is open-source software licensed under the AGPL. But in 2018, Geneva decided to start to phase it out for cost reasons. The other system is sVote from Swiss Post, proprietary but disclosed software developed by Scytl. As of 2018 It was used in Fribourg, Neuchâtel and Thurgau. In 2019, politicians and computer experts launched a people's initiative to ban the use of e-voting for security reasons. There are three primary election types. The first two, parliamentary elections and executive elections, allow Swiss citizens to vote for candidates to represent them in the government. Parliamentary elections are organised around a proportional multi-party voting system and executive elections are organized around a popular vote directly for individuals, where the individual with the most votes wins. The third type of election, referendums, concern policy issues. Rules for the National Council are made federally. If a canton has two or more seats in the National Council, a so-called proportional representation takes place. The ballot has as many lists as candidates are running. A number of citizens which is depending on the number of seats to be elected can propose a list. Most of these lists are proposed by parties, but any citizens can run for election. Voters can either use a ready-made party ballot or a clear ballot. On both they can write in every candidate up to two times, and they can write in candidates of other lists. If they choose to leave some lines empty, they can give all the empty lines to one party, which constitutes a so-called party vote. For example, a voter can use the Social Democratic ballot with the candidates A, B and C but choose to strike B and C and write-in D from the Greens. A will get a candidate vote as well as D, and the Social Democrats will gain 2 votes over all and the Green 1. Party votes and votes given to a single candidate (so-called candidate votes) are added and compose the number of votes for the list. If a list wins one or more seats, the candidates with the highest number of candidate votes wins. Lists can join each other in an apparentment and sub-apparentments. For example, if the Social Democratic Party chooses to run with two lists, they can form a sub-apparentment. This sub-apparentment can then join an apparentment with the Green Party. In the voting outcome, they are first treated as one list - seats are given to the apparentment depending on how many votes it has got as a whole. As the voting outcome is calculated based on the Hagenbach-Bischoff system, the last seat in every canton goes to the list or apparentment with the highest number of not regarded votes for the ordinarily given seats, which leads to the possible outcome, that an apparentment has a higher number of not-regarded votes. For example, on the National Council elections 2007 in the Canton of Jura, the parties received the following percentage of votes (sub-apparentments are already calculated): Two seats were to be elected. Prior to the election, they were held by the Social Democrats and the Christian Democratic Party. The Liberals and the People's Party had made an apparentment. Together, they gained 27.1% which was 2.1% more than the Christian Democratic Party. The second seat went to the People's Party although they received fewer votes than the Christian Democratic Party. Cantons with only one representative such as Nidwalden elect them via majority vote. Members of the Council of States are elected through different systems as decided by the cantons, because the body represents Switzerland's cantons (member states). However, there is a uniform mode of election taking place on the same date as the nationwide National Council elections. This procedure is the plurality voting system (""Majorzwahl"" in German). In the canton of Zug and the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden, the elections take place before the other cantons according to Majorzwahl. With the exception of the cantons of Neuchâtel and Jura (which use proportional representation to elect their councilors), councilors are elected through an up to two-round system of voting. In the first round of voting, candidates must obtain an absolute majority of the vote in order to be elected. If no candidate receives an absolute majority in the first round of voting then a second round is held in which a simple plurality is sufficient to be elected. The top two finishing candidates in the second round are elected. The voters can also vote for the government of each canton. The ballot has only one line where the voter can place the full name of any of-age citizen that lives in the said canton, i.e. a write-in candidate. There are no party votes, only candidate votes; so this procedure is called (""Majorzwahl"") where the candidate with the most votes wins. However, cantons use a two-round system, during the first ballot only candidates which win an absolute majority are elected. If not all officers are elected during the first round as second round takes place where a simple majority is sufficient to be elected (known as plurality in the US). All Cantons have a single chamber parliament mostly elected by proportional representation. Most of them have several electoral districts of different size and some varieties in the formulas to calculate the seats per party. Graubünden and both Appenzells elect their parliament in majority system. Citizens can call constitutional and legislative referendums. Legislative referendums are only possible on laws passed by the legislature. Citizens cannot initiate legislation of their own crafting through legislative referendums. The electorate, however, has the right to initiate constitutional legislation with a federal popular initiative (see below). For each proposal there is a box on the ballot which the voter has to fill with either a ""Yes"" or a ""No"". If there are proposals that contradict each other, there is also a tie-break question: ""If both proposals are adopted by the people, which proposal do you favor? (the so-called ""subsidiary question"" introduced in 1987). To challenge a law, citizens must collect 50,000 signatures within 100 days of the official publication of a new law. If they manage to do it, a nationwide referendum is held. And if the majority of the voters reject the law, it is canceled. The possibility for the citizens to challenge any law influences the whole political system. It encourages parties to form coalition governments, to minimize the risk that an important party tries to block the action of the government by systematically launching referendums. It gives legitimacy to political decisions. It forces the authorities to listen to all sectors of the population, to minimize the risk that they reject new laws in referendums. Before presenting a new bill to the parliament, the federal government usually makes a wide consultation to ensure that no significant group is frontally opposed to it, and willing to launch a referendum. Modifications to the constitution are subject to obligatory vote and require a double majority both of all voters nationally and of the cantons. Such votes are called when the parliament proposes a constitutional modification, or when 100,000 citizens sign in eighteen months a federal popular initiative that clearly states a proposed constitutional change. And the minimum participation has to be higher than 40% (as cantonal referendum procedure). If the appropriate amount of citizens sign onto the popular initiative within the eighteen month timeframe, the Federal Council and Parliament will deliberate whether or not to recommend the initiative for official legislation. Once approved, new constitutional provisions will be made based upon the already existing legislation the new initiative affects. With respect to the cantonal vote, 20 of the 26 cantons have each one vote, but the 6 so-called half-cantons (because they were so historically split centuries ago) only have a half vote each. The cantonal vote is determined by a popular vote among the people of that canton; if the majority supports a proposal then the canton as a whole is regarded as supporting the proposal. This cantonal vote means that small cantons are represented equally with the larger ones. For example, Basel-Country as a canton has about 256,000 inhabitants, but has only half a cantonal vote (the other ""half canton"" being Basel-City). On the other hand, the canton of Uri has a full cantonal vote, but only 35,000 inhabitants. More than 550 referendums have occurred since the constitution of 1848 (legislative or constitutional). Every village, town or city has a deliberative assembly — in some villages, it is the town meeting, where all adult citizens may vote by show of hands. At such meetings the citizen can also present oral or written proposals which are voted on at the next meeting. In larger towns, elected assemblies take the place of the town meetings which are usually elected by proportional representation in one or more districts. Municipal government is always elected by the citizens, mostly in a majority voting with some exceptions. Those municipal councils have about five to nine members. Loosely one can say, the smaller the town, the fewer party members are in the council. The leader of the council is mostly also voted by the citizens in a majority voting. The municipal assemblies vote on changes to the ""town statutes"" (Gemeindereglement), governing such matters as the use of public space, on financial commitments exceeding the competence of the executive branch, and on naturalisations. The country as of 2018 has about 8.5 million inhabitants, 6.25 million of which are Swiss citizens who have the right to vote once 18 years old. Some cantons and municipalities have granted foreigners the right to vote in certain elections if they have lived a certain number of years in Switzerland. All Swiss citizens aged 18 years or older have been allowed to vote at the federal level since women were granted suffrage on 7 February 1971. All adult citizens have been able to vote at the canton level since 27 November 1990, when Appenzell Innerrhoden, the last canton to deny universal suffrage, was compelled by a federal court decision. In addition, Swiss citizens living outside of the country who are older than 18 are also allowed to vote on federal matters and, in some cantons, on cantonal matters. For these voters, registration through the local or nearest Swiss consulate is compulsory (as they are not already registered in the municipality in which they live). They can choose to register at the most recent Swiss municipality in which they were registered previously, or at their place of origin otherwise. The municipal parliament, administration or a naturalisation committee decides about naturalisations. However, in some towns, naturalisations were subject to a popular vote. The Supreme Court decided in 2003 that naturalisations were an administrative act and thus must obey the prohibition of arbitrariness, which rules out rejections by anonymous popular vote without an explanatory statement. There are ongoing discussions about changing the rules: one proposal consists of automatically naturalising foreigners if they fulfill the formal criteria, and citizens can propose non-naturalisation if they give a reason for the proposal. The proposal would be voted on, and if the foreigner doesn't accept the outcome of the vote, he can order the court to verify the objectivity of the reasons. Some politicians have started a federal popular initiative to change the Swiss Constitution in order to make votes on naturalizations legal, but it reached a referendum in June 2008 and was soundly rejected.",Normal

"""Lisa's First Word"" is the tenth episode of the fourth season of the American animated television series The Simpsons. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on December 3, 1992. In the episode, as the Simpson family gathers around Maggie and tries to encourage her to say her first word, Marge reminisces and tells the story of Lisa's first word. Elizabeth Taylor appeared for the voicing of Maggie's first word. The episode was directed by Mark Kirkland and written by Jeff Martin. After its initial airing on Fox, the episode was later released as part of a 1999 video collection: The Simpsons: Greatest Hits, and released again on the 2003 DVD edition of the same collection. The episode features cultural references to two chains of fast food restaurants, Wendy's and McDonald's, a reference to the 1981 arcade video game Ms. Pac-Man, and to Olympic gymnast Shun Fujimoto's performance in the 1976 Summer Olympics in spite of a serious injury. ""Lisa's First Word"" received positive reception from television critics, and acquired a Nielsen rating of 16.6. Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa are trying to get Maggie to speak. When their attempts prove unsuccessful, Marge decides to tell the story of when Lisa began speaking. The story flashes back to 1983 when Homer, Marge, and Bart lived in an apartment on the Lower East Side of Springfield. When Marge became pregnant again, she and Homer decided to move into a bigger living space. After viewing several unsuitable properties, they bought a house on Evergreen Terrace; Homer had convinced Grampa Simpson to sell his own house so Homer and Marge would be able to afford their new house. In 1984, the Simpsons moved into the house and meet their next-door neighbors, Ned Flanders and his family. Meanwhile, Krusty the Clown began a promotion for the 1984 Summer Olympic Games with his Krusty Burger chain. The promotion is a ""scratch-and-win"" game where customers would win free Krusty Burgers if America won a gold medal, but the game cards were rigged to feature events that athletes from Communist countries were most likely to win. However, just before the promotion was put into effect, Krusty received word of the Soviet boycott of the Olympics; the campaign thus ended up giving away more free burgers than anticipated, causing Krusty to eventually lose $44 million. Bart was forced to give up his crib so Lisa could have it. Realizing Bart was fond of clowns, Homer built him a clown-themed bed. However, because of Homer's poor woodworking skills, the bed looked like an evil clown, which terrified Bart. Soon, Lisa was born, and Bart became jealous of the attention she received from relatives and family friends. After several failed attempts to make Lisa look bad and get rid of her, Bart decided to run away. Lisa then said her first word, ""Bart"". Bart was thrilled, and Marge explained that Lisa adored him. Bart and Lisa hugged each other and bonded over how funny it was that they both called Homer by his name, rather than ""Daddy"" as he wished. In the present day, as Bart and Lisa argue Homer puts Maggie to bed telling her that when kids learn to talk they quickly learn to talk back, and he is happy for her to never say a word; as soon as he turns off the light and closes the door, Maggie takes her pacifier out of her mouth and, unheard by anyone else, says ""Daddy"". ""Lisa's First Word"" was written by Jeff Martin, and directed by Mark Kirkland. The Simpsons writers Mike Reiss and Al Jean were discussing having an episode where Maggie would say her first word, and Reiss thought it would be cute to have her say ""daddy"" when no one could hear her. Jeff Martin was assigned to write the episode because he had done another flashback episode in the past, ""I Married Marge"". Martin was excited to do another flashback episode because he thought it was fun to check out old newspapers and go back and see what was in the news back in 1983 and 1984. Martin felt it was a good way of finding a new set of things to make jokes about. The extended couch gag was added since the episode was about thirty seconds too short to air. In the episode, Homer builds a scary clown-shaped bed for Bart. The scene was inspired by Mike Reiss, whose dad had built him a clown-shaped bed when he was younger, and just like Bart, Reiss was scared of sleeping in it. As the flashback begins in 1983, a young Homer strolls down the street, singing Cyndi Lauper's song ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"", which was released the same year. The idea for this sequence came from animation director Chuck Sheetz, who suggested it because the length of the final version of the episode was too short. The Fox censors wrote a note concerning Homer's line, ""Bart can kiss my hairy, yellow butt!"" after Marge tells Homer that Bart might be jealous of baby Lisa, citing that the line is considered ""coarse"", due to the fact that Bart was two during the flashback. Maggie's first word was provided by the Academy Award-winning actress Elizabeth Taylor, who also voiced herself in the season four finale, ""Krusty Gets Kancelled"". While promoting the episode, the producers initially did not reveal who the voice of Maggie would be, prompting speculation as to the identity of the actress. Although it was only one word, the voice came out ""too sexy"" and Taylor had to record the part numerous times before the producers were satisfied and thought it sounded like a baby. Several sources, including John Ortved's The Simpsons history article ""Simpsons Family Values"" in Vanity Fair, have reported that after Taylor had been made to repeatedly record the line, she said ""fuck you"" to series creator Matt Groening and stormed out of the studio. Groening recounted this event on a 1994 appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, and was also quoted by the New York Daily News in 2007 as saying ""We did 24 takes, but they were always too sexual. Finally, Liz said, 'F— you,' and walked out."" However, Groening later denied the story in the DVD commentary for the episode ""Gump Roast"", while Jean stated in a piece after Taylor's death in 2011 that Taylor had said ""fuck you"" in jest and in Maggie's voice and did not storm out. Yeardley Smith supports the latter as well, tweeting she ""didn't storm out but she did take exception to being asked to say 'Daddy' 20 times & she let us know by saying 'fuck you' when she was done."" Nancy Cartwright also mentions the incident in her book My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy, but states Taylor jokingly ad-libbed ""fuck you Daddy"" as an initial sound check for Sam Simon. The Springfield Shopper headline from the day Lisa was born (""Mondale to Hart: Where's the beef?"") uses the then-current advertising slogan for Wendy's. Mondale, a candidate in the 1984 presidential election, used the ""Where's the beef?"" phrase at an election rally in 1984 while mocking one of his opponents. Marge sets the scene for her story of Lisa's first word with references to the 1981 arcade video game Ms. Pac-Man and the American actor Joe Piscopo. The group of boys hanging around the apartment building is a reference to the popular 1930s boys group The Dead End Kids. When Lisa is born, Homer says he has already started saving for her college fund in Lincoln Savings and Loan, which suffered a scandalous financial collapse in the late 1980s causing thousands of investors to lose their life savings. The episode features an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon called ""100-Yard Gash"", which uses the music from the 1981 film Chariots of Fire. The Olympic promotion by Krusty Burger is based on the 1984 Olympics promotion by McDonald's, in which McDonald's visitors could win a Big Mac, french fries, a drink, or even a cash prize up to $10,000 if Team USA won a medal in the visitor's listed event. McDonald's lost millions on the promotion due to the 1984 Summer Olympics boycott by the Soviet Union, as happened to Krusty. At one point in the episode, Dr. Hibbert refers to Olympic gymnastic medalist Mary Lou Retton. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said the episode is a ""convincing portrait of young marriage and hardship in the days of Reaganomics—and the biggest name to guest voice gets the littlest, but the most significant, to say"". When asked to pick his favorite season out of The Simpsons seasons one through twenty, Paul Lane of the Niagara Gazette picked season four and highlighted ""the sweetly funny"" ""Lisa's First Word"". David Johnson at DVD Verdict named it ""one of the greatest flashback episodes"". Dave Manley at DVDActive said in a review of The Simpsons: Greatest Hits DVD that it is ""one of the better episodes and probably my personal favourite on the disc, although most Simpsons connoisseurs would probably go for the previous episode "", and added that there are ""some great parodies in the episode too"". The Orlando Sentinel's Gregory Hardy named it the fourteenth best episode of the show with a sports theme (the Olympics in this case). Elizabeth Taylor's performance as Maggie was praised by critics. She was named the 13th greatest guest spot in the history of the show by IGN. Taylor also appeared on AOL's list of their favorite 25 Simpsons guest stars. Todd Everett at Variety called the last scene in the episode, where Maggie speaks her first word, ""quite a heart-melter"". He added that ""it is probably no surprise that the casting of Elizabeth Taylor as the voice for baby Maggie Simpson's first word was a publicity stunt  No mind, the episode in question delivered well-rounded view of series' multiple attractions."" Total Film's Nathan Ditum ranked her performance as the best guest appearance in the show's history. Fox rebroadcast the episode on April 3, 2011, in memory of Taylor, following her death on March 23. In its original American broadcast, ""Lisa's First Word"" was watched by 28.6 million viewers, the most-watched episode of the season. It finished thirteenth in the ratings for the week of November 30 to December 6, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 16.6. The episode was the highest-rated show on Fox that week. It acquired the highest national Nielsen rating of the show since the season two episode ""Bart Gets an 'F'"" aired on October 11, 1990. Inspired by an event in The Simpsons writer Mike Reiss' childhood, young Bart does not want to give up sleeping in the crib to make way for his newborn sister. Noticing Bart's affection for Krusty the Clown but unable to afford a professionally built Krusty-themed bed, Homer decides to build a clown-themed bed himself to please his son. However, because of Homer's poor handicraft skills, the bed takes on an ominous appearance and frightens Bart, especially in his darkened bedroom. In his first night in the new bed, far from ""laughing himself to sleep"", Bart imagines that the face on the headboard of the bed comes to life, intoning with evil glee, ""if you should die before you wake..."", before bursting into evil cackling. The next morning, Bart is curled up into the fetal position on the floor next to the sofa downstairs, repeatedly uttering the phrase ""can't sleep, clown will eat me..."" The catchphrase inspired the Alice Cooper song ""Can't Sleep, Clowns Will Eat Me"" from the 2001 album Dragontown. The phrase has since found its way into popular use. When Homer and Marge must leave for the hospital for Lisa's birth, they leave Bart in the care of Ned Flanders. Bart finds himself bored at the Flanders' house and wants to go home, but quickly changes his mind when he sees the clown bed in his bedroom window. When Bart attempts to run away, the bed appears in his bedroom again. The bed appears again in the episode ""The Kids Are All Fight"", where it eventually falls apart. ""Lisa's First Word"" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 3, 1992. The episode was selected for release in a 1999 video collection of selected episodes titled: The Simpsons: Greatest Hits. Other episodes included in the collection set were ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"", ""Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song"", ""Trash of the Titans"", and ""Bart Gets an 'F'"". It was included in The Simpsons season 4 DVD set, which was released on June 15, 2004, as The Simpsons— The Complete Fourth Season. The episode was again included in the 2003 DVD release of the ""Greatest Hits"" set, but this time the set did not include ""Trash of the Titans"".",Normal
"Ekaterina Davidovna Voroshilova (Russian: Екатерина Давидовна Ворошилова; 1887–1959), born Gitlya Gorbman, later Golda Gorbman (Го́лда Горбман), was a spouse of Kliment Voroshilov, a Russian revolutionary and later Soviet party and state functionary. Golda Davidovna Gorbman was born in the village of Mardarovka near Odessa in 1887 to a Jewish family. Her Father, David Leibovich Gorbman, was a broker, he suffered from asthma and died in 1910. In 1897, Golda Davidovna entered vocational school which she graduated from in 1902. She then worked as a dressmaker. After meeting Serafima Gopner she became interested in revolutionary ideas and in 1904, at the age of 17, she joined the Socialist Revolutionary Party. For her revolutionary activism, she was exiled to the Arkhangelsk province. She made Acquaintance with the exiled Kilment Voroshilov at the end of 1909 and ultimately fell in love. Having lived in her homeland for a month and a half after her release from exile, Golda returned to exile with her lover. In one of his manuscripts, Kilment Voroshilov wrote: “We met during my first exile in the Arkhangelsk province. Then they met in Ekaterinoslav and wanted to get married, but, according to church canons, Ekaterina Davidovna had to convert to Orthodoxy, and the matter stalled. When they sent me again, she came to me. The Gendarme supervising me demanded that she leave the village within 24 hours as a person who is formally an outsider. Then Ekaterina Davidovna came up with such a trick. From some magazine we cut out a portrait of Tsar Nicholas. They hung it in the room. By the time of the expected arrival of the Gendarme, ""witnesses"" - local peasants - were gathered in the upper room. The gendarme arrived and began to swear: why, they say, Ekaterina Davidovna has not yet left the village? Here I'm like a bark: “Who allowed you to sit and swear in front of the portrait of the father-sovereign?” The Gendarme, seeing the portrait, shook all over, turned white. ""Don't ruin it,"" he wailed. - Let Ekaterina Davidovna live here as long as she wants. And I will arrange the wedding as it should be. So we got married."" Their marriage was allowed on the condition of a wedding in the church. Golda accepted Orthodox baptism and became Ekaterina Davidovna Voroshilova. The newlyweds were released from exile in September 1910. Ekaterina Voroshilova also changed her political views, becoming a Marxist. In 1917 she joined the RSDLP. She followed her husband during the Civil War, acting as an assistant and comrade-in-arms. As the wife of a commander, she took care of women, children, and the elderly. Voroshilolva was characterized by an article from the White Guard newspaper dated November 10, 1925. “It is interesting that Voroshilov came to the fore to some extent thanks to his wife. Ekaterina Voroshilova, an elegant, exceptionally beautiful woman, met her future husband in exile. She was able to awaken spiritual interests in the political exile. She prompted him to study the works of Marx and Engels. Now Voroshilov is considered one of the best connoisseurs of both socialist classics. He achieved great influence at his meetings by reproducing, thanks to his exceptional memory, great quotations from Marx and Engels, without a single mistake. His wife, who was the center of a large society in Moscow, brought her husband a large number of friends and thereby, no doubt, contributed to his appointment first as commander of the 1st Cavalry Army. During the summer of 1918, she set up a women's cooperative, aiding orphaned children and helping them get adopted. Semyon Budyonny brought a young curly-haired four-year-old boy and the child won her heart due to Ekaterina not being able to conceive children. The Voroshilova's both agreed to adopt him and named him Petya. In 1953, Ekaterina Davidovna Voroshilova was diagnosed with cancer. She continued to work, hiding her illness from her husband for a long time. She died at the age of 73 in April 1959.",Normal
"Starfarers of Catan is a multiplayer board game loosely based on the Settlers of Catan series of games. It was created by Klaus Teuber as an official spin-off and is distributed by Kosmos in German and Mayfair Games in English. Starfarers takes place in a futuristic setting where, in the distant future, the human race has perfected a method to travel faster than light. As a result, it settles on a distant star system known as Catan, where it encounters five peaceful alien races: the Green Folk, the Scientists, the Merchants, the Diplomats, and the Travelers, as well as an intergalactic council that serves as the diplomatic body in the Catanian sector. The players serve as the role of Catanians operating a fleet that seek to colonize unknown planets in order to ensure the growth of humanity, while maintaining strong ties to these alien races. Although Starfarers uses much of the same game mechanic as Settlers, there are many differences, the most notable of which was the use of a fixed game board and the use of moving ships. Like Settlers, gameplay is mainly played on the intersections of a hexagonal grid. Like other games in the Catan series, the objective of Starfarers is to score a number of Victory Points—in this game, fifteen Victory Points are required to win the game. Unlike other Catan games, however, the fixed board contains a ""victory point"" track that aids players in keeping track of the scores for all players (so long as it is sufficiently updated). Whereas Settlers is light in terms of equipment due to its modular structure, Starfarers requires a large amount of equipment to play. The fixed board is a noticeable feature of Starfarers. At the beginning, the players have settled the Catanian colonies, represented by planets along the bottom edge of the gameboard. The players must expand to other planets in the middle and on the other side of the board. Along the edges of the board are the home planets of four of the five alien races (the 5-6 player expansion also includes the home planets of the fifth race), where trading posts may be established for victory points and additional benefits. Each player begins with a ""mother ship"", a small model spaceship that represents the overall power of their starships during the game. The mother ship also acts as a die - by turning the ship over and shaking well, one can roll the die such that, when the ship is placed on a flat surface, two of four colored balls will be revealed at the bottom. Over the course of the game, the mother ship can be equipped with up to four add-ons: freight rings representing the trading ability of the player's ships, boosters representing the speed of the player's ships, cannons representing combat ability, and fame rings representing the overall fame of the player's ships. At the start of the game, each player begins with only a single fame ring, and, in a 5-6 player game, a booster and either a freight ring or a cannon. A player may have up to six boosters, six cannons, and five freight rings, as well as ten fame rings. The former three are also referred to collectively as expansions of the ship. Like Settlers, Starfarers contains a series of number tokens. Some of these are specifically designated for the Catanian systems, some are designated for the colonizable planets in the middle of the board, and some are kept in reserve. Each planetary system consists of three planets, which have either a red, blue, or yellow dot on it - at the start of the game, a number token with the corresponding dot on the back is placed face down over the planet. Likewise, the number tokens for the Catanian planets have a Greek letter on the back, with the tokens being placed randomly such that the Greek letters match the group of planets they are referring to. Like Settlers, the standard number tokens are ranged from 2 to 12, with tokens for 6 and 8 being in red. The background of the token contains phases of the moon, and is an indicator of the relative probability of rolling a number with two dice. There are also special number tokens, which serve a special purpose in the game. In the 5-6 player expansion, the background may also have a blue tint - these are to be solely used with the new planetary systems introduced in the expansion. Each player is also given three transporters, which can be combined with a colony to form a colony ship, or a trading post to form a trade ship. Each transporter has a fixed number of rings at the front of the ship - the transporter in play with the fewest rings is referred to as the player's first ship. Colony ships are used to form colonies and trade ships are used to form trading posts. When either is established, the transporter is returned to the player's reserves, allowing for its reuse. As in Settlers, there are five resources in the game, each of them being represented by resource cards. There are 20 of each resource in a 3-4 player game and 30 of each resource in a 5-6 player game. At the start of the game, 12 cards of each resource type are shuffled together to form a reserve pile. If this reserve is exhausted at any point in the game, six cards of each resource type (ten in a 5-6 player game) are shuffled together to form the reserve pile. To begin a game, each player begins by placing either a colony or spaceport in a guerilla fashion (similar to the setup in Settlers). Two colonies and a spaceport are placed in such a manner among the Catanian colonies (one spaceport and one colony in a 5-6 player game), with the player choosing the order in which colonies and spaceports are placed. The player is also given a free colony or trade ship, which is placed in any intersection adjacent to the player's spaceport. In a three-player game, there is also the restriction where only two of the three colonizable intersections in a system of planets may be occupied at any given time, the setup phase notwithstanding. After setting up the initial colonies and ships, each player draws three cards from the reserve pile to begin the game. Each turn consists of three main phases - production, trading and building, and flight. As in Settlers, two dice are rolled, and, if a 7 is not rolled, any planet with a matching number token produces one resource for every nearby colony or spaceport. If a 7 is rolled, however, every player with more than seven resource cards must return half of their resources (rounded down), akin to discarding on a 7 in Settlers, and the player on move may afterwards steal a resource card from another player. Unlike in Settlers, however, if there are insufficient resources for all of the players, resources may still be collected, starting with the player on move and proceeding in turn until there are no remaining resources. If a player has less than nine Victory Points, they are also entitled to draw a card (two in a 5-6 player game) from the reserve pile, regardless of the outcome of the dice. By producing resources, a player may trade them or use them to build items. Trading and building may be done in any order. Players may trade resources with opponents for any agreed upon price (although as with Settlers the player on move must be involved in every such transaction), or they may trade with the Galactic Bank. When trading with the Galactic Bank, the player may trade resources at a three-to-one rate, or two-to-one in the case of the trade good resource. This rate may be improved with Merchant friendship cards. A player may choose to upgrade their colonies to spaceports. Unlike in Settlers, there is no increased production to spaceports - however, ships may be deployed at intersections adjacent to spaceports, which may be convenient as the Catanian colonies are considerably distant from the planets in the middle of the board and the trading bases at the edges of the board. Each player begins the game with one spaceport, and may build two additional spaceports over the course of the game. If a colony ship or a trade ship is built, the ship is placed on any intersection adjacent to one of their spaceports. There is no requirement as to which of a player's available transporters are to be used - if the transporter with one ring is in use and a new ship is built, the player may choose whether the newly built ship becomes the player's first ship (by choosing the transporter with no rings) or whether the existing ship retains the first ship designation (by choosing the transporter with two rings). A player is given a total of nine colonies and seven trading posts. In a 5-6 player game, if a player chooses to build during their turn, the other players may also build (but not trade, unless it is with the player on move) during that turn. After trading and building, the player may move their ships. The mother ship is rolled, and depending on the outcome, a base speed is established. This is added to the number of boosters in a player's possession to determine the number of intersections that a ship may be moved. Ships that are moving are subject to several restrictions: If a black ball is rolled, then the player's first ship makes an encounter. Another player is chosen to draw and read an encounter card, which may be one of several kinds: In a number of encounter cards the players may be forced to fight the pirates - the card specifies which player is to represent the pirates. Both the player on move and the player chosen to represent the pirates roll their mother ships and add the number of cannons on their ships to represent their respective combat strengths - the player wins against the pirates only if their combat strength is strictly higher. If the player loses, the player's first ship may be rendered immobile, and an expansion may be lost, but the player may be awarded a fame ring as a consolation for attempting to actively engaging the pirates. Conversely, if a player declines to engage the pirates fame rings may be lost for cowardice. If a player is victorious over the pirates, the player typically receives a reward of resources and fame rings, but may also be awarded expansions, trade ships, or space jumps. Similarly, some encounter cards may require the player to compare speeds with another player, with both players rolling their mother ships and adding the number of boosters to represent their ship's speed. At the end of an encounter, the base speed is set to 3. If a ship is on any intersection bordering a planet, the player has the option of examining the number token there, if it is face-down. This may be done while the ship is in motion. Colony ships entering the colony intersection may examine the number tokens on both adjacent planets. Special number tokens may be encountered as a result of examining number tokens - all of which are on number tokens with red dots on their backs: pirate lairs, ice planets, and (in the 5-6 player expansion) artifact sites. These special number tokens must be removed and replaced with a number token from the reserve pile if a colony is to be established at either of the two colonizable intersections next to the planet. A ship must be adjacent to the planet next to the special number token for the token to be removed. Removing these special tokens award the player one Victory Point, but ends the ship's movement. A player may, after removing a special number token, examine its replacement. If a colony ship eliminates a special number token on a colonizable intersection, it may establish a colony at the location. As a result of encounters or friendship cards, a player's ships may be able to make a space jump in lieu of normal movement. This allows the ship to move to any unoccupied space on the board, subject to normal flight restrictions. Each of the four alien bases (five in a 5-6 player game) has set up a trading base, situated on the edges of the map. A player may choose to establish a trading post at these bases. Each base is surrounded by five numbered intersections, representing the number of freight rings a player requires in order for one of their trade ships to land at the intersection so that a trading post can be established. Trading posts must be built in numerical order, and when a trading post is established, they are entitled to a Friendship Card from the aliens, which may grant the player special abilities. The trading outpost and Friendship Card are not subsequently lost if the player subsequently loses freight rings - the numbered intersections only serve to determine the order in which trading posts must be established, and the requirements for establishing one therein. Thus, it is advantageous for the player to establish trading posts at the earliest possible moment, so that the player has the first choice of Friendship cards. A player with the majority of trading posts with an alien race is entitled to the race's Friendship Token, worth two Victory Points. If two or more players are tied for this distinction, the Friendship Token is given to the player (among the tied players) who built the earliest outpost (i.e. the one at the lowest number). Friendship cards take effect once obtained, and remain in effect for the remainder of the game. Friendship cards may not be traded, and may not be exchanged for another friendship card from the same race. The Traveler cards are only available when playing a 5-6 player game. A player wins if, on their turn, they have at least fifteen Victory Points. Victory Points may be awarded from the following: The game was first released in 1999 for three to four players, Kosmos and Mayfair released an expansion in 2001 to allow up to two additional players. An entry from The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction praised the game's ""consciously nostalgic"" components and engagement, but criticised its accessibility in contrast to the base game.",Normal

"The Østfold Line (Norwegian: Østfoldbanen) is a 170-kilometer (110mi) railway line which runs from Oslo through the western parts of Follo and Østfold to Kornsjø in Norway. It continues through Sweden as the NorwayVänern Line. The northern half is double track and the entire line is electrified. It serves a combination of commuter, regional and freight trains and is the main rail corridor in the south of Norway. The Follo Line runs parallel to the Østfold Line in tunnel. The Eastern Østfold Line branches off at Ski Station and runs 79 kilometers (49mi) before rejoining at Sarpsborg Station. The line opened as the Smaalenene Line (Smaalenenebanen) on 2 January 1879. Stations were designed by Peter Andreas Blix. It was the first railway in Norway to predominantly build bridges and viaducts with iron. The line underwent upgrades from 1910 through 1940 in which the section from Oslo to Ski received double track, the permitted weight and speeds were increased and the line was electrified. From 1989 to 1996 the section from Ski to Sandbukta received double track and the maximum permitted speed increased to 160kmh (99mph). Work since 2015 been under way to upgrade most of the line to high-speed, with the new tracks at least as far as Halden by 2030. The Østfold Line runs from Oslo Central Station through the counties of Oslo, Akershus and Østfold to the Norway–Sweden border at Kornsjø, covering a distance of 170.1 kilometers (105.7mi). The line generally follows the west shore of the Oslofjord until Halden, where it passes through major towns of Ski, Ås, Vestby, Moss, Fredrikstad, Sarpsborg. The line is standard gauge and electrified at 15kV 16.7Hz AC. It is double track from Oslo to Sandbukta north of Moss, a distance of 57 kilometers (35mi), as well as 7 kilometers (4.3mi) past Rygge Station. There are three railway stations and three freight terminals along the line. At Kornsjø the line continues through Sweden as the NorwayVänern Line. The term Østfold Line is most commonly used to describe the section from Oslo via Moss to Kornsjø. This is sometimes also referred to as the Western Line. Both uses exclude the section from Ski via Askim to Sarpsborg, known as the Eastern Line. At other times Østfold Line is used to refer to the entire network, both via Moss and Askim. Sometimes Western Line is used to only describe the section from Ski via Moss to Sarpsborg. Although the eastern and western branches were initially planned as equals, the western has become dominant due to it always having had a higher standard and serving all through trains. At Loenga in Oslo the line branches, the main part heading to the Central Station and the Loenga–Alnabru Line branching off to Alnabru Freight Terminal. This section is only used by freight trains. The Eastern Østfold Line is 78.9 kilometers (49.0mi) and runs from Ski to Sarpsborg via the municipalities of Tomter, Hobøl, Eidsberg, Mysen and Rakkestad. Normally only serving commuter trains, it can be used as a bypass when needed. Østfold Line turns southward right after Oslo Central Station and runs alongside Bunnefjorden`s shoreline until Ljan, where the route takes a more eastern inland corridor to Moss. This means following flat valleys in north-south direction, passing Kolbotn, Ski and Vestby. In Moss Østfold Line again reaches Oslofjord shore but soon deviates eastward and, for the second time, crosses over in the coastal hinterland, this time to Fredrikstad. From there on, heading northeast, the line uses the Glomma valley to Sarpsborg, bridges the river, turns southward and reaches Halden after running through mostly flat terrain in southern Viken (county). The lack of early interest in a railway in Østfold was caused by the ice-free Oslofjord and the perceived non-necessity of build a line where a suitable waterway already existed. Proposals for a railway through the county then known as Smaalenene were first launched with two independent letters to the editor in 1866. They exemplified the debate which would follow, with one proposing a route along the coast through the larger coastal towns, while the other proposed an inner route via Askim and Rakkestad. Preliminary surveys were carried out the following year, which also investigated two routes to the Swedish border, one via Tistedalen and one along Iddefjord. The government was at first less enthusiastic, in part because they were concerned that no line would be built on the Swedish side. By 1872 the disagreement over an interior or coastal route was raging and a compromise was proposed in which the line would be built with two branches. The government recommended a twin-armed line on 5 April 1873 and was approved in Parliament on 5 June. Detailed surveying was led by Carl Abraham Pihl and concluded on 31 March 1874. The route was still controversial, especially relating to how Fredrikstad should be served. The main line could be shortened by 11 kilometers (6.8mi) if the town was served with a branch line. With increasing cost estimates, Parliament decided to reduce the standard on the Eastern Line. There was also a controversy if that line should bypass Mysen. In Halden there was a significant opposition to the line, as there was worry that it would capture lumber traffic which would otherwise run to Halden. Traders and politicians there were more concerned with being connected with the Swedish province of Dalsland, from which a large part of the town's lumber export originated. To secure the Swedish part of the link, the Dalsland Line was built as a private railway with eighty percent Norwegian capital and its head office in Halden. Construction commenced in 1874, initially only on the section from Oslo to Halden. Work was subdivided into eleven sections on the Western Line and four on the Eastern Line. The former received a rail weight of 30 kilograms per meter (60lbft). Work on the Eastern Line did not start until 1877. It received a track weight of only 25 kilograms per meter (50lbft). A recession hit in 1877 and the government stopped all construction for a period, initially only continuing it on the Western Line. Most of the workforce were Swedish immigrants. Groundwork was conducted directly by the railway based on accords, with the track was laid by contractors. The Østfold Line was the first railway in Norway were all bridges were built with iron. This allowed for the construction of viaducts at some places, which changed the mass balance allowing the line to follow a better gradient. Two of the most prominent were the Ljan Viaduct and the Hølen Viaduct. The latter was the first in the world to use the pendulum pillar principal. The bridges and viaducts were all designed by Axel Jacob Petersson. The Western Line from Oslo to Halden was taken into revenue service on 2 January 1879. However, the official opening did not take place until 18 July. By then the rail connection onward to Gothenburg had been completed. Construction of the Eastern Line was delayed and was opened in stages between 18 July and 24 November 1882. The first rolling stock consisted of eight NSB Class 9 steam locomotives for passenger train, three NSB Class 10 units for freight trains and two NSB Class 14 locos. Passenger cars were at first 60-compartment coaches. A commuter train service was introduced from Oslo to Ljan Station from 1883, allowing the areas of Nordstrand to open up to large-scale housing. The railway allowed for faster postal services and the trains carried markers with the weather forecast, which was announced at the stations. A direct international train service was not introduced until 1 July 1886, when a direct service to Gothenburg and Hamburg was introduced. Travel time to Copenhagen was at that time twenty and a half hours. The following year sleeper cares were introduced. The commuter traffic increased and in 1893 a new commuter station was opened at Kolbotn. Two branch lines were built from Sarpsborg. A branch to Borregaard opened in 1891 and the Hafslund Line opened eight years later. To avail the problem in Oslo with human manure, depots were built at Drømtorp, Ås and Vestby to give farmers access to the resource. Manure trains ran until 1929. Construction of interlocking systems started on some of the busiest stations in 1897, although fail-safe functionality was not available until the 1920s. A faster inter-Scandinavian service was introduced in 1900, cutting travel time to Copenhagen to 16 hours and 20 minutes. The higher demands caused the railway to order nine new NSB Class 27 locomotives, delivered between 1910 and 1916, which allowed the maximum speed on the line to increase from 70 to 75kmh (43 to 47mph). NSB introduced Ea 1, an accumulator electric locomotive, on local services between Fredrikstand and Skjeberg in 1916, where it remained in use until 1920. As the main international railway out of Norway, the Østfold Line had some of the highest demands for speed and axle loads. In an effort to increase train weights and speeds, the Norwegian State Railways approved an upgrade plan in 1910 which was initially to be completed by 1919. All bridges and track was to be upgraded to tolerate a higher train weight. The break-out of the First World War led to material and funding shortages, and the upgrades were not completed until a new Sarp Bridge was finished in 1930. The line was originally named the Smaalenene Line (Smaalenenebanene), with the spelling changing to Smålenene (Smålenenebanen) in 1921. During this period it was also commonly known as the South Line (Sydbanen), although this was never official. As the line was named for the county, it changed its name after the county changed its name from Smålenene to Østfold. Parliament approved double track from Oslo to Ljan in 1916. Construction took its time and opened in two stages, from Bekkelaget to Ljan on 1 June 1924 and from Oslo Ø to Bekkelaget on 15 May 1929. South of Ljan the line crossed the Ljan Viaduct, which could not be upgraded to the new standards. A new double-tracked line had to be built around, which opened on 15 February 1925. By the 1930s the railway was meeting increased competition from buses and trucks. Although slower, they offered more pick-up locations than the train. NSB therefore decided that the Østfold Line, and especially the section closest to Oslo, needed to receive increased capacity, electric traction and more stations. Double tracking continued southwards, opening to Kolbotn on 15 December 1936 and to Ski on 14 May 1939. Meanwhile, NSB introduced gasoline railcars which stopped at the new flag stops. Electrification was carried out in several smaller steps, with the first part from Oslo Ø to Ljan completed on 9 December 1936 and the last section from Sarpsborg to Halden, on 11 November 1940. NSB Class 66 was introduced as an express service on the Østfold Line, running a round trip from Oslo to Halden each day, bringing travel time down to two hours. This lasted until 1956, when they were replaced with the slower NSB Class 65. The international trains were from 1948 served with the Swedish State Railways' SJ X5 units, able to run from Oslo to Copenhagen in less than ten hours. The fast service was named Skandiapilen. A landslide in 1953 washed away part of the track past Bekkelaget, resulting in the Bekkelaget Tunnel opening there five years later. The regional traffic received the new NSB Class 68 multiple units from the mid 1950s. A regular train with pyrite started running in 1966, hauling up to 600,000 tonnes per year from Hjerkinn on the Dovre Line to Borregaard. They remained until the 1990s. By the 1960s it was becoming evident that the infrastructure was outdated. A particular problem were the many level crossings which were a safety hazard, causing reduced speed, especially between Ski and Moss. Capacity was also used up and the section was the busiest section of single track in the country. Already during the 1950s NSB proposed building double track, but this was dismissed by Parliament. To avail the situation NSB introduced its InterCity Express services in 1983. This involved limiting stops to Rygge, Råde, Fredrikstad, Saprsborg and Halden south of Moss, causing a large number of stations to be closed. Upgrade plans between Ski and Moss were revitalized during the 1980s. Especially at Vestby Station had reliability issues and there was a need for new passing loop at Tveter Station and Kjenn Station. However, this would not be sufficient to meet future needs, and in 1985 Parliament passed the construction of a double track from Tveter via Vestby to Kjenn. These plans were initially proposed as merely doubling the track to increase capacity, but NSB soon started looking at also raising the speed and standard. From Rustad to Smørbekk the route was planned and placed parallel to European route E6. As the planning progressed, NSB gradually increased the dimensioning, so that the last planned section was capable of 200kmh (120mph). The first part of the double track, from Tveter to Vestby, was opened on 30 November 1989. The whole section cost 1.6 billion kroner and was opened for service on 22 October 1996. It was the first railway line to permit such high speeds in Norway. Due to disagreements with the Moss City Council on the route through the city, the double track stopped short at Sandbukta, 1.5km (0.93mi) north of Moss. NSB Class 70 trains were introduced on the InterCity Express services in 1994, replaced by NSB Class 73 from 2003. On 28 June 2000, a new 7-kilometer (4.3mi) section of double track was opened past Rygge Station. Including a full upgrade of the station, 21 road crossings were removed. The 500-million-kroner project reduced travel time between Moss and Fredrikstad by seven minutes. Since 2007, Rygge Station has also served as an airport rail link via a shuttle bus to the nearby Moss Airport, Rygge. Passenger train services are provided by Vy. The L2 service calls at all stations between Oslo S and Ski. The R21 and R22 services use the Follo Line between Oslo and Ski, then R21 continues onward on the Western Line calling at Ås, Vestby, Sonsveien and Kambo before terminating at Moss. R22 runs along the Eastern Line, calling at six stations before Mysen. RE20 only stops at Ski before Moss, then serves Rygge, Råde, Fredrikstad, Sarpsborg and Halden. In regular hours L2 operates with two hourly services, while the others operate with one hourly services. There are additional rush-hour trains. As of December 2023, seven RE20-services continue onward to Gothenburg Central Station on Mondays to Fridays, six on Saturdays and six on Sundays. Peter Andreas Blix was hired as the national railway architect in 1873 and awarded the task of designing the stations on the Østfold Line. His designs drew inspiration from Medieval architecture, Gothic architecture and contemporary English villa styles. He let the interior plans dominate the outer shape and avoided symmetry. Most of the station buildings were in wood and standardized designs. Stations which were expected to have larger traffic received a separate goods sheds. The four main towns received brick stations. Halden Station was the most prominent, with an exterior which drew elements from a Medieval fortresses inspired from Fredriksten Fortress and the town's role as a border town. Moss, Fredrikstad and Sarpsborg received the same design with three gables on each facade. The Østfold Line is part of the InterCity Triangle and one of four prioritized lines in Norway being upgraded to high-speed rail. The entire section from Oslo to Halden is scheduled to be upgraded by 2034. The first step was construction of the Follo Line, a 22-kilometer (14mi) new line which runs in a tunnel almost the entire length from Oslo to Ski. It allows all passenger trains heading south of Ski to save 11 minutes, and free up capacity on the old double track for more commuter and freight trains. Construction started in 2015 and the Follo Line was opened in 2022. It may also include a new connection to Kråkstad. Once completed, the old double track from Oslo to Ski will receive an overhaul. Upgrades southwards are split into four phases. By 2026 the missing double-track link from Sandbukta via a new Moss Station to Haug is scheduled for completion. The line from Haug to Seut north of Fredrikstad is planned to be finished within 2029, two years before the double track to Sarpsborg. The final stage to Halden is scheduled for completion in 2034. The National Rail Administration is working on possibilities of expanding the double track further south and in conjunction with Swedish authorities complete a high-speed link between Oslo and Gothenburg. On the Swedish side the final 78 kilometers (48mi) to Öxnered is already finished. The Østfold Line has the largest potential for an increase in freight traffic, with an estimated eleven trains in each direction per day. These include freight trains to Götaland in Sweden, including a shuttle service to the Port of Gothenburg. Services could also run to Denmark and further south. Norway imports a lot of food and other goods but most of it enters Norway on road. The Østfold Line has a 11% share of the freight between the Oslo area and Swedish west coast. Two steep hills, Brynsbakken on the Loenga–Alnabru Line and Tistedalsbakken southeast of Halden are currently major obstacles, which limit train size and set locomotive requirements. Proposals have been made to build new lines to bypass these hills. One alternative to the south would be to build a new railway from around Berg to Skee on the Bohus Line in Sweden. The traffic on the Western Line will be so dense, especially during rush hour north of Moss, that it is possible that all freight trains may be routed via the Eastern Line. This will probably also mean that the existing railway between Sarpsborg and Halden will be kept, although it will probably be demolished north of Sarpsborg. The signaling system is scheduled to be renewed and replaced with the European Train Control System, with planned completion in 2030.",Normal

"Line 10 is a tram line which forms part of Metrovalencia in the city of Valencia, Spain. It opened on 17 May 2022. From 2007 until 2014, the line was designated as line 2. However, in November 2014, this designation was given to a branch of the existing Line 1, effective from April 2015. The line was then referred to as 'T2' until 1 March 2018 when it was decided to name it Line 10, to avoid confusion with existing metro lines. The first sections of the line had been built by 2007, with the part north of the city centre used by Line 6. A lack of available funds as a result of the Spanish economic crisis led to work being halted on the remaining sections. In June 2017, work resumed, with funding from the European Union and regional government used to complete the southern half of the line. Construction of the central part of the line has been indefinitely halted. The route originally planned included a section between Xàtiva and Tavernes Blanques which has been suspended indefinitely. The suspended section was to pass through the district of Orriols, following the current Line 6 as far as Alfauir station, entering the north-south tunnel at Pont de Fusta. Underground stops were planned in Valencia's old town at the Serrano Towers (under the old riverbed), Carme and the central market (Mercat station) before reaching the current main train station at Xàtiva. The completed route begins at the future central station. It continues underground along Avenida del Regne de València, turning right into Luís de Santángel and Amado Granell with an underground station at Germans Maristes, reaching the surface again near the crossroads of Amado GranellAvenida de la Plata. From there it runs on the surface to the City of Arts and Sciences, and the Natzaret neighbourhood. Construction began in January 2007 and the first sections of the line north of the city centre were completed later that year and put into use as part of Line 6 on 28 September 2007. The remaining sections were intended to be completed by 2010. However, work was eventually halted as funding ran out. In an interview in December 2011, Isabel Bonig, the regional minister responsible, stated that completion would be impossible without external help, for example from the central government. The cost of completing the remaining sections was estimated at 160 million euros. As of May 2012, 5.2 kilometres of the southern route had been completed between Natzaret and Calle Alicante, near the main train station. This included a 2.3 km underground section. However, a half kilometre of overground track in this section had not yet been completed, including the Germans Maristes station. Between Calle Alicante and the Serranos Towers, only the Mercat station had been completed in the old town. In May 2012, accidents suffered by pedestrians on the metro bridge over the railway line near the district of Natzaret and flooding of the tunnel already completed on Avenida Regne de València forced the Council of infrastructure to ask for tenders for the maintenance, inspection and cleaning of the sections already completed. The cost of this for six months was estimated to be 264,359 euros plus VAT. In November 2012, Bonig admitted that it was doubtful that Line 2 would be completed in 2013 as the required funds were not yet available. In January 2014, she said that completion of the line was a financial impossibility before the Valencian regional elections scheduled to be held by May 2015. In July 2015, it was estimated that 190 million euros would be required to complete the line. The cost of maintaining the sections already built was 400,000 euros per year. As of October 2015, spending on the line totalled 195 million euro. 51 million had been spent on the Mercat station with the rest on the tram line between the proposed Natzaret station and Calle Alicante. In that month, the regional government began removing the rails which had been installed on the surface to avoid traffic accidents. To complete the Natzaret to Calle Alicante section, 100 million euro was needed as of August 2015. On 11 June 2017, Valencian regional president Ximo Puig announced that work on the southern half of the line between Natzaret and Xàtiva would resume. The regional government will provide €30 million of funding, with another €20 million of funds coming from the European Union. Only one station on the northern half of the line, Mercat Central, was completed at a cost of 27 million euros, but remains a ghost station. In March 2021, the director of Valencian railways said that the sections north of Alacant station had been abandoned and that a decision would be taken on how to use the Mercat Central station. This left Line 10 unconnected with the rest of the network. To improve accessibility, the regional government announced that a foot tunnel would be built between Xàtiva and Alacant stations, predicted to open in early 2024. In the first year of operations 1.7 million people used the line. Alacant station was used by 488,204 passengers, Ciutat Arts i Ciències-Justícia by 299,898, Quatre Carreres by 262,038; Natzaret by 202,658, Amado Granell-Montolivet by 182,791, Russafa by 142,082, Oceanogràfic by 60,887, and Moreres by 46,147 passengers.",Normal
"""My Hero"" is a song by American rock band Foo Fighters. It was released in January 1998 as the third single from their second album, The Colour and the Shape (1997). The song, which reached number six on the US Billboard Alternative Songs chart, is a Foo Fighters classic and a staple at the band's concerts. Although the song was first released on The Colour and the Shape album in 1997, it was played live as early as 1995. On July 17, 1995, Grohl demoed the hit song for the first time by himself on an 8-track reel-to-reel in the basement of his Seattle home. The demo features Grohl singing and playing drums, bass, and guitars. Although the lyrics are not complete, the vocal melody is the same as the melody of the final studio recording of the song. In the Foo Fighters 2011 documentary Foo Fighters: Back and Forth, bassist Nate Mendel states he knew the band had a future when he heard Grohl’s demo of ""My Hero"" “because the song was great”. In a 1999 interview, Grohl said that the song is ""'about heroes that are ordinary'"" and added that he looks up to everyday people more than he looks up to celebrities. During Foo Fighters' appearance on VH1 Storytellers in 2009, Grohl explained that the song was written while watching 1980s movies like Valley Girl. Grohl also stated that the band wrote the song about Pete Stahl and Chip Donaldson without even knowing it. The recording of the song was done using two different drum tracks played back simultaneously for the introduction and verses. The music video for ""My Hero"" was directed by Dave Grohl. It features a man running into a burning building to rescue a woman's baby, another woman's dog, and finally a framed picture of the first woman. The eyes of both the baby and the dog are blocked out. The camera follows the man throughout the video, with his face never being shown. It is presented in a continuous ""long take"" format, although actual transitional cuts are disguised by smoke. During shots inside the building, the band is seen performing the song, seemingly unconcerned about the chaos around them. ""My Hero"" is widely regarded as one of the Foo Fighters' best songs. ""My Hero"" was ranked by Entertainment Weekly as Foo Fighters' 14th-greatest song, was ranked by Kerrang as Foo Fighters' seventh-greatest song, was ranked by American Songwriter as the greatest Foo Fighters song, and was ranked by Rolling Stone readers as Foo Fighters' fourth-greatest song. The song was featured in the movie Varsity Blues during the climactic scene of the final football game. The scene was later parodied in the 2001 film Not Another Teen Movie. The song also appeared in the 2010 films Somewhere and The Other Guys, when part of the song was heard during the scene where two characters (played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson) jump to their death (the song ending rather abruptly when they hit the ground). In a post-September 11 episode of CBS's The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn (September 21, 2001), Grohl and bassist Nate Mendel performed an acoustic rendition of the song. A full group acoustic version is available on the 2006 live album and DVD Skin and Bones. An acoustic version was also performed live on The Howard Stern Show by Grohl in 1999. The 2006 album Sound of Superman features an acoustic cover of ""My Hero"" by Paramore. My Hero was featured in the game Gran Turismo 2. The song, along with the rest of the album, was released as downloadable content for the Rock Band series of music video games on November 13, 2008. It is also one of 38 songs included on the benefit album, Songs for Japan (compiled in response to the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami in Tōhoku), released on March 25, 2011. In 2008, Foo Fighters criticized the campaign of Republican presidential candidate John McCain for using their song at rallies without their permission. Foo Fighters responded to the incident, saying: ""It's frustrating and infuriating that someone who claims to speak for the American people would repeatedly show such little respect for creativity and intellectual property. . . The saddest thing about this is that 'My Hero' was written as a celebration of the common man and his extraordinary potential. To have it appropriated without our knowledge and used in a manner that perverts the original sentiment of the lyric just tarnishes the song."" The McCain campaign asserted that the song was used properly under blanket licensing (which does not require the artist's permission), and all proper royalties were paid. The band played a stripped-down, acoustic version of the song during an appearance at the end of the 2012 Democratic National Convention, in which McCain's opponent Barack Obama secured the presidential nomination.

"Liu Xiang (77–6BCE), born Liu Gengsheng and bearing the courtesy name Zizheng, was a Chinese astronomer, historian, librarian, poet, politician, and writer of the Western Han dynasty. Among his polymathic scholarly specialties were history, literary bibliography, and astronomy. He is particularly well known for his bibliographic work in cataloging and editing the extensive imperial library. Liu Gengsheng was born in Xuzhou. Being a distant relative of Liu Bang, the founder of the Han dynasty, he was thus a member of the ruling dynastic clan (the Liu family). Liu Xiang's father ranked as a marquess. Liu Xiang's son, Liu Xin, would continue the scholarly tradition of his father and his relative Liu An (the Prince of Huainan). By the beginning of Han Yuandi's reign, Liu Xiang was a member of a group of Confucian officials, including Xiao Wangzhi, who wished to limit the power of the emperor's female family members relatives' clans, the Shi and the Xu. He ended up on the losing side of a power struggle between the powerful eunuch's Hong Gong and Shi Xian. Briefly imprisoned, Liu Xiang was terminated from his official position, and he received no new appointments to the office for the next fifteen years. The succession of Emperor Cheng to the imperial throne was accompanied by a realignment of power among the various factions involved in government, and Liu Xiang was able to revive his official prospects. In 26 BCE, at the command of the emperor, Liu Xiang spent much of the rest of the 20-odd years of his life engaged in the massive bibliographic work of organizing the imperial library.: 51 This work was assisted by his son, Liu Xin, who finally completed the task after his father's death. Liu compiled the first catalogue of the imperial library, the Abstracts (別錄, Bielu), and is the first known editor of the Classic of Mountains and Seas (Shanhaijing), which was finished by his son. Liu also edited collections of stories and biographies, including the Strategies of the Warring States (Zhanguoce), the New Prefaces (新序, Xinxu), the Garden of Stories (說苑, Shuoyuan), and the Biographies of Exemplary Women (Lienüzhuan). He has long erroneously been credited with compiling the Biographies of the Immortals (Liexian Zhuan), a collection of Taoist hagiographies and hymns. Liu Xiang was also a poet. He is credited with the ""Nine Laments"" (""Jiu Tan"") that appears in the Songs of Chu.",Normal
"The Old Marine Hospital is a historic medical building at 20 Franklin Street in Charleston, South Carolina. Built 1831–33 to a design by Robert Mills, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973 for its association with Mills, and as a high-quality example of Gothic Revival architecture. The hospital was built as a public facility for the treatment of sick sailors and other transient persons. The Old Marine Hospital is located in the historic center of Charleston, on the east side of Franklin Street, just south of the Old Charleston Jail. It is a two-story masonry structure, with a hip roof and a raised, arcaded basement that is a characteristic Mills element. A two-story porch extends across the seven-bay facade, with entrances to the porch at the end bays, which have two-story Gothic arches. The porch bays are articulated by clusters of columns, and the iron railings also have a Gothic motif. The main entrance is at the center of the facade, with flanking bays containing tall Gothic windows. When originally built, the building had two long wings extending from its rear; these were damaged by fire and removed during restoration work. The City of Charleston undertook its operation in 1834, charging arriving ships a fee to support its operation. During the Civil War, it was used for Confederate forces as well as seamen. It was badly damaged by Union bombardment. From 1866 to 1870, the Episcopal Church ran a school for African American children. In March 1893, Rev. D.J. Jenkins requested that he be allowed to operate his orphanage for African American children in the site, but the building needed $3000 to $5000 in repairs. In 1895 to 1939, it was the home of the Jenkins Orphanage for young African American children. It was remodeled in 1939 for offices of the Housing Authority of Charleston. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1973. The building was named one of the African American Historic Places in South Carolina.",Normal

"Dendrobates talamancae Cope, 1875 ""1876"" Colostethus talamancae (Cope, 1875) Allobates talamancae (common names: Talamanca rocket frog, striped rocket frog, Talamanca striped rocket frog) is a species of frog in the family Aromobatidae. It is found in northwestern Ecuador, western Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, and southern Nicaragua. Allobates talamancae is a small, non-toxic frog, with males measuring 17–24mm (0.67–0.94in) in snout–vent length and females 16–25mm (0.63–0.98in). The dorsum is smooth and dark brown in color. The flanks are black, bordered by tan or bronze line above and a white line below. The ventrum is white. The fingers and toes are unwebbed. Allobates talamancae lay the eggs in the leaf-litter, and both parents carry the tadpoles to streams where they complete their development in small, water-filled depressions. Allobates talamancae is found in a variety of habitats in very humid lowland and premontane habitats (secondary growth and plantations, swampy areas in primary forest, but not in open areas), usually close to streams. It can be found up to 800m (2,600ft) (970m (3,180ft) in Colombia) above sea level. Its diet consists of small arthropods. Adult frogs are found to aggregate, forming small groups, likely as an anti-predator adaptation. While it is a common species, its conservation is threatened by habitat loss, introduction of alien predatory fish, and pollution.",Normal

"Metal Masters is a 2D fighting video game first released in 1991 for the Atari ST, IBM PC, and Amiga. It was ported to the Nintendo Game Boy in 1993. The story starts with a villain called the Baron, the Baron is looking for the parts needed to construct the ultimate robot. The player's job is to destroy the robots, thus destroying the parts needed by the Baron. The player controls a robot, the starting robot is a very basic model, to which the player can add ""improvements"" with credits earned during gameplay. There are four areas that each robot is graded on, body, left arm, right arm, and legs.

"Energy recovery includes any technique or method of minimizing the input of energy to an overall system by the exchange of energy from one sub-system of the overall system with another. The energy can be in any form in either subsystem, but most energy recovery systems exchange thermal energy in either sensible or latent form. In some circumstances the use of an enabling technology, either daily thermal energy storage or seasonal thermal energy storage (STES, which allows heat or cold storage between opposing seasons), is necessary to make energy recovery practicable. One example is waste heat from air conditioning machinery stored in a buffer tank to aid in night time heating. A common application of this principle is in systems which have an exhaust stream or waste stream which is transferred from the system to its surroundings. Some of the energy in that flow of material (often gaseous or liquid) may be transferred to the make-up or input material flow. This input mass flow often comes from the system's surroundings, which, being at ambient conditions, are at a lower temperature than the waste stream. This temperature differential allows heat transfer and thus energy transfer, or in this case, recovery. Thermal energy is often recovered from liquid or gaseous waste streams to fresh make-up air and water intakes in buildings, such as for the HVAC systems, or process systems. Energy consumption is a key part of most human activities. This consumption involves converting one energy system to another, for example: The conversion of mechanical energy to electrical energy, which can then power computers, light, motors etc. The input energy propels the work and is mostly converted to heat or follows the product in the process as output energy. Energy recovery systems harvest the output power and provide this as input power to the same or another process. An energy recovery system will close this energy cycle to prevent the input power from being released back to nature and rather be used in other forms of desired work. Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) is a technology solution to the challenge of improving the fuel efficiency of gas and diesel engines by recovering waste energy from the exhaust gases. There is a large potential for energy recovery in compact systems like large industries and utilities. Together with energy conservation, it should be possible to dramatically reduce world energy consumption. The effect of this will then be: In 2008 Tom Casten, chairman of Recycled Energy Development, said that ""We think we could make about 19 to 20 percent of U.S. electricity with heat that is currently thrown away by industry."" A 2007 Department of Energy study found the potential for 135,000 megawatts of combined heat and power (which uses energy recovery) in the U.S., and a Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory study identified about 64,000 megawatts that could be obtained from industrial waste energy, not counting CHP. These studies suggest that about 200,000 megawatts, or 20%, of total power capacity could come from energy recycling in the U.S. Widespread use of energy recycling could therefore reduce global warming emissions by an estimated 20 percent. Indeed, as of 2005, about 42% of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution came from the production of electricity and 27% from the production of heat. It is difficult to quantify the environmental impact of a global energy recovery implementation in some sectors. The main impediments are:",Normal

"Island in the Sky is a 1953 American aviation adventure drama film written by Ernest K. Gann based on his 1944 novel of the same name, directed by William A. Wellman and starring and coproduced by John Wayne. Because of its realistic depiction of an actual aircraft crash, some consider the film as among the classic aviation films. The film also features Andy Devine, Lloyd Nolan, James Arness and Paul Fix. Pilot John Dooley and the crew of a World War II-era Douglas C-47 Skytrain (the military version of the DC-3) experience icy conditions and are forced to execute an emergency landing on a frozen lake in the uncharted wildlands near the Quebec–Labrador border. Dooley is a former airline pilot who had been pressed into duty hauling war supplies across the northern route to England. Far from settled country, the survivors can provide only an approximate position to rescuers. Dooley must keep his men alive while waiting for rescue in the extreme winter cold with temperatures plummeting to −70°F (−57°C). At headquarters, Col. Fuller gathers fellow airmen who are determined to find the downed crew before the men succumb to hunger and the cold. The search pilots experience tension and fear and are unsure about their course of action, aware that a wrong decision could doom the missing crew. The script was based on a true story about a flight on February 3, 1943, although its copilot was not killed as in the film. In his autobiography Fate Is the Hunter, on which the film of the same name is very loosely based, writer Ernest K. Gann related the true story and his role as one of the search pilots while serving with Air Transport Command at Presque Isle Airfield, Maine. Gann had been scheduled to fly the mission that ran into trouble, but was bumped from the flight by a more senior pilot. The rights to the story were originally bought in January 1950 by Robert Stillman Productions, and Gann planned to write the screenplay with Seton I. Miller. Frank Rosenberg was scheduled to produce the film, which would star Richard Widmark. When Stillman dropped the film, the rights were picked up in December 1952 by Wayne-Fellows Productions, the partnership of John Wayne and Robert Fellows, as their third of seven eventual productions, including the following year's Gann story The High and the Mighty, also starring Wayne. The two films shared many of the same production staff and crew members, including director William Wellman. Wellman had been a pilot with the Lafayette Flying Corps during World War I, where he earned the nickname Wild Bill, and with the United States Army Air Service after the war. He was a veteran aviation film director whose Wings won the first Academy Award (1927–1928). Wellman provides the voiceover narration that begins the film, and his two sons Tim and Mike, who were eleven and five at the time, play Andy Devine's sons. The women in the film, Ann Doran, Dawn Bender and Phyllis Winger, appear only in brief flashbacks and in a telephone conversation. The lack of a romantic interest was noted by critics, who considered the film a more authentic and gritty drama as compared to the usual Hollywood war pictures. Wellman had an adversarial relationship with actors and was known to prefer to work with men; many of his films are set in predominantly male worlds. The role played by Wayne in Island in the Sky goes against type, as he does not display the machismo for which he was often criticized. His portrayal of the downed aircraft's captain had been noted as believable and realistic. A strong ensemble cast of mainly studio B-actors contained a number of future stars, including Fess Parker, James Arness, Darryl Hickman and Mike Connors, all of whom would realize television fame. The black-and-white cinematography by Archie Stout (dramatic scenes) and William H. Clothier (flying scenes) has been praised by critics. Production began in late January 1953 and was completed on March 2. Filming took place partly at Donner Lake, near Truckee, California in the Sierra Nevada range. The California Department of Forestry felled trees in the area in order that aircraft runways could be fashioned in the four-foot-deep snow. Some background shooting also took place in San Francisco. In addition to writing the screenplay, Gann, a commercial pilot for Transocean Air Lines, served as the film's technical director and also piloted a C-47 for the second unit. The hand-cranked emergency radio transmitter used by the crew members to try to contact rescuers was an actual piece of equipment, a BC-778SCR-578AN-CRT3 emergency transmitter, affectionately called Gibson Girl after the 1890s drawings of Charles Dana Gibson. The narrow-waisted shape of the device allowed the operator to hold it between the legs while cranking it—a necessity because it required 80 rpm and was difficult to crank. Island in the Sky and The High and the Mighty, released the following year, are two of the earliest all-star disaster films, paving the way for Airport and its sequels more than 20 years later, as well as the Airplane! parodies. The two films are among Wayne's early co-productions in which he starred. This practice would not become widespread until the 1980s and 1990s when many stars assumed control of productions. Both films were aviation dramas and shared many of the same crew members and production staff. Along with Wayne, six actors appeared in both films: Regis Toomey, Paul Fix, Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer, Ann Doran, George Chandler and Michael Wellman (the director's son). Gann wrote both screenplays. Island in the Sky premiered in Los Angeles on September 3, 1953 and entered general release two days later. The premiere showing featured stereophonic sound, but an intermission period was necessitated because of problems with it. In a contemporary review for The New York Times, critic Howard Thompson wrote: Whenever the action of this erratic and unsurprising Warner presentation is permitted to speak for itself, it vibrates with pictorial and muscular conviction. But if Mr. Gann is primarily bent, as it appears, on stressing man's perennial displacement by hostile natural elements, the camera stays three jumps ahead of him. Indeed, the stark, gleaming vastness of the backgrounds minimizes the pretentious camouflaging of a simple, perfectly legitimate story idea, including the characters, some high-flying dialogue and whatever Mr. Gann is actually driving at. ... On the whole, 'Island in the Sky' remains a standard reply to an extraordinarily simple challenge. Both Island in the Sky and The High and the Mighty were out of circulation for about 20 years because of legal issues. They were restored, returned to television in July 2005 and released as special edition DVDs that August.",Normal

Garcia defeated state legislator Steve Farley in the August 2018 Democratic gubernatorial primary. While Garcia's 2014 bid attracted independent and Republican support, his 2018 campaign was considered progressive. Garcia's 2018 bid focused on supporting Medicare for All, raising income taxes to spend more on education initiatives, and opposing a wall along Arizona's southern border with Mexico. He also supported a “top-to-bottom” overhaul of ICE. Garcia's candidacy for governor had been compared to the candidacies of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In 2021, the Arizona Daily Star described Garcia as ""a weak candidate with a campaign beset by missteps, including what was interpreted as a call for open borders"". On Election Day, Garcia was defeated by Ducey, 56.0%-41.8%. Garcia is married to Lori Higuera, a corporate attorney in the Phoenix area. They have two daughters.",Normal

"Konstantin Sergeyevich Stanislavski (Russian: Константин Сергеевич Станиславский, IPA: ; néAlekseyev ; 17 January1863– 7 August 1938) was a seminal Soviet Russian theatre practitioner. He was widely recognized as an outstanding character actor, and the many productions that he directed garnered him a reputation as one of the leading theatre directors of his generation. His principal fame and influence, however, rests on his ""system"" of actor training, preparation, and rehearsal technique. Stanislavski (his stage name) performed and directed as an amateur until the age of 33, when he co-founded the world-famous Moscow Art Theatre (MAT) company with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, following a legendary 18-hour discussion. Its influential tours of Europe (1906) and the US (1923–24), and its landmark productions of The Seagull (1898) and Hamlet (1911–12), established his reputation and opened new possibilities for the art of the theatre. By means of the MAT, Stanislavski was instrumental in promoting the new Russian drama of his day—principally the work of Anton Chekhov, Maxim Gorky, and Mikhail Bulgakov—to audiences in Moscow and around the world; he also staged acclaimed productions of a wide range of classical Russian and European plays. He collaborated with the director and designer Edward Gordon Craig and was formative in the development of several other major practitioners, including Vsevolod Meyerhold (whom Stanislavski considered his ""sole heir in the theatre""), Yevgeny Vakhtangov, and Michael Chekhov. At the MAT's 30-year anniversary celebrations in 1928, a massive heart attack on-stage put an end to his acting career (though he waited until the curtain fell before seeking medical assistance). He continued to direct, teach, and write about acting until his death a few weeks before the publication of the first volume of his life's great work, the acting manual An Actor's Work (1938). He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour and the Order of Lenin and was the first to be granted the title of People's Artist of the USSR. Stanislavski wrote that ""there is nothing more tedious than an actor's biography"" and that ""actors should be banned from talking about themselves"". At the request of a US publisher, however, he reluctantly agreed to write his autobiography, My Life in Art (first published in English in 1924 and in a revised, Russian-language edition in 1926), though its account of his artistic development is not always accurate. Three English-language biographies have been published: David Magarshack's Stanislavsky: A Life (1950); Jean Benedetti's Stanislavski: His Life and Art (1988, revised and expanded 1999). and Nikolai M Gorchakov's ""Stanislavsky Directs"" (1954). An out-of-print English translation of Elena Poliakova's 1977 Russian biography of Stanislavski was also published in 1982. Stanislavski subjected his acting and direction to a rigorous process of artistic self-analysis and reflection. His system of acting developed out of his persistent efforts to remove the blocks that he encountered in his performances, beginning with a major crisis in 1906. He produced his early work using an external, director-centred technique that strove for an organic unity of all its elements—in each production he planned the interpretation of every role, blocking, and the mise en scène in detail in advance. He also introduced into the production process a period of discussion and detailed analysis of the play by the cast. Despite the success that this approach brought, particularly with his Naturalistic stagings of the plays of Anton Chekhov and Maxim Gorky, Stanislavski remained dissatisfied. Both his struggles with Chekhov's drama (out of which his notion of subtext emerged) and his experiments with Symbolism encouraged a greater attention to ""inner action"" and a more intensive investigation of the actor's process. He began to develop the more actor-centred techniques of ""psychological realism"" and his focus shifted from his productions to rehearsal process and pedagogy. He pioneered the use of theatre studios as a laboratory in which to innovate actor training and to experiment with new forms of theatre. Stanislavski organised his techniques into a coherent, systematic methodology, which built on three major strands of influence: (1) the director-centred, unified aesthetic and disciplined, ensemble approach of the Meiningen company; (2) the actor-centred realism of the Maly; and (3) the Naturalistic staging of Antoine and the independent theatre movement. The system cultivates what Stanislavski calls the ""art of experiencing"" (to which he contrasts the ""art of representation""). It mobilises the actor's conscious thought and will to activate other, less-controllable psychological processes—such as emotional experience and subconscious behaviour—sympathetically and indirectly. In rehearsal, the actor searches for inner motives to justify action and the definition of what the character seeks to achieve at any given moment (a ""task""). Stanislavski's earliest reference to his system appears in 1909, the same year that he first incorporated it into his rehearsal process. The MAT adopted it as its official rehearsal method in 1911. Later, Stanislavski further elaborated the system with a more physically grounded rehearsal process that came to be known as the ""Method of Physical Action"". Minimising at-the-table discussions, he now encouraged an ""active analysis"", in which the sequence of dramatic situations are improvised. ""The best analysis of a play"", Stanislavski argued, ""is to take action in the given circumstances."" Just as the First Studio, led by his assistant and close friend Leopold Sulerzhitsky, had provided the forum in which he developed his initial ideas for the system during the 1910s, he hoped to secure his final legacy by opening another studio in 1935, in which the Method of Physical Action would be taught. The Opera-Dramatic Studio embodied the most complete implementation of the training exercises described in his manuals. Meanwhile, the transmission of his earlier work via the students of the First Studio was revolutionising acting in the West. With the arrival of Socialist realism in the USSR, the MAT and Stanislavski's system were enthroned as exemplary models. Stanislavski had a privileged youth, growing up in one of the richest families in Russia, the Alekseyevs. He was born Konstantin Sergeyevich Alekseyev—he adopted the stage name ""Stanislavski"" in 1884 to keep his performance activities secret from his parents. Up until the communist revolution in 1917, Stanislavski often used his inherited wealth to fund his experiments in acting and directing. His family's discouragement meant that he appeared only as an amateur until he was thirty three. As a child, Stanislavski was interested in the circus, the ballet, and puppetry. Later, his family's two private theatres provided a forum for his theatrical impulses. After his debut performance at one in 1877, he started what would become a lifelong series of notebooks filled with critical observations on his acting, aphorisms, and problems—it was from this habit of self-analysis and critique that Stanislavski's system later emerged. Stanislavski chose not to attend university, preferring to work in the family business. Increasingly interested in ""experiencing the role"", Stanislavski experimented with maintaining a characterization in real life. In 1884, he began vocal training under Fyodor Komissarzhevsky, with whom he also explored the coordination of body and voice. A year later, Stanislavski briefly studied at the Moscow Theatre School but, disappointed with its approach, he left after little more than two weeks. Instead, he devoted particular attention to the performances of the Maly Theatre, the home of Russian psychological realism (as developed in the 19th century by Alexander Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol and Mikhail Shchepkin). Shchepkin's legacy included a disciplined, ensemble approach, extensive rehearsals, and the use of careful observation, self-knowledge, imagination, and emotion as the cornerstones of the craft. Stanislavski called the Maly his ""university"". One of Shchepkin's students, Glikeriya Fedotova, taught Stanislavski; she instilled in him the rejection of inspiration as the basis of the actor's art, stressed the importance of training and discipline, and encouraged the practice of responsive interaction with other actors that Stanislavski came to call ""communication"". As well as the artists of the Maly, performances given by foreign stars influenced Stanislavski. The effortless, emotive, and clear playing of the Italian Ernesto Rossi, who performed major Shakespearean tragic protagonists in Moscow in 1877, particularly impressed him. So too did Tommaso Salvini's 1882 performance of Othello. By now well known as an amateur actor, at the age of twenty-five Stanslavski co-founded a Society of Art and Literature. Under its auspices, he performed in plays by Molière, Schiller, Pushkin, and Ostrovsky, as well as gaining his first experiences as a director. He became interested in the aesthetic theories of Vissarion Belinsky, from whom he took his conception of the role of the artist. On 5 July1889, Stanislavski married Maria Lilina (the stage name of Maria Petrovna Perevostchikova). Their first child, Xenia, died of pneumonia in May 1890 less than two months after she was born. Their second daughter, Kira, was born on 2 August1891. In January 1893, Stanislavski's father died. Their son Igor was born on 26 September1894. In February 1891, Stanislavski directed Leo Tolstoy's The Fruits of Enlightenment for the Society of Art and Literature, in what he later described as his first fully independent directorial work. But it was not until 1893 he first met the great realist novelist and playwright that became another important influence on him. Five years later the MAT would be his response to Tolstoy's demand for simplicity, directness, and accessibility in art. Stanislavski's directorial methods at this time were closely modelled on the disciplined, autocratic approach of Ludwig Chronegk, the director of the Meiningen Ensemble. In My Life in Art (1924), Stanislavski described this approach as one in which the director is ""forced to work without the help of the actor"". From 1894 onward, Stanislavski began to assemble detailed prompt-books that included a directorial commentary on the entire play and from which not even the smallest detail was allowed to deviate. Whereas the Ensemble's effects tended toward the grandiose, Stanislavski introduced lyrical elaborations through the mise-en-scène that dramatised more mundane and ordinary elements of life, in keeping with Belinsky's ideas about the ""poetry of the real"". By means of his rigid and detailed control of all theatrical elements, including the strict choreography of the actors' every gesture, in Stanislavski's words ""the inner kernel of the play was revealed by itself"". Analysing the Society's production of Othello (1896), Jean Benedetti observes that: Stanislavski uses the theatre and its technical possibilities as an instrument of expression, a language, in its own right. The dramatic meaning is in the staging itself.  He went through the whole play in a completely different way, not relying on the text as such, with quotes from important speeches, not providing a 'literary' explanation, but speaking in terms of the play's dynamic, its action, the thoughts and feelings of the protagonists, the world in which they lived. His account flowed uninterruptedly from moment to moment. Benedetti argues that Stanislavski's task at this stage was to unite the realistic tradition of the creative actor inherited from Shchepkin and Gogol with the director-centred, organically unified Naturalistic aesthetic of the Meiningen approach. That synthesis would emerge eventually, but only in the wake of Stanislavski's directorial struggles with Symbolist theatre and an artistic crisis in his work as an actor. ""The task of our generation"", Stanislavski wrote as he was about to found the Moscow Art Theatre and begin his professional life in the theatre, is ""to liberate art from outmoded tradition, from tired cliché and to give greater freedom to imagination and creative ability."" Stanislavski's historic meeting with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko on 4 July1897 led to the creation of what was called initially the ""Moscow Public-Accessible Theatre"", but which came to be known as the Moscow Art Theatre (MAT). Their eighteen-hour-long discussion has acquired a legendary status in the history of theatre. Nemirovich was a successful playwright, critic, theatre director, and acting teacher at the Philharmonic School who, like Stanislavski, was committed to the idea of a popular theatre. Their abilities complemented one another: Stanislavski brought his directorial talent for creating vivid stage images and selecting significant details; Nemirovich, his talent for dramatic and literary analysis, his professional expertise, and his ability to manage a theatre. Stanislavski later compared their discussions to the Treaty of Versailles, their scope was so wide-ranging; they agreed on the conventional practices they wished to abandon and, on the basis of the working method they found they had in common, defined the policy of their new theatre. Stanislavski and Nemirovich planned a professional company with an ensemble ethos that discouraged individual vanity; they would create a realistic theatre of international renown, with popular prices for seats, whose organically unified aesthetic would bring together the techniques of the Meiningen Ensemble and those of André Antoine's Théâtre Libre (which Stanislavski had seen during trips to Paris). Nemirovich assumed that Stanislavski would fund the theatre as a privately owned business, but Stanislavski insisted on a limited, joint stock company. Viktor Simov, whom Stanislavski had met in 1896, was engaged as the company's principal designer. In his opening speech on the first day of rehearsals, 26 June1898, Stanislavski stressed the ""social character"" of their collective undertaking. In an atmosphere more like a university than a theatre, as Stanislavski described it, the company was introduced to his working method of extensive reading and research and detailed rehearsals in which the action was defined at the table before being explored physically. Stanislavski's lifelong relationship with Vsevolod Meyerhold began during these rehearsals; by the end of June, Meyerhold was so impressed with Stanislavski's directorial skills that he declared him a genius. The lasting significance of Stanislavski's early work at the MAT lies in its development of a Naturalistic performance mode. In 1898, Stanislavski co-directed with Nemirovich the first of his productions of the work of Anton Chekhov. The MAT production of The Seagull was a crucial milestone for the fledgling company that has been described as ""one of the greatest events in the history of Russian theatre and one of the greatest new developments in the history of world drama."" Despite its 80 hours of rehearsal—a considerable length by the standards of the conventional practice of the day—Stanislavski felt it was under-rehearsed. The production's success was due to the fidelity of its delicate representation of everyday life, its intimate, ensemble playing, and the resonance of its mood of despondent uncertainty with the psychological disposition of the Russian intelligentsia of the time. Stanislavski went on to direct the successful premières of Chekhov's other major plays: Uncle Vanya in 1899 (in which he played Astrov), Three Sisters in 1901 (playing Vershinin), and The Cherry Orchard in 1904 (playing Gaev). Stanislavski's encounter with Chekhov's drama proved crucial to the creative development of both men. His ensemble approach and attention to the psychological realities of its characters revived Chekhov's interest in writing for the stage, while Chekhov's unwillingness to explain or expand on the text forced Stanislavski to dig beneath its surface in ways that were new in theatre. In response to Stanislavski's encouragement, Maxim Gorky promised to launch his playwrighting career with the MAT. In 1902, Stanislavski directed the première productions of the first two of Gorky's plays, The Philistines and The Lower Depths. As part of the rehearsal preparations for the latter, Stanislavski took the company to visit Khitrov Market, where they talked to its down-and-outs and soaked up its atmosphere of destitution. Stanislavski based his characterisation of Satin on an ex-officer he met there, who had fallen into poverty through gambling. The Lower Depths was a triumph that matched the production of The Seagull four years earlier, though Stanislavski regarded his own performance as external and mechanical. The productions of The Cherry Orchard and The Lower Depths remained in the MAT's repertoire for decades. Along with Chekhov and Gorky, the drama of Henrik Ibsen formed an important part of Stanislavski's work at this time—in its first two decades, the MAT staged more plays by Ibsen than any other playwright. In its first decade, Stanislavski directed Hedda Gabler (in which he played Løvborg), An Enemy of the People (playing Dr Stockmann, his favorite role), The Wild Duck, and Ghosts. ""More's the pity I was not a Scandinavian and never saw how Ibsen was played in Scandinavia,"" Stanislavski wrote, because ""those who have been there tell me that he is interpreted as simply, as true to life, as we play Chekhov"". He also staged other important Naturalistic works, including Gerhart Hauptmann's Drayman Henschel, Lonely People, and Michael Kramer and Leo Tolstoy's The Power of Darkness. In 1904, Stanislavski finally acted on a suggestion made by Chekhov two years earlier that he stage several one-act plays by Maurice Maeterlinck, the Belgian Symbolist. Despite his enthusiasm, however, Stanislavski struggled to realise a theatrical approach to the static, lyrical dramas. When the triple bill consisting of The Blind, Intruder, and Interior opened on 15 October , the experiment was deemed a failure. Meyerhold, prompted by Stanislavski's positive response to his new ideas about Symbolist theatre, proposed that they form a ""theatre studio"" (a term which he invented) that would function as ""a laboratory for the experiments of more or less experienced actors."" The Theatre-Studio aimed to develop Meyerhold's aesthetic ideas into new theatrical forms that would return the MAT to the forefront of the avant-garde and Stanislavski's socially conscious ideas for a network of ""people's theatres"" that would reform Russian theatrical culture as a whole. Central to Meyerhold's approach was the use of improvisation to develop the performances. When the studio presented a work-in-progress, Stanislavski was encouraged; when performed in a fully equipped theatre in Moscow, however, it was regarded as a failure and the studio folded. Meyerhold drew an important lesson: ""one must first educate a new actor and only then put new tasks before him"", he wrote, adding that ""Stanislavski, too, came to such a conclusion."" Reflecting in 1908 on the Theatre-Studio's demise, Stanislavski wrote that ""our theatre found its future among its ruins."" Nemirovich disapproved of what he described as the malign influence of Meyerhold on Stanislavski's work at this time. Stanislavski engaged two important new collaborators in 1905: Liubov Gurevich became his literary advisor and Leopold Sulerzhitsky became his personal assistant. Stanislavski revised his interpretation of the role of Trigorin (and Meyerhold reprised his role as Konstantin) when the MAT revived its production of Chekhov's The Seagull on 13 October1905. This was the year of the abortive revolution in Russia. Stanislavski signed a protest against the violence of the secret police, Cossack troops, and the right-wing extremist paramilitary ""Black Hundreds"", which was submitted to the Duma on the 3 November . Rehearsals for the MAT's production of Alexander Griboyedov's classic verse comedy Woe from Wit were interrupted by gun-battles on the streets outside. Stanislavski and Nemirovich closed the theatre and embarked on the company's first tour outside of Russia. The MAT's first European tour began on 23 February1906 in Berlin, where they played to an audience that included Max Reinhardt, Gerhart Hauptmann, Arthur Schnitzler, and Eleonora Duse. ""It's as though we were the revelation"", Stanislavski wrote of the rapturous acclaim they received. The success of the tour provided financial security for the company, garnered an international reputation for their work, and made a significant impact on European theatre. The tour also provoked a major artistic crisis for Stanislavski that had a significant impact on his future direction. From his attempts to resolve this crisis, his system would eventually emerge. Sometime in March 1906—Jean Benedetti suggests that it was during An Enemy of the People—Stanislavski became aware that he was acting without a flow of inner impulses and feelings and that as a consequence his performance had become mechanical. He spent June and July in Finland on holiday, where he studied, wrote, and reflected. With his notebooks on his own experience from 1889 onwards, he attempted to analyze ""the foundation stones of our art"" and the actor's creative process in particular. He began to formulate a psychological approach to controlling the actor's process in a Manual on Dramatic Art. Stanislavski's activities began to move in a very different direction: his productions became opportunities for research, he was more interested in the process of rehearsal than its product, and his attention shifted away from the MAT towards its satellite projects—the theatre studios—in which he would develop his system. On his return to Moscow, he explored his new psychological approach in his production of Knut Hamsun's Symbolist play The Drama of Life. Nemirovich was particularly hostile to his new methods and their relationship continued to deteriorate in this period. In a statement made on 9 February1908, Stanislavski marked a significant shift in his directorial method and stressed the crucial contribution he now expected from a creative actor: The committee is wrong if it thinks that the director's preparatory work in the study is necessary, as previously, when he alone decided the whole plan and all the details of the production, wrote the mise en scène and answered all the actors' questions for them. The director is no longer king, as before, when the actor possessed no clear individuality.  It is essential to understand this—rehearsals are divided into two stages: the first stage is one of experiment when the cast helps the director, the second is creating the performance when the director helps the cast. Stanislavski's preparations for Maeterlinck's The Blue Bird (which was to become his most famous production to-date) included improvisations and other exercises to stimulate the actors' imaginations; Nemirovich described one in which the cast imitated various animals. In rehearsals he sought ways to encourage his actors' will to create afresh in every performance. He focused on the search for inner motives to justify action and the definition of what the characters are seeking to achieve at any given moment (what he would come to call their ""task""). This use of the actor's conscious thought and will was designed to activate other, less-controllable psychological processes—such as emotional experience and subconscious behaviour—sympathetically and indirectly. Noting the importance to great actors' performances of their ability to remain relaxed, he discovered that he could abolish physical tension by focusing his attention on the specific action that the play demanded; when his concentration wavered, his tension returned. ""What fascinates me most"", Stanislavski wrote in May 1908, ""is the rhythm of feelings, the development of affective memory and the psycho-physiology of the creative process."" His interest in the creative use of the actor's personal experiences was spurred by a chance conversation in Germany in July that led him to the work of French psychologist Théodule-Armand Ribot. His ""affective memory"" contributed to the technique that Stanislavski would come to call ""emotion memory"". Together these elements formed a new vocabulary with which he explored a ""return to realism"" in a production of Gogol's The Government Inspector as soon as The Blue Bird had opened. At a theatre conference on 21 March1909, Stanislavski delivered a paper on his emerging system that stressed the role of his techniques of the ""magic if"" (which encourages the actor to respond to the fictional circumstances of the play ""as if"" they were real) and emotion memory. He developed his ideas about three trends in the history of acting, which were to appear eventually in the opening chapters of An Actor's Work: ""stock-in-trade"" acting, the art of representation, and the art of experiencing (his own approach). Stanislavski's production of A Month in the Country (1909) was a watershed in his artistic development. Breaking the MAT's tradition of open rehearsals, he prepared Turgenev's play in private. They began with a discussion of what he would come to call the ""through-line"" for the characters (their emotional development and the way they change over the course of the play). This production is the earliest recorded instance of his practice of analysing the action of the script into discrete ""bits"". At this stage in the development of his approach, Stanislavski's technique was to identify the emotional state contained in the psychological experience of the character during each bit and, through the use of the actor's emotion memory, to forge a subjective connection to it. Only after two months of rehearsals were the actors permitted to physicalise the text. Stanislavski insisted that they should play the actions that their discussions around the table had identified. Having realised a particular emotional state in a physical action, he assumed at this point in his experiments, the actor's repetition of that action would evoke the desired emotion. As with his experiments in The Drama of Life, they also explored non-verbal communication, whereby scenes were rehearsed as ""silent études"" with actors interacting ""only with their eyes"". The production's success when it opened in December 1909 seemed to prove the validity of his new methodology. Late in 1910, Gorky invited Stanislavski to join him in Capri, where they discussed actor training and Stanislavski's emerging ""grammar"". Inspired by a popular theatre performance in Naples that employed the techniques of the commedia dell'arte, Gorky suggested that they form a company, modeled on the medieval strolling players, in which a playwright and group of young actors would devise new plays together by means of improvisation. Stanislavski would develop this use of improvisation in his work with his First Studio. In his treatment of the classics, Stanislavski believed that it was legitimate for actors and directors to ignore the playwright's intentions for a play's staging. One of his most important—a collaboration with Edward Gordon Craig on a production of Hamlet—became a landmark of 20th-century theatrical modernism. Stanislavski hoped to prove that his recently developed system for creating internally justified, realistic acting could meet the formal demands of a classic play. Craig envisioned a Symbolist monodrama in which every aspect of production would be subjugated to the protagonist: it would present a dream-like vision as seen through Hamlet's eyes. Despite these contrasting approaches, the two practitioners did share some artistic assumptions; the system had developed out of Stanislavski's experiments with Symbolist drama, which had shifted his attention from a Naturalistic external surface to the characters' subtextual, inner world. Both had stressed the importance of achieving a unity of all theatrical elements in their work. Their production attracted enthusiastic and unprecedented worldwide attention for the theatre, placing it ""on the cultural map for Western Europe"", and it has come to be regarded as a seminal event that revolutionised the staging of Shakespeare's plays. It became ""one of the most famous and passionately discussed productions in the history of the modern stage."" Increasingly absorbed by his teaching, in 1913 Stanislavski held open rehearsals for his production of Molière's The Imaginary Invalid as a demonstration of the system. As with his production of Hamlet and his next, Goldoni's The Mistress of the Inn, he was keen to assay his system in the crucible of a classical text. He began to inflect his technique of dividing the action of the play into bits with an emphasis on improvisation; he would progress from analysis, through free improvisation, to the language of the text: I divide the work into large bits clarifying the nature of each bit. Then, immediately, in my own words, I play each bit, observing all the curves. Then I go through the experiences of each bit ten times or so with its curves (not in a fixed way, not being consistent). Then I follow the successive bits in the book. And finally, I make the transition, imperceptibly, to the experiences as expressed in the actual words of the part. Stanislavski's struggles with both the Molière and Goldoni comedies revealed the importance of an appropriate definition of what he calls a character's ""super-task"" (the core problem that unites and subordinates the character's moment-to-moment tasks). This impacted particularly on the actors' ability to serve the plays' genre, because an unsatisfactory definition produced tragic rather than comic performances. Other European classics directed by Stanislavski include: Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, Twelfth Night, and Othello, an unfinished production of Molière's Tartuffe, and Beaumarchais's The Marriage of Figaro. Other classics of the Russian theatre directed by Stanislavki include: several plays by Ivan Turgenev, Griboyedov's Woe from Wit, Gogol's The Government Inspector, and plays by Tolstoy, Ostrovsky, and Pushkin. Following the success of his production of A Month in the Country, Stanislavski made repeated requests to the board of the MAT for proper facilities to pursue his pedagogical work with young actors. Gorky encouraged him not to found a drama school to teach inexperienced beginners, but rather—following the example of the Theatre-Studio of 1905—to create a studio for research and experiment that would train young professionals. Stanislavski created the First Studio on 14 September1912. Its founding members included Yevgeny Vakhtangov, Michael Chekhov, Richard Boleslawski, and Maria Ouspenskaya, all of whom would exert a considerable influence on the subsequent history of theatre. Stanislavski selected Suler (as Gorky had nicknamed Sulerzhitsky) to lead the studio. In a focused, intense atmosphere, their work emphasised experimentation, improvisation, and self-discovery. Following Gorky's suggestions about devising new plays through improvisation, they searched for ""the creative process common to authors, actors and directors"". Stanislavski created the Second Studio of the MAT in 1916, in response to a production of Zinaida Gippius' The Green Ring that a group of young actors had prepared independently. With a greater focus on pedagogical work than the First Studio, the Second Studio provided the environment in which Stanislavski developed the training techniques that would form the basis for his manual An Actor's Work (1938). A significant influence on the development of the system came from Stanislavski's experience teaching and directing at his Opera Studio, which was founded in 1918. He hoped that the successful application of his system to opera, with its inescapable conventionality and artifice, would demonstrate the universality of his approach to performance and unite the work of Mikhail Shchepkin and Feodor Chaliapin. From this experience Stanislavski's notion of ""tempo-rhythm"" emerged. He invited Serge Wolkonsky to teach diction and Lev Pospekhin to teach expressive movement and dance and attended both of their classes as a student. Stanislavski spent the summer of 1914 in Marienbad where, as he had in 1906, he researched the history of theatre and theories of acting to clarify the discoveries that his practical experiments had produced. When the First World War broke out, Stanislavski was in Munich. ""It seemed to me"", he wrote of the atmosphere at the train station in an article detailing his experiences, ""that death was hovering everywhere."" The train was stopped at Immenstadt, where German soldiers denounced him as a Russian spy. Held in a room at the station with a large crowd with ""the faces of wild beasts"" baying at its windows, Stanislavski believed he was to be executed. He remembered that he was carrying an official document that mentioned having played to Kaiser Wilhelm during their tour of 1906 that, when he showed it to the officers, produced a change of attitude towards his group. They were placed on a slow train to Kempten. Gurevich later related how during the journey Stanislavski surprised her when he whispered that: vents of recent days had given him a clear impression of the superficiality of all that was called human culture, bourgeois culture, that a completely different kind of life was needed, where all needs were reduced to the minimum, where there was work—real artistic work—on behalf of the people, for those who had not yet been consumed by this bourgeois culture. In Kempten they were again ordered into one of the station's rooms, where Stanislavski overheard the German soldiers complain of a lack of ammunition; it was only this, he understood, that prevented their execution. The following morning they were placed on a train and eventually returned to Russia via Switzerland and France. Turning to the classics of Russian theatre, the MAT revived Griboyedov's comedy Woe from Wit and planned to stage three of Pushkin's ""little tragedies"" in early 1915. Stanislavski continued to develop his system, explaining at an open rehearsal for Woe from Wit his concept of the state of ""I am being"". This term marks the stage in the rehearsal process when the distinction between actor and character blurs (producing the ""actorrole""), subconscious behavior takes the lead, and the actor feels fully present in the dramatic moment. He stressed the importance to achieving this state of a focus on action (""What would I do if..."") rather than emotion (""How would I feel if...""): ""You must ask the kinds of questions that lead to dynamic action."" Instead of forcing emotion, he explained, actors should notice what is happening, attend to their relationships with the other actors, and try to understand ""through the senses"" the fictional world that surrounds them. When he prepared for his role in Pushkin's Mozart and Salieri, Stanislavski created a biography for Salieri in which he imagined the character's memories of each incident mentioned in the play, his relationships with the other people involved, and the circumstances that had impacted on Salieri's life. When he attempted to render all of this detail in performance, however, the subtext overwhelmed the text; overladen with heavy pauses, Pushkin's verse was fragmented to the point of incomprehensibility. His struggles with this role prompted him to attend more closely to the structure and dynamics of language in drama; to that end, he studied Serge Wolkonsky's The Expressive Word (1913). The French theatre practitioner Jacques Copeau contacted Stanislavski in October 1916. As a result of his conversations with Edward Gordon Craig, Copeau had come to believe that his work at the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier shared a common approach with Stanislavski's investigations at the MAT. On 30 December1916, Stanislavski's assistant and closest friend, Leopold Sulerzhitsky, died from chronic nephritis. Reflecting on their relationship in 1931, Stanislavski said that Suler had understood him completely and that no one, since, had replaced him. Stanislavski welcomed the February Revolution of 1917 and its overthrow of the absolute monarchy as a ""miraculous liberation of Russia"". With the October Revolution later in the year, the MAT closed for a few weeks and the First Studio was occupied by revolutionaries. Stanislavski thought that the social upheavals presented an opportunity to realize his long-standing ambitions to establish a Russian popular theatre that would provide, as the title of an essay he prepared that year put it, ""The Aesthetic Education of the Popular Masses"". Vladimir Lenin, who became a frequent visitor to the MAT after the revolution, praised Stanislavski as ""a real artist"" and indicated that, in his opinion, Stanislavski's approach was ""the direction the theatre should take."" The revolutions of that year brought about an abrupt change in Stanislavski's finances when his factories were nationalized, which left his wage from the MAT as his only source of income. On 29 August 1918 Stanislavski, along with several others from the MAT, was arrested by the Cheka, though he was released the following day. During the years of the Civil War, Stanislavski concentrated on teaching his system, directing (both at the MAT and its studios), and bringing performances of the classics to new audiences (such as factory workers and the Red Army). Several articles on Stanislavski and his system were published, but none were written by him. On 5 March 1921, Stanislavski was evicted from his large house on Carriage Row, where he had lived since 1903. Following the personal intervention of Lenin (prompted by Anatoly Lunacharsky), Stanislavski was re-housed at 6 Leontievski Lane, not far from the MAT. He was to live there until his death in 1938. On 29 May 1922, Stanislavski's favourite pupil, the director Yevgeny Vakhtangov, died of cancer. In the wake of the temporary withdrawal of the state subsidy to the MAT that came with the New Economic Policy in 1921, Stanislavski and Nemirovich planned a tour to Europe and the US to augment the company's finances. The tour began in Berlin, where Stanislavski arrived on 18 September 1922, and proceeded to Prague, Zagreb, and Paris, where he was welcomed at the station by Jacques Hébertot, Aurélien Lugné-Poë, and Jacques Copeau. In Paris, he also met André Antoine, Louis Jouvet, Isadora Duncan, Firmin Gémier, and Harley Granville-Barker. He discussed with Copeau the possibility of establishing an international theatre studio and attended performances by Ermete Zacconi, whose control of his performance, economic expressivity, and ability both to ""experience"" and ""represent"" the role impressed him. The company sailed to New York City and arrived on 4 January 1923. When reporters asked about their repertoire, Stanislavski explained that ""America wants to see what Europe already knows."" David Belasco, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Feodor Chaliapin attended the opening night performance. Thanks in part to a vigorous publicity campaign that the American producer, Morris Gest, orchestrated, the tour garnered substantial critical praise, although it was not a financial success. As actors (among whom was the young Lee Strasberg) flocked to the performances to learn from the company, the tour made a substantial contribution to the development of American acting. Richard Boleslavsky presented a series of lectures on Stanislavski's system (which were eventually published as Acting: The First Six Lessons in 1933). A performance of Three Sisters on 31 March 1923 concluded the season in New York, after which they travelled to Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston. At the request of a US publisher, Stanislavski reluctantly agreed to write his autobiography, My Life in Art, since his proposals for an account of the system or a history of the MAT and its approach had been rejected. He returned to Europe during the summer where he worked on the book and, in September, began rehearsals for a second tour. The company returned to New York on 7 November and went on to perform in Philadelphia, Boston, New Haven, Hartford, Washington, D.C., Brooklyn, Newark, Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Detroit. On 20 March 1924, Stanislavski met President Calvin Coolidge at the White House. They were introduced by a translator, Elizabeth Hapgood, with whom he would later collaborate on An Actor Prepares. The company left the US on 17 May 1924. On his return to Moscow in August 1924, Stanislavski began with the help of Gurevich to make substantial revisions to his autobiography, in preparation for a definitive Russian-language edition, which was published in September 1926. He continued to act, reprising the role of Astrov in a new production of Uncle Vanya (his performance of which was described as ""staggering""). With Nemirovich away touring with his Music Studio, Stanislavski led the MAT for two years, during which time the company thrived. With a company fully versed in his system, Stanislavski's work on Mikhail Bulgakov's The Days of the Turbins focused on the tempo-rhythm of the production's dramatic structure and the through-lines of action for the individual characters and the play as a whole. ""See everything in terms of action"" he advised them. Aware of the disapproval of Bulgakov felt by the Repertory Committee (Glavrepertkom) of the People's Commissariat for Education, Stanislavski threatened to close the theatre if the play was banned. Despite substantial hostility from the press, the production was a box-office success. In an attempt to render a classic play relevant to a contemporary Soviet audience, Stanislavski re-located the action in his fast and free-flowing production of Pierre Beaumarchais' 18th-century comedy The Marriage of Figaro to pre-Revolutionary France and emphasised the democratic point of view of Figaro and Susanna, in preference to that of the aristocratic Count Almaviva. His working methods contributed innovations to the system: the analysis of scenes in terms of concrete physical tasks and the use of the ""line of the day"" for each character. In preference to the tightly controlled, Meiningen-inspired scoring of the mise en scène with which he had choreographed crowd scenes in his early years, he now worked in terms of broad physical tasks: actors responded truthfully to the circumstances of scenes with sequences of improvised adaptations that attempted to solve concrete, physical problems. For the ""line of the day,"" an actor elaborates in detail the events that supposedly occur to the character ""off-stage"", in order to form a continuum of experience (the ""line"" of the character's life that day) that helps to justify his or her behaviour ""on-stage"". This means that the actor develops a relationship to where (as a character) he has just come from and to where he intends to go when leaving the scene. The production was a great success, garnering ten curtain calls on opening night. Thanks to its cohesive unity and rhythmic qualities, it is recognised as one of Stanislavski's major achievements. With a performance of extracts from its major productions—including the first act of Three Sisters in which Stanislavski played Vershinin—the MAT celebrated its 30-year jubilee on 29 October 1928. While performing Stanislavski suffered a massive heart-attack, although he continued until the curtain call, after which he collapsed. With that, his acting career came to an end. While on holiday in August 1926, Stanislavski began to develop what would become An Actor's Work, his manual for actors written in the form of a fictional student's diary. Ideally, Stanislavski felt, it would consist of two volumes: the first would detail the actor's inner experiencing and outer, physical embodiment; the second would address rehearsal processes. Since the Soviet publishers used a format that would have made the first volume unwieldy, however, in practice this became three volumes—inner experiencing, outer characterisation, and rehearsal—each of which would be published separately, as it became ready. The danger that such an arrangement would obscure the mutual interdependence of these parts in the system as a whole would be avoided, Stanislavski hoped, by means of an initial overview that would stress their integration in his psycho-physical approach; as it turned out, however, he never wrote the overview and many English-language readers came to confuse the first volume on psychological processes—published in a heavily abridged version in the US as An Actor Prepares (1936)—with the system as a whole. The two editors—Hapgood with the American edition and Gurevich with the Russian—made conflicting demands on Stanislavski. Gurevich became increasingly concerned that splitting An Actor's Work into two books would not only encourage misunderstandings of the unity and mutual implication of the psychological and physical aspects of the system, but would also give its Soviet critics grounds on which to attack it: ""to accuse you of dualism, spiritualism, idealism, etc."" Frustrated with Stanislavski's tendency to tinker with details in preference to addressing more important missing sections, in May 1932 she terminated her involvement. Hapgood echoed Gurevich's frustration. In 1933, Stanislavski worked on the second half of An Actor's Work. By 1935, a version of the first volume was ready for publication in America, to which the publishers made significant abridgements. A significantly different and far more complete Russian edition, An Actor's Work on Himself, Part I, was not published until 1938, just after Stanislavski's death. The second part of An Actor's Work on Himself was published in the Soviet Union in 1948; an English-language variant, Building a Character, was published a year later. The third volume, An Actor's Work on a Role, was published in the Soviet Union in 1957; its nearest English-language equivalent, Creating a Role, was published in 1961. The differences between the Russian and English-language editions of volumes two and three were even greater than those of the first volume. In 2008, an English-language translation of the complete Russian edition of An Actor's Work was published, with one of An Actor's Work on a Role following in 2010. While recuperating in Nice at the end of 1929, Stanislavski began a production plan for Shakespeare's Othello. Hoping to use this as the basis for An Actor's Work on a Role, his plan offers the earliest exposition of the rehearsal process that became known as his Method of Physical Action. He first explored this approach practically in his work on Three Sisters and Carmen in 1934 and Molière in 1935. In contrast to his earlier method of working on a play—which involved extensive readings and analysis around a table before any attempt to physicalise its action—Stanislavski now encouraged his actors to explore the action through its ""active analysis"". He felt that too much discussion in the early stages of rehearsal confused and inhibited the actors. Instead, focusing on the simplest physical actions, they improvised the sequence of dramatic situations given in the play. ""The best analysis of a play"", he argued, ""is to take action in the given circumstances."" If the actor justified and committed to the truth of the actions (which are easier to shape and control than emotional responses), Stanislavski reasoned, they would evoke truthful thoughts and feelings. Stanislavski's attitude to the use of emotion memory in rehearsals (as distinct from its use in actor training) had shifted over the years. Ideally, he felt, an instinctive identification with a character's situation should arouse an emotional response. The use of emotion memory in lieu of that had demonstrated a propensity for encouraging self-indulgence or hysteria in the actor. Its direct approach to feeling, Stanislavski felt, more often produced a block than the desired expression. Instead, an indirect approach to the subconscious via a focus on actions (supported by a commitment to the given circumstances and imaginative ""Magic Ifs"") was a more reliable means of luring the appropriate emotional response. This shift in approach corresponded both with an increased attention to the structure and dynamic of the play as a whole and with a greater prominence given to the distinction between the planning of a role and its performance. In performance the actor is aware of only one step at a time, Stanislavski reasoned, but this focus risks the loss of the overall dynamic of a role in the welter of moment-to-moment detail. Consequently, the actor must also adopt a different point of view in order to plan the role in relation to its dramatic structure; this might involve adjusting the performance by holding back at certain moments and playing full out at others. A sense of the whole thereby informs the playing of each episode. Borrowing a term from Henry Irving, Stanislavski called this the ""perspective of the role"". Every afternoon for five weeks during the summer of 1934 in Paris, Stanislavski worked with the American actress Stella Adler, who had sought his assistance with the blocks she had confronted in her performances. Given the emphasis that emotion memory had received in New York City, Adler was surprised to find that Stanislavski rejected the technique except as a last resort. The news that this was Stanislavski's approach would have significant repercussions in the US; Lee Strasberg angrily rejected it and refused to modify his version of the system. Following his heart attack in 1928, for the last decade of his life Stanislavski conducted most of his work writing, directing rehearsals, and teaching in his home on Leontievski Lane. In line with Joseph Stalin's policy of ""isolation and preservation"" towards certain internationally famous cultural figures, Stanislavski lived in a state of internal exile in Moscow. This protected him from the worst excesses of Stalin's ""Great Terror"". A number of articles critical of the terminology of Stanislavski's system appeared in the run-up to a RAPP conference in early 1931, at which the attacks continued. The system stood accused of philosophical idealism, of a-historicism, of disguising social and political problems under ethical and moral terms, and of ""biological psychologism"" (or ""the suggestion of fixed qualities in nature""). In the wake of the first congress of the USSR Union of Writers (chaired by Maxim Gorky in August 1934), however, Socialist realism was established as the official party line in aesthetic matters. While the new policy would have disastrous consequences for the Soviet avant-garde, the MAT and Stanislavski's system were enthroned as exemplary models. Given the difficulties he had with completing his manual for actors, Stanislavski decided that he needed to found a new studio if he was to ensure his legacy. ""Our school will produce not just individuals,"" he wrote, ""but a whole company"". In June 1935, he began to instruct a group of teachers in the training techniques of the system and the rehearsal processes of the Method of Physical Action. Twenty students (out of 3,500 auditionees) were accepted for the dramatic section of the Opera-Dramatic Studio, where classes began on 15 November. Stanislavski arranged a curriculum of four years of study that focused exclusively on technique and method—two years of the work detailed later in An Actor's Work and two of that in An Actor's Work on a Role. Once the students were acquainted with the training techniques of the first two years, Stanislavski selected Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet for their work on roles. He worked with the students in March and April 1937, focusing on their sequences of physical actions, on establishing their through-lines of action, and on rehearsing scenes anew in terms of the actors' tasks. By June 1938 the students were ready for their first public showing, at which they performed a selection of scenes to a small number of spectators. The Opera-Dramatic Studio embodied the most complete implementation of the training exercises that Stanislavski described in his manuals. From late 1936 onwards, Stanislavski began to meet regularly with Vsevolod Meyerhold, with whom he discussed the possibility of developing a common theatrical language. In 1938, they made plans to work together on a production and discussed a synthesis of Stanislavski's Method of Physical Action and Meyerhold's biomechanical training. On 8 March, Meyerhold took over the rehearsals for Rigoletto, the staging of which he completed after Stanislavski's death. On his death-bed Stanislavski declared to Yuri Bakhrushin that Meyerhold was ""my sole heir in the theatre—here or anywhere else"". Stalin's police tortured and killed Meyerhold in February 1940. Stanislavski died in his home at 3:45pm on 7 August 1938, having probably suffered another heart-attack five days earlier. Thousands of people attended his funeral. Three weeks after his death his widow, Lilina, received an advanced copy of the Russian-language edition of the first volume of An Actor's Work—the ""labour of his life"", as she called it. Stanislavski was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow, not far from the grave of Anton Chekhov.",Normal

"Broad Street – Davis Park Historic District is a historic district in the borough of Danielson, in the town of Killingly, Connecticut. The district is mainly residential in character, and includes Davis Park, a 1.9-acre (0.77ha) triangular park created in 1890 and bounded by Main, Reynolds, and Broad Streets. The district as a whole is 30 acres (12ha) in size. It includes examples of StickEastlake, Queen Anne, and Colonial Revival architectural styles and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. It includes 95 contributing buildings, one contributing site, and four contributing objects. The district is significant for its architecture, which includes many examples of Victorian architecture with rich detailing. The buildings in the district also reflect the institutions and people responsible with the development of Danielson. The town's growth began in 1809, when brothers James and Hezekiah Danielson built a cotton spinning mill. The house of Hezekiah, built about 1825, is the oldest building in the district. The village's growth was further fueled by other textile mills, the completion of the Norwich and Worcester Railroad through town in 1830, the establishment of other businesses, and the expansion of the textile mills from the 1850s onward. The houses in the Broad Street-Davis Park area were built by middle and upper-class residents, who chose the latest architectural styles and built large houses.

"Walter Mackintosh Geddes (November 13, 1885 – November 7, 1915) was an American businessman who was an important witness to the Armenian genocide. His reports provide a detailed account of the situation of the Armenian deportees in the Syrian Desert. While in Aleppo, he witnessed thousands die of exposure and starvation. Greatly saddened and affected by the scenes he witnessed, he ultimately committed suicide on November 7, 1915. Geddes was born on November 13, 1885, in Newark, New Jersey, to Alexander Geddes and Susan Isabel Geddes (née Baker). His father was of Scottish descent and his mother was of English descent. He studied at Stevens Institute of Technology for a year and then spent five years in Saskatchewan, Canada and Montana where he traveled. He graduated from Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University in 1911 and married Rebekah Virginia Botsford on October 13, 1912, in Denver, Colorado. In 1912 he became a solicitor for Peters, Byrne & Company who were tree surgeons in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1913 he and his wife moved to Asia Minor as a result of his decision to join the licorice business which his father had already established. Their son, George Baker Geddes, was born in Damascus. Geddes left for the Ottoman Empire in March 1913 in search of licorice root to expand his business. Having learned Arabic in order to conduct business locally, he left for Aleppo on September 16, 1915. After first passing an encampment of Armenians at Afyonkarahisar, he went to Konia where he witnessed the separation of a woman and her baby from her husband. The husband was then placed on a train while the woman was ""forcibly held behind and kept from getting on the train"". None of these people have any idea where they are going or why they are being exiled. They go day after day along the road with the hope that they may somewhere reach a place where they may be allowed to rest. I saw several old men carrying on their backs the tools of their trade, probably with the hope that they may some day settle down somewhere. The road over the Taurus Mountains in places is most difficult and often times crude conveyances drawn by buffalos, oxen and milk-cows are unable to make the grade and are abandoned and overturned by the gendarmes into the ravine below. The animals are turned loose. I saw several carts, piled high with baggage on the top of which were many Armenians, break down and throw their occupants in the road. One of the drivers, who was a Turk, and who had collected an advance from the people whom he was driving, considered it a huge joke when one woman broke her leg from such a fall. —Walter M. Geddes reporting about the situation of the deportees On arrival in Aleppo, Geddes notes that the situation of the Armenians was ""beyond description"" and that they were ""dying by the hundreds a day"". He then describes the situation of the British Consulate filled with exiles, saying that ""the dead were removed almost every hour"" and adding that ""coffin-makers throughout the city were working late into the night, making rough boxes for the dead whose relatives or friends could afford to give them decent burial"". Geddes, who left Aleppo and arrived in Damascus, writes that, ""several Turks whom I interviewed, told me that the motive of this exile was to exterminate the race"". He added that he did not see ""any Moslem giving alms to Armenians, it being considered a criminal offence for anyone to aid them"". He stated that the situation in Damascus was similar to the situation in Aleppo where hundreds of Armenians were also dying every day. He added that from Damascus, the Armenians were ""sent still farther south into the Hauran, where their fate is unknown"". On October 26, 1915, Geddes left Aleppo and headed for Smyrna and passed through Bozanti. He describes the situation near Bozanti as follows: There seems to be no end to the caravan which moves over the mountain ridge from Bozanti south; throughout the day from sunrise to sunset, the road as far as one can see is crowded with these exiles. Just outside of Tarsus I saw a dead woman lying by the roadside and farther on passed two more dead women, one of whom was being carried by two gendarmes away from the roadside to be buried. Her legs and arms were so emaciated that the bones were nearly through her flesh and her face was swollen and purple from exposure. Farther along, I saw two gendarmes carrying a dead child between them away from the road where they had dug a grave. Many of these soldiers and gendarmes who follow the caravan have spades and as soon as an Armenian dies they take the corpse away from the roadside and bury it. Geddes also writes about his encounter with a woman who had been in Bozanti for two days and had been unable to eat anything except what travelers had given her: At many places like Bozanti, for example, where there is an encampment of Turkish soldiers, there is not enough bread for these Armenians and only two hours from Bozanti I met a woman who was crying for bread. She told me that she had been in Bozanti for two days and was unable to obtain anything to eat, except what travelers like myself had given her. Many of the beasts of burden belonging to the Armenians die of starvation. It is not an unusual sight to see an Armenian removing a pack from the dead animal and putting it on his own shoulders. Many Armenians told me that although they were allowed to rest at night, they get no sleep because of the pangs of hunger and cold. Geddes continues to write about the circumstances of families and children: Diseases broke out in several places along the road, and in Aleppo several cases of typhus fever among the Armenians were reported when I left. Many families have been separated, the men being sent in one direction and the women and children in another. I saw one woman, who was with child, lying in the middle of the road crying, and over her stood a gendarme threatening her if she did not get up and walk. Many children are born along the way and most of these die as their mothers have no nourishment for them. Geddes concludes that ""the sights that I saw on my return trip were worse than those on my trip going"". George Horton, American Consul General in Smyrna, reported the death of Geddes to the State Department of the United States: Mr. Geddes committed suicide by shooting himself through the head with a revolver at his room in the Kraemer Hotel of this city early on the morning of the 7th November 1915. He was seen by myself and others on the preceding afternoon and was perfectly sane and natural in his behaviour and manner of talking giving no indication that he contemplated taking away his life. It is the opinion of those who knew him best here that certain experiences which he has passed through since he has been in Turkey preyed heavily upon his mind. He was dragged from his horse at Alexandretta in the month of October 1914 by Turkish soldiers, beaten and otherwise maltreated and thrown into prison. Just recently in returning from Aleppo, he passed for days through the scenes which are resulting from the measures which are being taken against the Armenians by the Turkish Authorities. It was noticed that he was greatly changed and saddened on his return from Aleppo. In dictating to the stenographer of the Consulate General an account of what he saw, he broke down several times. He was particularly affected in speaking of the sufferings and deaths of the children who were perishing in thousands. He was survived by his wife and their son, who had returned to the United States at the outbreak of World War I.",Normal

"Tremella fimetaria Schum. (1803) Helicobasidium fimetarium (Schum.) Boud. (1887) Exobasidium fimetarium (Schum.) Lapl. (1894) Platygloea fimetaria (Schum.) Höhn. (1917) Achroomyces fimetaria (Schum.) Wojewoda (1977) Jola lasioboli Lagerh. (1898) Cystobasidium lasioboli (Lagerh.) Neuhoff (1924) Platygloea fimicola J. Schröt. (1889) Achroomyces fimicola (J. Schröt.) Mig. (1910) Cystobasidium fimetarium is a species of fungus in the order Cystobasidiales. It is a fungal parasite forming small gelatinous basidiocarps (fruit bodies) on various ascomycetous fungi (including Lasiobolus and Thelebolus spp) on dung. Microscopically, it has auricularioid (laterally septate) basidia producing basidiospores that germinate by budding off yeast cells. The species is known from Europe and North America. The species was originally described in 1803 on cow dung by Danish biologist Heinrich Schumacher who assigned it to Tremella, a genus then used for almost any fungus with gelatinous fruit bodies. In 1887 French mycologist Émile Boudier refound the species on goat dung in France and, discovering that it had auricularioid basidia (unlike Tremella species), transferred it to the auricularioid genus Helicobasidium. In 1889, German mycologist Joseph Schröter described Platygloea fimicola as a new auricularioid species on rabbit dung from modern-day Poland. In 1898 Swedish mycologist Gustaf Lagerheim described Jola lasioboli as a new auricularioid species on cow dung from Norway. In 1924, German mycologist Walther Neuhoff transferred the latter species to his new genus Cystobasidium, based on the swollen, cyst-like probasidia from which the basidia emerge. In 1999, British mycologist Peter Roberts noted that all these appeared to represent the same species and that Tremella fimetaria was the earliest name. Accordingly, he proposed the new combination Cystobasidium fimetarium for the species. Molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, has confirmed that the species is distinct and not closely related to other auricularioid fungi. Basidiocarps are waxy-gelatinous, disc-shaped to irregularly pustular, pale pinkish lilac, 1–4mm in diameter. Microscopically, the hyphae are occasionally clamped, 1.5 to 3 μm wide, producing occasional haustorial cells that attach to host hyphae. Basidia emerge from swollen probasidia; they are tubular, often recurved, 25-55 x 3-4 μm long, and laterally septate, forming four cells. Basidiospores are hyaline, smooth, and ellipsoid to slightly fusoid, measuring 6–11.5 x 3-5 μm; they germinate by budding off subglobose to ovoid yeast cells that form pinkish colonies in culture. Cystobasidium fimetarium is a parasite of ascomycetous fungi on dung, including species of Lasiobolus and Thelebolus. It is known from Europe (Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, and Sweden) and North America (Canada) but has rarely been encountered. The only known British collection is on Thelebolus crustaceus from grouse dung in Scotland.",Normal

"Jon Olav Hjelde (born 30 July 1972) is a Norwegian former professional footballer who played as a central defender. Born in Levanger, Hjelde began his career at his local team Vuku, which competed in the Norwegian Third Division. He joined Rosenborg in 1994, becoming backup to the team's regular central defenders Erik Hoftun and Bjørn Otto Bragstad. Despite not being a regular in the Rosenborg side, he played in the club's historic 1996–97 UEFA Champions League group-stage win over A.C. Milan at the San Siro that eliminated the Italians, and featured in the quarter-final first-leg draw against previous-season Champions League winners Juventus. The two performances caused the squad to be nicknamed the ""Heroes of Milan"", and scouts from across Europe became interested in Rosenborg players, including Hjelde. Although Italian club Bari attempted to sign Hjelde in 1997, he instead accepted a late offer from Nottingham Forest. He soon became a regular in Forest's first-team, where he played for six seasons. Hjelde moved to South Korea in 2003 to join former Asian Club Championship and Afro-Asian Club Championship winners Busan I'cons, despite interest from Stoke City manager Tony Pulis. Busan had once been a dominant K League side, but due to a change in ownership ahead of the 2000 season, triggered by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the club suffered from a reduced budget. Busan manager Ian Porterfield, famous during his earlier playing career for scoring the winning goal of the 1973 FA Cup Final, signed three out-of-contract players from English football in mid-2003, including Hjelde. Hjelde played the latter-half of the 2003 K League season for Busan, but didn't feature in the 2004 season due to a knee injury, and was released by Busan in mid-2004. Hjelde's time playing in South Korea is documented in the book, Who Ate All the Squid?: Football Adventures in South Korea. He rejoined Forest after one year in Korea, but played only sporadically and was released at the end of the 2004–05 season. At this point, Hjelde considered moving back to Norway, but instead signed a one-year deal with Forest's lower-league neighbours Mansfield Town in the summer of 2005. He played regularly for the Stags, forming a defensive team alongside Alex Baptiste. Hjelde indicated that he would move back to Norway at the end of the 2005–06 season, but later changed his mind, and signed a new one-year contract with the Stags.

"Raniero Capocci, also known as Ranieri, Rainerio da Viterbo (c. 1180-1190 – 27 May 1250) was an Italian cardinal and military leader, a fierce adversary of emperor Frederick II. Capocci was born at Viterbo in 1180–1190. Few details exist about his early life, and his alleged adherence to the Cistercian Order, including the role of abbot in the Tre Fontane Abbey in Rome, is unconfirmed. He entered the Roman curia before 1215, the year in which Pope Innocent III sent him to the Abbey of Montecassino to investigate about abbot Adenulf's tenure. In 1216 Capocci was created cardinal deacon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, and later became papal legate to Lombardy. Innocent's successor, Honorius III, appointed Capocci as rector of the Duchy of Spoleto, and later of the areas of Assisi, Nocera Umbra and Gubbio. In 1231 he became cardinal protodeacon. In 1234 the new pope Gregory IX named Capocci rector of Tuscia, as well as capitano (commander) of the Papal troops. In the same year Luca Savelli, grandson of Honorius III, forced the pope to flee from Rome to Umbria. Emperor (and King of Naples and Sicily) Frederick II moved from southern Italy with an army to help Gregory, joining Capocci's troops at Montefiascone. Savelli's army was besieged in a fortress a few kilometers south of Viterbo and, although Frederick left the siege in advance, Capocci was able to defeat them. Frederick's ambiguous behaviour led to his excommunication by Gregory four years later, and Capocci defended the pope's move with a series of letters and treatises disseminated throughout Europe, including the manifesto Ascendit de mari. When Gregory died in 1241, Capocci was jailed by the Roman senator Matteo Rosso Orsini in the Septizodium. After the short reign of Celestine IV (17 days), Ranieri supported the election of a pope who would not show any compromise with Frederick II. The new pope was the Genoese Innocent IV, who would continue Gregory's anti-imperial policy. This is manifest in the events leading to the siege of Viterbo, in which Capocci was instrumental in the expulsion of the imperial garrison from the city, and in the following defeat of the rescue army led by Frederick in person. Capocci was left in the city as papal legate with full powers (he was also bishop of Viterbo for one year). In 1244 a peace treaty was signed between Innocent and Frederick. However, the latter soon began military and diplomatic moves to overthrow the pope, who decided to take refuge in Lyon, leaving Capocci as his plenipotentiary in Italy. When the news arrived that a compromise with the emperor was likely, he had a series of pamphlets, full of insults and accusations of heresy against Frederick, published in the French city: their success among the prelates in the First Council of Lyon led to the deposition of the Sicilian leader (1245). Frederick replied by re-conquering Viterbo, although Capocci was able to gain back most of Umbria and the March of Ancona, including Iesi, the emperor's birthplace. In 1246 Innocent appointed him as papal legate also in the Kingdom of Sicily. In October 1249, however, Innocent started to consider Capocci's power as excessive, and called him back to the Roman curia. Ranieri never accepted the decision and, now ill, moved to Lyon, where he died in 1250. He was initially buried in the Abbey of Citeaux, but later his remains were transferred to the church of Santa Maria in Gradi at Viterbo, which he had built in 1217–1221 as a gift to his personal friend, Saint Dominic.",Normal
"William Inglis is a Toronto Island ferry operated by the Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division of the City of Toronto government (City of Toronto). The ferry serves the Toronto Islands from a dock at Jack Layton Ferry Terminal in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It entered service in 1935, initially known as the ""Shamrock"". The ferry was built by John Inglis and Company. It was the first of three ferries built, to replace the aged ferries the City of Toronto inherited when it took over ferry operations from private industry. Initially, responsibility for operating a ferry service was assigned to the Toronto Transportation Commission. It is now operated by the Parks Division. After the death of Toronto industrialist William Inglis, who headed John Inglis and Company, in November 1935, the ferry was renamed in his honour by the Toronto City Council. Inglis also served as the president of the Canadian National Exhibition and was one of the governors of Toronto Western Hospital. In August 1948, the William Inglis participated in the saving of 12 persons, whose racing sloop had capsized in Toronto Harbour. Three of the twelve clinging to the mast were brought aboard the ferry before speedboats arrived from the John St. Lifesaving Station and recovered the others. In 2012, the boat's engine and bulkhead were updated. Although the boat was exempt from 2012 safety regulations under a ""grandfather clause"", the modernization invalidated the grandfather provision. In order to continue operating, the ferry's passenger capacity was reduced. In October 2012, Toronto City Council decided that funds should be set aside to replace William Inglis, and its two fleet-mates, Thomas Rennie and Sam McBride, with new vessels. In December 2013, the ferry had to be taken out of service to repair a leak in its hull. In its absence, island ferry service to Ward's Island was disrupted.",Normal

"In Malaysian, Bruneian and Indonesian folklore, Bunian people or Orang bunian (Indonesian pronunciation: ) are supernatural beings said to be invisible to most humans, except those with ""spiritual sight"". While the term is often translated as ""elves"", it literally translates to ""hidden people"" or ""whistling people"". Orang bunian are described as beautiful, dressed in ancient Southeast Asian style, and nearly identical to humans in appearance. Some mythological accounts describe the lack of a philtrum. Modern depictions of Orang bunian deviate from the traditional folklore by including elf-like features, pointed ears, high fantasy-influenced attire, or modern Minangkabau long coat clothing. Orang bunian are said to inhabit the deep forests or high mountains in Malay Peninsula, Sumatra & Borneo, far from human contact, as well as near human communities, and are even said to share the same houses as human families. According to legend, their social structure is similar to that of humans in the ancient Malay Peninsula, with families, clans, and royalty. As with other mythical beings in Indonesian folklore, Orang bunian often have supernatural powers, and must be appeased with certain rituals and customs before humans are allowed to trespass areas which they inhabit. Orang bunian are generally regarded as benevolent, befriending and assisting humans, particularly magicians (dukun or bomoh) and shamans (pawang). They are said to be able to intermarry with humans and bear invisible children. According to some tales, men had married Orang bunian women but later decided to leave the bunian community and return to the families they had left behind. However, after returning to human society, they found that many years had passed and everyone they once knew had died. These narratives have been compared to Urashima Taro and Rip Van Winkle.",Normal
"Adrar (Berber: Adrar, ⴰⴷⵔⴰⵔ; Arabic: أدرار) is the administrative capital of Adrar Province, the second largest province in Algeria. The commune is sited around an oasis in the Touat region of the Sahara Desert. According to a 2008 census it has a population of 64,781, up from 43,903 in 1998, with an annual growth rate of 4.0%. Adrar is mainly an agricultural town, characterized by its traditional irrigation system, the Foggara. Adrar lies at an elevation of 258 metres (846ft) above sea level. A large oasis lies to the southwest of the town; this oasis lies in the Tuat region, a string of oases running from Bouda in the north to Reggane in the south. A vast area of sand dunes, the Erg Chech, lies to the west, while a large rocky plateau, the Tademaït, lies to the east. Adrar has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), with long, hot summers and short, warm winters, and averages just 15 millimetres (0.59in) of rainfall per year. Summer temperatures are consistently high as they commonly approach 40 °C (106 °F). temperatures at night are still hot at around 27°C (81°F). Even in early May or in late September, daytime temperatures can rise to 45°C (113°F). Adrar experiences the same kind of desert heat as Death Valley, California during summertime. Winter nights can be chilly and frost is by no means unknown but the days are pleasantly warm, sunny and dry. During the summer, the Sahara region of Algeria is the source of a scorching, sometimes dusty and southerly wind called the Sirocco. These winds parch the plateaus of northern Algeria up to 40 days and reach the Tell coastal region for as many as 20 days. The settlement in the region (also known as Touat) is quite ancient and the area provides for several different cultures and includes several historic monuments. This intermingling gave birth to a body of traditions and of cultural and hand-crafted practices that are still present today in the life of its inhabitants, translating into a wealth of the folklore and cultural heritage. Touat Cheikh Sidi Mohamed Belkebir Airport (or simply Adrar Airport) is located 10 kilometers away from center of the city.

"Coffee Creek Correctional Facility is a women's prison and prisoner intake center in Wilsonville, Oregon, United States. Operated by the Oregon Department of Corrections, the 1,684-bed facility opened in 2001 at a 108-acre (0.44km2) campus. The selection of the location for the prison was controversial and included legal challenges. The minimum and medium security facility operates several programs designed to teach skills to inmates. Coffee Creek is the only women's prison in Oregon. Female state death row inmates in Oregon are designated to be held in this facility. Oregon needed to build a new women's prison and prisoner intake facility due to the increased demand for prison space created with the passage of Ballot Measure 11 in 1994 that imposed mandatory minimum sentences for certain crimes. The new prison was also designed to replace the 200-bed Oregon Women's Correctional Center in Salem. Originally, the plan called for building the prison in Salem, but lawmakers and politicians there successfully pushed to build it elsewhere. State officials planned on building the prison at the site of the closed Dammasch State Hospital in Wilsonville, but later selected a 108-acre (0.44km2) site at the north end of Wilsonville in Washington County. The process involved protracted battles over two legislative sessions and was settled when Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber signed a bill into law. Groundbreaking on the complex was held on April 21, 2000. A final challenge to the location was rejected by the Oregon Supreme Court in September 2000. The former site selected at the former state hospital became the Villebois housing development. In October 2001, Coffee Creek's minimum security wing opened, followed by the medium security wing and inmate intake center in April 2002 at the $171 million complex. Delayed by three years due to the siting issue, the prison was officially dedicated in April 2002. The construction project was an honorable mention in 2002 as the top public project in Oregon by Northwest Construction magazine. DLR Group designed the prison, and Hoffman Construction Company built the facility. Within a year of opening, the inmate population reached 1,015. In August 2003, Coffee Creek had to install portable bathrooms for a day after mechanical problems prevented bathrooms from functioning properly. From 2004 to 2006, several corrections officers were removed after accusations of sexual misconduct, with one victim reaching a settlement of $350,000 with the state. In 2006, an additional 108 beds were added to the prison, with plans to add about 200 more by the year 2011. Nancy Howton was named the superintendent of Coffee Creek in November 2007. Built at a cost of $110 million, the 1,684-bed prison sits on 108 acres (0.44km2) and contains 425,000 square feet (39,500m2). Coffee Creek's prisoner intake facility process approximately 450 inmates per month. Incoming prisoners are screened and ranked based on factors such as behavior, age, health, criminal history, and psychological health while housed in the 432-bed intake center. Despite being a women's prison, the complex houses prisoners of both sexes. Coffee Creek is Oregon's only women's prison, and was originally built with 820 beds for female inmates. The intake process takes 30 days before male prisoners are assigned to other prisons in the state's system. Coffee Creek contains both minimum security and medium security units. Other units are used for intensive management, drug and alcohol rehab, psychiatric treatment, medical treatment, and disciplinary segregation. A total of 450 officers are assigned to Coffee Creek. Since the complex opened, the Oregon Department of Corrections has operated the Parenting Inside Out program designed to teach parenting skills to mothers behind bars. With nearly two-thirds of inmates also mothers, Coffee Creek runs several other programs focused on mothers and the children of inmates. One job program at the prison trains prisoners to refurbish reading glasses donated to the Lions Club, which are then given away in Mexico. The Oregon Department of Transportation through its DMV division operates a call center inside the prison. The Coffee Creek Quilters is an inmate program that teaches quilting. They also have a garden used by inmates to raise crops. As of 2011, the prison has a single cell for its death row. Notable criminals held at the facility include:",Normal

"Erich Christian Wilhelm Martini (19 March 1880 – 5 December 1960) was a German physician, zoologist and malariologist. A staunch supporter of the Nazi Party, he studied typhus and malaria vectors. He served as a director of the entomology department of the Ship and Tropical Diseases Institute in Hamburg. It has been claimed that he may have been involved in biological warfare experiments to spread malaria on the Pontine marshes of Italy. Martini was born in Rostock, son of Carl (1845-1907) who was a regional court president and Agnes (Caroline Christina) née Kessler (1855-1881). Educated at Rostock and Schwerin, he went to study medicine at the universities at Rostock, Tübingen and Munich, graduating in 1905. He then received a doctorate from Rostock under Oswald Seeliger (1889-1907) on nematode development. He habilitated in 1908 at the University of Rostock. In 1912 he joined the institute for tropical medicine in Hamburg. In 1913-14 he visited the United States. During World War I he served as a physician on the eastern front, dealing with typhus and malaria. He examined the difference in typhus mortality among Christians and Jews. He later suggested that Jews were the primary victims and the spreaders of the disease. In 1919 he became director of the department of entomology at the Hamburg institute. Martini joined the NSDAP in September 1933 and also became a member of the National Socialist lecturers' association. In 1940 he became a staff physician and teacher at the Military Medical Academy in Berlin. When Heinrich Himmler set up an entomological institute under the Ahnenerbe, Martini and Peter Mühlens were proposed as a director by Wolfram Sievers. Himmler had reservations against those trained as physicians and sought a zoologist, finally appointing Eduard May (1905–1956) but Martini was made a member of the advisory board. In 1938 he presided over the seventh International Entomological Congress held in Berlin. In 1943, following the fall of Mussolini, Germany was treated as an enemy. Himmler is thought to have sought Martini's assistance in unleashing a malaria epidemic in the Pontine Marshes. The reclamation of the area and the reduction of malaria had been considered an accomplishment under Italian fascism. The Germany army stopped pumps that moved water from the hills into the sea, causing the area to revert to brackish marshland where Anopheles labranchiae could breed again. This led to a massive increase in malaria. Whether this malaria outbreak was intentional as claimed by Yale researcher Frank M. Snowden has been questioned. After World War II, Martini sought relief under denazification and wrote to a former Jewish assistant Otto Hecht hoping for a favorable review. Martini married a colleague Erna Hansen and they had two children. On 2 December 1960, Martini was hit in a street accident and he died three days later. He was buried in Ohlsdorf Cemetery, Hamburg. A mosquito species Anopheles martinius from Uzbekistan was named after Martini by Shingarev in 1926.",Normal

"Lactoris fernandeziana is a flowering shrub endemic to the cloud forest of Masatierra — Robinson Crusoe Island, of the Juan Fernández Islands archipelago of Chile. It is the only extant species in the genus Lactoris. The species is now included in Aristolochiaceae following APG IV (2016). Morphological data are not clear concerning the classification of Lactoris, but molecular data place it in the Aristolochiaceae. In the fossil record, pollen has been found which seems to be related to the living Lactoris species. Lactoris fernandeziana seems to be wind-pollinated. The wild population of about 1000 plants has low genetic diversity, and grows on foggy and rainy slopes, usually as an understory plant but sometimes in full sun. Cultivation of seedlings has generally been unsuccessful, although cuttings have worked better and better knowledge of preferred growing conditions may make cultivation easier.",Normal

"The Courier (known as The Courier & Advertiser between 1926 and 2012) is a newspaper published by DC Thomson in Dundee, Scotland. As of 2013, it is printed in six regional editions: Dundee, Angus & The Mearns, Fife, West Fife, Perthshire, and Stirlingshire. However, by 2020 this had been reduced to three regional editions for Perth and Perthshire; Angus and Dundee and Fife. In the months July to December 2019 the average daily circulation of the Courier was 30,179 copies. Established in 1801 as the Dundee Courier & Argus, the entire front page of The Courier used to contain classified advertisements – a traditional newspaper format for many years. In 1809 it was taken over by Robert Rintoul who used the paper to campaign for political reform, and criticism of local politicians such as Alexander Riddoch. In 1926, during the General Strike The Courier was merged with The Advertiser. From the 10 May to 28 May 1926, the paper adopted the headline-news format of The Advertiser, before reverting to its previous format which it maintained until 1992. The next major change to the newspaper came on 21 January 2012, when it changed to a compact format, having previously existed as a broadsheet.

"DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge, created in 1958, is located along the banks of the Missouri River in the U.S. states of Iowa and Nebraska. The 8,362-acre (3,384ha) refuge (46% in Iowa, 54% in Nebraska) preserves an area that would have been otherwise lost to cultivation. In 1960, an Army Corps of Engineers channelization project on the Missouri River moved the main river channel in the area to the west. The former river channel became DeSoto Lake, a seven-mile long oxbow lake. As a result, part of the Nebraska portion of the refuge lies on the east side of the Missouri River. For over 20 years after construction, the lake was used for recreational boating, with half of the lake designated for watersports and the other half a no-wake zone for wildlife habitat and fishing. The lake was so popular that access was limited by the park's rangers to keep the boat traffic down on the lake on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. The lake's marina, snack bar, swimming area and boat ramps were all removed, and restrictions were placed on boat operation. Today, the refuge is home to around 30 mammal species, including white-tailed deer, beavers, opossums, raccoons, fox squirrels, muskrats and coyotes. Many bird species also inhabit the refuge, such as bald eagles, great blue herons, egrets, pelicans, turkeys and cardinals. The refuge is also a major stopover on the Central Flyway bird migration route; the population of migratory birds increases substantially in the spring and fall months. The numbers of snow geese used to frequently be in the hundreds of thousands, but for unknown reasons has substantially dropped for only a few thousand a year (not at once). The population of Canada geese that stopped at the lake before it was channelized is once again rising. Several miles of nature trails provide access to the varied landscapes of the refuge. Dogs are permitted only under physical restrictive control of a leash at all times. Hunting is allowed in season (for deer, turkey, and pheasant) with a permit and there are several fishing piers along the lake, which are open outside of the bird migration seasons. The refuge also documents the area's human history. In 1865, the sternwheel steamboat Bertrand, bound for the Montana Territory, sank in the Missouri River. The boat and its cargo rested on the river bottom until 1968, when the wreck was rediscovered. Over 500,000 items were excavated from the wreck; many of them were in excellent condition. Catalogue numbers are now in the upper 5000's, each number sometimes only having one related object, or, in the case of nails, tens of thousands. A visitor center in the refuge displays many of these items. The Bertrand site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge is located five miles (eight kilometres) east of Blair, Nebraska. Access to the refuge is on U.S. Route 30 between Blair and Interstate 29.",Normal

Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review stating: ""Not that you'd guess from their casual and carefree attitude on the track. ""I just want all of these girls to be on me, And maybe even one of them could be Beyoncé,"" they cheekily boast over a bounding guitar riff before engaging in some bump 'n' grind with their ""Mama"" on the dancefloor.

"Leytonstone is a London Underground station in Leytonstone in the London Borough of Waltham Forest, east London. It is on the Central line, on the boundary of Zones 3 and 4. Towards Central London, the next station is Leyton, while going east from Leytonstone, the line divides into two branches. On the direct route to Woodford and Epping the next stop is Snaresbrook, and on the Hainault loop it is Wanstead. The station is close to Whipps Cross University Hospital. It is a terminus for some services and returns westbound. The railway line from Loughton Branch Junction (on the Lea Valley line between Stratford and Lea Bridge) to Loughton was built by the Eastern Counties Railway and opened on 22 August 1856. A station at Leytonstone was opened on the same day. In turn it became, from 1862, part of the Great Eastern Railway system and then in 1923 part of the London & North Eastern Railway before being transferred to London Transport in 1947. This formed part of the ""New Works Programme 1935 – 1940"" that was to see major changes at Leytonstone with the station becoming the junction of the existing Loughton-Epping-Ongar line, newly electrified, with the new tube tunnel running under Eastern Avenue towards Newbury Park. This work saw a complete reconstruction of the station along with the removal of the level crossing at Church Lane and its replacement by an underbridge. The work stopped in May 1940 due to wartime priorities; further delays were caused by the station buildings being hit by a German bomb in January 1944. During the war, the new tunnels were used as an aircraft component factory; the part closest to Leytonstone was a public air-raid shelter. The station was first served by the Central line on 5 May 1947, when it became the temporary terminus of the line, passengers changing to steam shuttle onwards to Epping. This ceased on 14 December 1947 with the extension of Underground services to Woodford and Newbury Park.

"The Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region Intercity Railway System (Chinese: 珠江三角洲地區城際軌道交通, abbreviated as PRDIR) is a regional higher-speed rail and suburban rail network being gradually constructed in the Pearl River Delta (Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area), People's Republic of China. The project's goal is to have every major urban center in the Greater Bay Area to be within one-hour travel by rail to Guangzhou. On March 16, 2005, the State Council approved plans for a regional high-speed commuter rail network for the Jingjinji, Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta. According to the plan, by 2020, the network will have a total route mileage of about 600 kilometres (370mi). In September 2009, the plan was expanded to 1,478km (918mi) of routes split up into 23 lines. In the long term vision network length will reach 1,890km (1,170mi) by 2030. By then the network will provide basic coverage to the Pearl River Delta region. The Suishen ICR, Guanhui ICR and Guangfozhao ICR accept Alipay, avoiding the need to purchase tickets in advance. The system currently has seven lines. The Guangzhou–Zhuhai Intercity Railway or Guangzhu Intercity Railway is a 116km dedicated, grade-separated passenger railway linking New Guangzhou Station in Panyu, Guangzhou, and Zhuhai Airport in Zhuhai, via Shunde, Zhongshan and Jiangmen. Operation began in 2011. The Guanhui Intercity Railway or Guanhui Urban Railway is a 14 station, 100km long, regional rapid railway line that connects Dongguan to Huizhou. The line was originally planned to use subway type cars with Siemens technology. However it was plans changed partway through construction to use 8 car CRH6 EMUs capable of running up to 200kmh (120mph). The line started construction in 2009 and was expected to open in late 2013. Construction was completed in June 2013 and test runs began in 2014, but the first segment of the line, from Xiaojinkou-Changping East did not open until 30 March 2016. The Guangfozhao Intercity Railway or Fozhao Urban Railway is an 11 station long regional rapid railway line. It connects Guangzhou to Zhaoqing, via Foshan. Operation began on 30 March 2016. The Guangzhou–Shenzhen Intercity Railway, also known as the Suishen Intercity Railway (Chinese: 穗深城际铁路; pinyin: Suì-Shēn Chéngjì Tiělù) is a 97-kilometre (60mi) regional rapid railway line that runs roughly along the east bank of the Pearl River connecting the major cities of Guangzhou, Dongguan, and Shenzhen. It will use CRH6 EMUs with a top speed of 140kmh (87mph). Operation began on 15 December 2019. The Zhuji Intercity Railway is a high-speed railway connecting Gongbei Subdistrict in Zhuhai with Zhuhai Jinwan Airport via Hengqin. Phase 1 started operation on 18 August 2020. Phase 2 from Zhuhai Changlong to Zhuhai Airport will open in 2023. Foshan–Dongguan Intercity Railway, also called the Foguan Intercity Railway, is a planned high-speed railway within Guangdong province, China between the cities of Foshan, via Guangzhou, to Dongguan. It will connect Panyu District, Guangzhou at the major Guangzhou South interchange, tunnelling under the Pearl River through Machong and Hongmei to Dongguan West providing connections via the Dongguan Rail Transit, the Guangzhou–Shenzhen intercity railway or the Dongguan–Huizhou intercity railway. The length of this railway is 37km (23mi). Ring service around Guangzhou, mostly making use of trackage from other Metropolitan Region Intercity Railway Lines and existing freight railways. A new section under construction, known as the Guangfo Link, is a 35km long railway line that connects Guangzhou South Railway Station to Foshan West Railway Station. It has a top speed of 200 kilometres per hour (120mph) and will use 6 car CRH6 EMUs capable of running up to 2.5-minute frequencies. It is expected to start construction in late 2012 and completed in 2016 or 2017. The Guangqing Intercity Railway is a high-speed railway connecting Guangzhou with Qingyuan. In 2020, with the near completion of the initial batch of lines, the National Development and Reform Commission approved an additional 775km of intercity railway projects. A number of them will start construction before 2022.

"The Cabinet of the Government of Jamaica is the ultimate decision-making body of the executive within the Westminster system of government in traditional constitutional theory. The Cabinet of Jamaica is the principal instrument of government policy. It consists of the Prime Minister, and a minimum of thirteen other Ministers of Government, who must be members of one of the two Houses of Parliament. Not more than four members of the Cabinet may be members of the Senate. The Minister of Finance must be an elected member of the House of Representatives. The Shadow Cabinet of Jamaica is seen as the alternative to the Cabinet of Jamaica, led by the Leader of the Opposition (Jamaica), and is charged with fairly criticizing and providing alternative policy to that proposed by the Government. The Cabinet of Jamaica is currently composed of The Jamaica Labour Party members because the party won the 2020 General elections. The following are the members of the Government Cabinet led by Prime Minister Andrew Holness. The government of Jamaica, formally referred to as His Majesty's Jamaican Government, is defined by the constitution as the King acting on the advice of her Executive Council; what is technically known as the King-in-Council, or sometimes the Governor-in-Council, referring to the governor general as the King's representative. As the stipulations of responsible government require that those who directly advise the monarch and governor general on how to exercise the Royal Prerogative be accountable to the elected House of Representatives, the day-to-day operation of government is guided only by a sub-group of the Cabinet made up of individuals who hold seats in parliament. This body of ministers of the Crown is the Cabinet, which has come to be the council in the phrase King-in-Council. Each minister of the Crown is responsible for the general administration of at least one government portfolio, and heads a corresponding ministry or ministries. The most important minister, following the prime minister, is the Minister of Finance, while other high-profile ministries include foreign affairs, national security, industry and health. Further, the prime minister may recommend the governor general appoint to Cabinet some ministers of state and ministers without portfolio. Ministers of state often assume one responsibility of a ministry and are not considered as a part of the Cabinet. In the Jamaican press, Ministers of State of often referred to as Junior Ministers. Ministers without portfolio, often working within the Office of the prime minister, assuming one of the prime minister's subsidiary roles (excluding that of Minister of Defence). One exception exists within the current Cabinet. Nine ministers of state have been appointed but are not a part of the cabinet although they will help in the operations of their various sectors.",Normal

"In statistics, the observed information, or observed Fisher information, is the negative of the second derivative (the Hessian matrix) of the ""log-likelihood"" (the logarithm of the likelihood function). It is a sample-based version of the Fisher information. Suppose we observe random variables X 1 , … , X n {displaystyle X_{1},ldots ,X_{n}} , independent and identically distributed with density f(X;θ), where θ is a (possibly unknown) vector. Then the log-likelihood of the parameters θ {displaystyle theta } given the data X 1 , … , X n {displaystyle X_{1},ldots ,X_{n}} is We define the observed information matrix at θ ∗ {displaystyle theta ^{*}} as Since the inverse of the information matrix is the asymptotic covariance matrix of the corresponding maximum-likelihood estimator, the observed information is often evaluated at the maximum-likelihood estimate for the purpose of significance testing or confidence-interval construction. The invariance property of maximum-likelihood estimators allows the observed information matrix to be evaluated before being inverted. Andrew Gelman, David Dunson and Donald Rubin define observed information instead in terms of the parameters' posterior probability, p ( θ | y ) {displaystyle p(theta |y)} : I ( θ ) = − d 2 d θ 2 log ⁡ p ( θ | y ) {displaystyle I(theta )=-{frac {d^{2}}{dtheta ^{2}}}log p(theta |y)} The Fisher information I ( θ ) {displaystyle {mathcal {I}}(theta )} is the expected value of the observed information given a single observation X {displaystyle X} distributed according to the hypothetical model with parameter θ {displaystyle theta } : The comparison between the observed information and the expected information remains an active and ongoing area of research and debate. Efron and Hinkley provided a frequentist justification for preferring the observed information to the expected information when employing normal approximations to the distribution of the maximum-likelihood estimator in one-parameter families in the presence of an ancillary statistic that affects the precision of the MLE. Lindsay and Li showed that the observed information matrix gives the minimum mean squared error as an approximation of the true information if an error term of O ( n − 3 2 ) {displaystyle O(n^{-32})} is ignored. In Lindsay and Li's case, the expected information matrix still requires evaluation at the obtained ML estimates, introducing randomness. However, when the construction of confidence intervals is of primary focus, there are reported findings that the expected information outperforms the observed counterpart. Yuan and Spall showed that the expected information outperforms the observed counterpart for confidence-interval constructions of scalar parameters in the mean squared error sense. This finding was later generalized to multiparameter cases, although the claim had been weakened to the expected information matrix performing at least as well as the observed information matrix.",Normal

"Stirton is an unincorporated rural community in Mapleton Township, Wellington County, Ontario, Canada. The Conestogo River flows 0.85km (0.53mi) west of Stirton, and the land between the settlement and the river are part of the Conestogo Lake Conservation Area. Stirton prospered from the mid-1800s to the early 1900s. The settlement was named for David Stirton, a member of the House of Commons from 1857 to 1876. A map of Stirton from the 1850s showed that the settlement had 16 lots. Many were sold between 1856 and 1868. The settlement was divided into two sections, Upper Stirton and Lower Stirton, located about 1km (0.62mi) apart. Mills were located in one section, while merchants and residences were located in the other. A post office operated from 1863 to 1910, and local merchant John Sanderson was the first postmaster. The early settlement also had a blacksmith shop, tannery, cooper, shoe shop, harness maker, general store, carriage maker, two churches, and three carpenters. A flax mill was built in 1867, and employed about 60 people. The Hotel Stirton operated during the late 1860s. In 1871, Stirton was receiving mail daily, and had a population of 150. Many of Stirton's businesses were abandoned by 1900, and the Methodist church in Stirton existed until 1929.

"Various proposals have been considered since the 1980s to extend the franchise in Irish presidential elections to citizens resident outside the state. In 2019, the then government introduced a bill to amend the constitution to facilitate this extension. The bill lapsed in January 2020 when the 32nd Dáil was dissolved for the 2020 general election, but was restored to the order paper in July 2020. At present, the only nonresident voting rights in Ireland are for university constituencies in Seanad Éireann and certain public servants posted abroad. At present, Article 12.2.2º of the Constitution of Ireland reads: Dáil Éireann is the lower house of the Oireachtas (parliament) and Article 16.1.2º of the Constitution states: The relevant law is section 8 of the Electoral Act 1992, which provides that, to be eligible for the electoral register for a given Dáil constituency, one must be: The Electoral Act 1992 is an ordinary act of the Oireachtas which can be amended by a subsequent act of the Oireachtas; the Constitution can be amended by act of the Oireachtas but subject to approval of the electorate at a referendum. Ministerial orders are secondary legislation which the Oireachtas need not approve. It would be possible to give nonresidents the vote in both Dáil and Presidential elections by amending the 1992 act, but limiting the nonresident franchise to Presidential elections would require a constitutional amendment. The Irish diaspora is large and the question of voting rights for emigrants and other expatriates has arisen continually since the 1980s. The Oireachtas committee on the constitution considered the matter in 2002; it recommended no extension of the franchise, but that among the senators nominated by the Taoiseach should be ""a person or persons with an awareness of emigrant issues"". The Constitutional Convention established in 2012 was directed to report on several issues, including ""giving citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in Presidential elections at Irish embassies, or otherwise"". It considered the matter at its plenary meeting on 28–29 September 2013 and recommended allowing expatriate citizens to vote. It made some more detailed discussions, voting as follows: Restrictions: Although the Fine Gael–Labour coalition government was supposed to give an official response in the Dáil within four months of receiving the Convention's report, it was not until January 2016 that Ann Phelan said it was ""committed to undertaking … analysis"" of the ""complex and inter-related issues"" involved in the recommendation. It had already responded in March 2015 to a European Commission communication on ""the consequences of disenfranchisement of Union citizens exercising their right to free movement"", saying ""policy, legal and practical issues"" on diaspora voting should be considered by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs; in October 2015, Paudie Coffey said this work had begun. In 2017 the government formed after the 2016 election accepted the Convention's 2013 recommendation, published a position paper listing seven options for eligibility criteria and associated implementation measures, and promised a constitutional referendum on whichever option it would select, to be held in May 2019 alongside the local elections. The seven options were: In February 2019, the government decided that, due to the urgency of dealing with Brexit, the referendum would be postponed until October; it also agreed that the proposal would be ""an extension of the franchise to all citizens resident outside the State, including citizens resident in Northern Ireland"". The text of the bill was agreed by the cabinet on 11 June, and the Thirty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution (Presidential Elections) Bill 2019 (bill no. 68 of 2019) was introduced in the Dáil by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney on 16 September 2019. The bill proposed to amend the constitution in three places: Irish constitutional amendments require a referendum. The required Referendum Commission was established on 26 September, chaired by High Court judge David Barniville. The 2019 bill lapsed with the dissolution of the 32nd Dáil on 14 January 2020, prior to the general election on 8 February. The election manifestos of Fine Gael and Sinn Féin supported nonresident voting in Presidential elections. It was restored to the order paper in July 2020.",Normal

"Serra da Estrela (Portuguese pronunciation: ) is the highest mountain range in Continental Portugal. Together with the Serra da Lousã it is the westernmost constituent range of the Sistema Central and also one of the highest in the system. It includes mainland Portugal's highest point at 1,993 metres (6,539 feet) above mean sea level (although the summit of Mount Pico in the Portuguese Azores islands is higher). This point is not a distinctive mountain summit, but rather the highest point in a plateau, being known as Torre (""Tower"" in English). Torre is an unusual summit in that it is accessible by a paved road. The peak has a topographic prominence of 1,204m (3,950ft) and its parent peak is Pico Almanzor, in Spain. The mountain range, situated between the municipalities of Seia, Manteigas, Gouveia, Guarda and Covilhã, is about 100 kilometres (60 miles) long and is 30km (19mi) across at its widest point. It is formed from a huge granite ridge that once formed the southern frontier of the country. There are three rivers that have their headwaters in the Serra da Estrela: the Mondego, which is the longest river entirely within Portuguese territory; and the Zêzere, which is a tributary of the Tagus; a tributary of the Mondego, the Alva also has its headwaters in the range. It is 1,691m (5,548ft) high. The mountain range is now part of the Serra da Estrela Natural Park and offers skiing opportunities in the ski resort of Loriga, Seia Municipality. The Cão da Serra da Estrela (Estrela Mountain Dog) is a breed of livestock guardian dog that takes its name from this region. Queijo Serra da Estrela (Serra da Estrela cheese) is a soft cheese from the region of Serra da Estrela. The recipe is more than 2000 years old. It is made from cardoon thistle, raw sheep's milk and salt. The cheese is soft and gooey. The cheese becomes harder and chewier as time goes by. The region's ancient bordaleira sheep are also prized for their wool. The region's cuisine is well-regarded and includes dishes such as breaded sweet sardines and Juniper beef stew. Smoked meat (fumeiro) and traditional sausages (enchidos) are in abundance, the nettle sausage (alheira de urtiga) among them. Though the region has a very small local Jewish population, it has emerged as a center for Kosher food, with local producers launching kosher versions of their olive oil, wine and cheesemakers obtaining kosher certification for some products. 40°21′50.1″N 7°36′39.3″W﻿ ﻿40.363917°N 7.610917°W﻿ 40.363917; -7.610917 The Serra da Estrela is also home to a hydroelectric system of dams, part of which is the Covão dos Conchos. The Covão dos Conchos looks like a natural sinkhole within the lake at first glance, but it was constructed as a spillway in 1955 and acts as a water diversion from Ribeira das Naves to Lagoa Comprida. A legend associated with the mountain is mentioned in chapter 41 of the American literary classic, Moby-Dick: Archaeological investigations have allowed a picture of life during the fifth millennium BC, the Early Neolithic to emerge, where small communities sustained themselves by small game hunting, the gathering of acorn and other winter fruits, and migratory pastoralism. The raising of sheep and goats, introduced to the region by the first Neolithic settlers - suggests that spring and summer were spent on high ground pastures and winter on the lower grounds of the river valleys. The significance of the Serra da Estrela in Neolithic culture can be seen in the discovery that megaliths in the Mondego River basin were predominantly built with an alignment that allowed the mountain range to be seen from within the inner chamber. At the same time the rise of Aldebaran, the brightest star of Taurus, behind the mountains could also be seen and its Heliacal rising in late Aprilearly May could have been used as a temporal marker for the movement to the high pastures of Serra da Estrela. This archaeological narrative closely mirrors the local folklore that explains the name of the mountain range.",Normal
"Alma Kaminiito (アルマカミニイト) was a J-pop and Latin pop music duo based in Japan. It consisted of Eric Fukusaki of Peru and Munehiko Ohno from Japan. The pair released two singles in 2012: its debut ""Akane"" and the double A-side ""Amatsubu Pearl""""Dakishimetai Dakishimetai"". Alma Kamininito released the cover album Alma Covers at the end of the year, which featured Japanese-language songs sung in Spanish and English. It marked the unit's final release following the departure of Ohno in April 2013. Part of the Japanese diaspora in Peru, Erik Fukusaki traveled to Japan at the age of 18 in order to pursue a career in enka. A Japanese native, Munehiko Ohno was a lifelong practitioner of the buyō style of traditional Japanese dance. Citing music duo Chemistry, he took an interest in music at the age of 18. He began taking singing lessons while attending university. In order to gain entrance into Up-Front Works, Fukusaki and Ohno separately auditioned for the record company's Forrest Award in February 2011. Upon their admittance, Up-Front posed the idea of the pair creating a single unit together. Ohno agreed to the proposal the day of his successful audition; after seeking advisement from Alberto Shiroma of the Peruvian ensemble Diamantes and Kazufumi Miyazawa of the Japanese band The Boom, Fukusaki deliberated for two weeks before accepting. In choosing the duo's name, Fukusaki and Ohno were told to write numerous words in Spanish and Japanese onto a paper. Staff of the record company then chose and joined two Spanish words together: ""alma"", meaning ""soul"", and ""caminito"", meaning ""path"". The president of the company decided to change the spelling of the latter to ""kami ni ito"", meaning ""paper"" and ""thread"". Blending J-pop and Latin pop into its music, Alma Kaminiito sought to ""unite Japan with the world"". Prior to its debut, Alma Kaminiito participated in various street performances and appeared as guests at music events. The three songs recorded for Alma Kaminiito's debut single were used for the drama film Share House (2011) preceding its release. A reggae-tinged number, ""Akane"" was released on April 25, 2012. On that day, the duo promoted the single by performing at the Sunshine City building complex in the district of Ikebukuro. In August, the pair held its first concert entitled Alma Kaminiito 1st Live ""Uno"". Alma Kaminiito released the double A-side ""Amatsubu Pearl""""Dakishimetai Dakishimetai"" on October 24 as its second single.

"The Privy Purse is the British sovereign's private income, mostly from the Duchy of Lancaster. This amounted to £20.1 million in net income for the year to 31 March 2018. The Duchy is a landed estate of approximately 46,000 acres (200 square kilometres) held in trust for the sovereign since 1399. It also has 190 miles (310 kilometres) of foreshore. The Duchy was valued at approximately £533 million in 2018. The land is organised into the Lancashire Survey, the Yorkshire Survey, the Crewe Survey, the Needwood Estate and the South Survey. The sovereign is not entitled to the Duchy's capital, but the net revenues of the Duchy are the property of the sovereign in right of the Duchy of Lancaster. While the income is private, the King uses the larger part of it to meet official expenses incurred by other members of the British royal family. Only the King receives payments from Parliament that are not reimbursed by the King. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who is the equivalent of the chairman of the trustees, has for the past several centuries always been a Government minister, although this is not a requirement. The Keeper of the Privy Purse looks after the sovereign's personal financial affairs. His title is derived from the Privy Purse (an embroidered bag borne by the Keeper at a coronation) which contrasts with his Department's present-day use of computers and up-to-date accounting procedures. He manages the revenues which come from the Duchy of Lancaster. The Privy Purse meets both official expenditure incurred by The King as sovereign and private expenditure. In recent years, the office of Keeper has been held jointly with that of Treasurer to the King, who is responsible for the use of the Civil List, funds used to meet official expenditure relating to the King's duties as Head of State. He also oversees the grant-in-aid from the Royal Household for the maintenance of the occupied Royal Palaces and for royal travel. He is also responsible for the property maintenance of the Occupied Royal Palaces (such as Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace) and their gardens, for the financial aspects of royal travel, for personnel matters in the Royal Household, for the King's private estates (which include Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House) and for the commercial activities of the Royal Collection Trust (for which annual accounts are published). In the past, Great Britain's civil government day-to-day costs were paid for by the sovereign under normal circumstances, the monies in this Public Purse being raised from the income of the Crown Estate lands and holdings. Under extraordinary circumstances, namely in time of war or during budget shortfalls, Parliament raised additional monies through taxation. The system was to a large degree self-funding through the Crown's large holdings, taxes being applied only when necessary, and almost always at the risk of public outcry. Taxes were normally very low, and the necessity to go to Parliament to fund wars was an effective check on the monarch's power. As the role of the government increased in the 18th century, the Public Purse was increasingly unable to raise enough to fund the development of the country. In 1760 when George III came to the throne, it was decided that the whole cost of civil government should be provided by Parliament, with the Crown surrendering most of the hereditary revenues (principally the net surplus of the Crown Estate) by the king for the duration of the reign. In this system, Parliament was responsible for the finances of the state, including paying the Crown the Civil List allowance to meet the sovereign's official expenses. In the fiscal year 20072008, the Crown Estate paid the Treasury £211.0 million in return for £7.9 million in Civil List payments to the Queen. In 2012, the Civil List was replaced by the Sovereign Grant, through the Sovereign Grant Act 2011.",Normal

"Reportedly haunted locations: The Society for Psychical Research (SPR) is a nonprofit organisation in the United Kingdom. Its stated purpose is to understand events and abilities commonly described as psychic or paranormal. It describes itself as the ""first society to conduct organised scholarly research into human experiences that challenge contemporary scientific models."" It does not, however, since its inception in 1882, hold any corporate opinions: SPR members assert a variety of beliefs with regard to the nature of the phenomena studied. The Society for Psychical Research (SPR) originated from a discussion between journalist Edmund Rogers and the physicist William F. Barrett in autumn 1881. This led to a conference on 5 and 6 January 1882 at the headquarters of the British National Association of Spiritualists, at which the foundation of the Society was proposed. The committee included Barrett, Rogers, Stainton Moses, Charles Massey, Edmund Gurney, Hensleigh Wedgwood and Frederic W. H. Myers. The SPR was formally constituted on 20 February 1882 with philosopher Henry Sidgwick as its first president. The SPR was the first organisation of its kind in the world, its stated purpose being ""to approach these varied problems without prejudice or prepossession of any kind, and in the same spirit of exact and unimpassioned enquiry which has enabled science to solve so many problems, once not less obscure nor less hotly debated."" Other early members included the author Jane Barlow, the renowned chemist Sir William Crookes, physicist Sir Oliver Lodge, Nobel laureate Charles Richet, artist Lewis Charles Powles and psychologist William James. Members of the SPR initiated and organised the International Congresses of PhysiologicalExperimental psychology. Areas of study included hypnotism, dissociation, thought-transference, mediumship, Reichenbach phenomena, apparitions and haunted houses and the physical phenomena associated with séances. The SPR were to introduce a number of neologisms which have entered the English language, such as 'telepathy', which was coined by Frederic Myers. The Society is run by a President and a Council of twenty members, and is open to interested members of the public to join. The organisation is based at 1 Vernon Mews, London, with a library and office open to members, and with large book and archival holdings in Cambridge University Library, Cambridgeshire, England. It publishes the peer reviewed quarterly Journal of the Society for Psychical Research (JSPR), the irregular Proceedings and the magazine Paranormal Review. It holds an annual conference, regular lectures and two study days per year and supports the LEXSCIEN on-line library project. Among the first important works was the two-volume publication in 1886, Phantasms of the Living, concerning telepathy and apparitions, co-authored by Gurney, Myers and Frank Podmore. This text, and subsequent research in this area, was received negatively by the scientific mainstream, though Gurney and Podmore provided a defense of the society's early work in this area in mainstream publications. The SPR ""devised methodological innovations such as randomized study designs"" and conducted ""the first experiments investigating the psychology of eyewitness testimony (Hodgson and Davey, 1887),  empirical and conceptual studies illuminating mechanisms of dissociation and hypnotism"" In 1894, the Census of Hallucinations was published which sampled 17,000 people. Out of these, 1,684 persons reported having experienced a hallucination of an apparition. Such efforts were claimed to have undermined ""the notion of dissociation and hallucinations as intrinsically pathological phenomena"". The SPR investigated many spiritualist mediums such as Eva Carrière and Eusapia Palladino. During the early twentieth century, the SPR studied a series of automatic scripts and trance utterances from a group of automatic writers, known as the cross-correspondences. Famous cases investigated by the Society include Borley Rectory and the Enfield Poltergeist. In 1912 the Society extended a request for a contribution to a special medical edition of its Proceedings to Sigmund Freud. Though according to Ronald W. Clark (1980) ""Freud surmised, no doubt correctly, that the existence of any link between the founding fathers of psychoanalysis and investigation of the paranormal would hamper acceptance of psychoanalysis"" as would any perceived involvement with the occult. Nonetheless, Freud did respond, contributing an essay titled ""A Note on the Unconscious in Psycho-Analysis"" to the Medical Supplement to the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research. Much of the early work involved investigating, exposing and in some cases duplicating fake phenomena. In the late 19th century, SPR investigations into séance phenomena led to the exposure of many fraudulent mediums. Richard Hodgson distinguished himself in that area. In 1884, Hodgson was sent by the SPR to India to investigate Helena Blavatsky and concluded that her claims of psychic power were fraudulent. However, in 1985 the original finding of fraud was questioned and reinvestigated by the SPR researcher Vernon Harrison, president of the Royal Photographic Society and an expert at detecting forgery. Harrison determined that ""As an investigator, Hodgson is weighed in the balances and found wanting. His case against Madame H. P. Blavatsky is not proven."" In 1886 and 1887 a series of publications by S. J. Davey, Hodgson and Sidgwick in the SPR journal exposed the slate writing tricks of the medium William Eglinton. Hodgson with his friend, S. J. Davey, had staged fake séances for educating the public (including SPR members). Davey gave sittings under an assumed name, duplicating the phenomena produced by Eglinton, and then proceeded to point out to the sitters the manner in which they had been deceived. Because of this, some spiritualist members such as Stainton Moses resigned from the SPR. In 1891, Alfred Russel Wallace requested for the Society to properly investigate spirit photography. Eleanor Sidgwick responded with a critical paper in the SPR which cast doubt on the subject and discussed the fraudulent methods that spirit photographers such as Édouard Isidore Buguet, Frederic Hudson and William H. Mumler had utilised. Due to the exposure of William Hope and other fraudulent mediums, Arthur Conan Doyle led a mass resignation of eighty-four members of the Society for Psychical Research, as they believed the Society was opposed to spiritualism. Science historian William Hodson Brock has noted that ""By the 1900s most avowed spiritualists had left the SPR and gone back to the BNAS (the London Spiritualist Alliance since 1884), having become upset by the sceptical tone of most of the SPR's investigations."" The Society has been criticized by both spiritualists and skeptics. Prominent spiritualists at first welcomed the SPR and cooperated fully, but relations soured when spiritualists discovered that the SPR would not accept outside testimony as proof, and the society accused some prominent mediums of fraud. Spiritualist Arthur Conan Doyle resigned from the SPR in 1930, to protest what he regarded as the SPR's overly restrictive standards of proof. Psychic investigator and believer in spiritualism Nandor Fodor criticised the SPR for its ""strong bias"" against physical manifestations of spiritualism. Skeptics have criticised members of the SPR for having motives liable to impair scientific objectivity. According to SPR critics John Grant and Eric Dingwall (a member of the SPR), early SPR members such as Henry Sidgwick, Frederic W. H. Myers, and William Barrett hoped to cling to something spiritual through psychical research. Myers stated that ""he Society for Psychical Research was founded, with the establishment of thought-transference—already rising within measurable distance of proof—as its primary aim."" Defenders of the SPR have stated in reply that ""a 'will to believe' in post-mortem survival, telepathy and other scientifically unpopular notions, does not necessarily exclude a ""will to know"" and thus the capacity for thorough self-criticism, methodological rigour and relentless suspicion of errors."" The skeptic and physicist Victor J. Stenger has written: The SPR ... on occasion exposed blatant cases of fraud even their own credulous memberships could not swallow. But their journals have never succeeded in achieving a high level of credibility in the eyes of the rest of the scientific community. ... most articles usually begin with the assumption that psychic phenomena are demonstrated realities. Ivor Lloyd Tuckett an author of an early skeptical work on psychical research wrote that although the SPR have collected some valuable work, most of its active members have ""no training in psychology fitting them for their task, and have been the victims of pronounced bias, as sometimes they themselves have admitted."" Trevor H. Hall, an ex-member of the Society for Psychical Research, criticised SPR members for their ""credulous and obsessive wish... to believe."" Hall also claimed SPR members ""lack knowledge of deceptive methods."" Writer Edward Clodd asserted that the SPR members William F. Barrett and Oliver Lodge had insufficient competence for the detection of fraud and suggested that their spiritualist beliefs were based on magical thinking and primitive superstition. Clodd described the SPR as offering ""barbaric spiritual philosophy"", and characterised the language of SPR members as using such terms as ""subliminal consciousness"" and ""telepathic energy,"" as a disguise for ""bastard supernaturalism."" A 2004 psychological study involving 174 members of the Society for Psychical Research completed a delusional ideation questionnaire and a deductive reasoning task. The study found that ""individuals who reported a strong belief in the paranormal made more errors and displayed more delusional ideation than skeptical individuals"". The study also claims that reasoning abnormalities may have a causal role in the formation of paranormal belief. However, the study was set up to detect the effect of bias on reasoning, rather than the underlying capacity (or inablity) of believers to perform critical assessments. Therefore the study suggests a relationship between bias and reasoning, rather than a direct relationship between paranormal belief and reasoning. Some skeptical members have resigned from the SPR. Eric Dingwall resigned and wrote "" After sixty years' experience and personal acquaintance with most of the leading parapsychologists of that period I do not think I could name half a dozen whom I could call objective students who honestly wished to discover the truth. The great majority wanted to prove something or other: They wanted the phenomena into which they were inquiring to serve some purpose in supporting preconceived theories of their own.""(1985) The following is a list of presidents: The Society publishes Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research, and the Paranormal Review, as well as the online Psi Encyclopedia. First published in 1882 as a public record of the activities of the SPR, the Proceedings are now reserved for longer pieces of work, such as Presidential Addresses, and are only occasionally published. The current editor is Dr David Vernon. The Journal of the Society for Psychical Research has been published quarterly since 1884. It was introduced as a private, members-only periodical to supplement the Proceedings. It now focuses on current laboratory and field research, but also includes theoretical, methodological and historical papers on parapsychology. It also publishes book reviews and correspondence. The current editor is Dr David Vernon. The Magazine of the Society for Psychical Research, formerly known as the Psi Researcher and Paranormal Review, has been published since 1996. Previous editors have included Dr Nicola J. Holt. The current editor is Dr Leo Ruickbie. The Psi Encyclopedia is a collection of articles and case studies about psi research, involving the scientific investigation of psychic phenomena. A bequest of Nigel Buckmaster enabled the foundation of the encyclopedia. A number of other psychical research organisations use the term 'Society for Psychical Research' in their name.

"Parkland is a 2013 American historical drama film that recounts the chaotic events that occurred following the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy. The film was written and directed by Peter Landesman, and produced by Playtone's Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman, Bill Paxton, and Exclusive Media's Nigel Sinclair and Matt Jackson. The film is based on Vincent Bugliosi's 2008 book Four Days in November: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Parkland weaves together the perspectives of a handful of ordinary individuals suddenly thrust into extraordinary circumstances: the young doctors and nurses at Parkland Hospital; Dallas's chief of the Secret Service; a bystander who captured what became the most famous home movie in history; the FBI agents who were visited by Lee Harvey Oswald before the shooting; the brother of Oswald, left to deal with his shattered family; and JFK's security team, witnesses to both the president's death and Vice President Lyndon Johnson's succession to office. Production began in January 2013 in Austin, Texas. Writerdirector Peter Landesman has stated that the film does not explore the various conspiracy theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination. The major hospital scenes were filmed in a building housed on the campus of Austin State Hospital in Austin, due to the period look and feel of the building. Parkland premiered at the 70th Venice International Film Festival, and was also screened at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. Coinciding with the assassination's 50th anniversary year, the film was released theatrically in the United States on October 4, 2013. Parkland received mixed reviews, holding a 50% rating, based on 123 reviews, on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes; the consensus states: ""Although its decision to look at John F. Kennedy's assassination through uncommon perspectives is refreshing, Parkland never achieves the narrative cohesion its subject deserves."" On Metacritic, the film has a 51100 rating, signifying ""mixed or average reviews"". The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 5, 2013. Historian Peter Ling awarded Parkland four out of five stars for enjoyment and three stars for historical accuracy. Reviewing the film, he praised its attempt to ""capture the desperate efforts made to save Kennedy in the operating room."" He told historyextra, ""It shows that the head nurse, Doris Nelson (played by Marcia Gay Harden), had to take a piece of JFK's skull and some brain tissue from Mrs Kennedy , and that junior doctor, Jim Carrico (played by Zac Efron), had to be told to stop the frenetic but fruitless cardiac massage at one o'clock, when the team declared JFK dead."" However, he claimed there may have been ""suspect influences"" on Abraham Zapruder's decision to hand over his film to Life magazine. He said, ""Once copies have been given to the Secret Service and the FBI, Zapruder has to choose from many media outlets who want to buy the film. He chooses Life because he says he respects the publication, but the movie seems to hint that any suppression of the film's contents is in line with Zapruder's wishes, and not because of suspect influences at Life itself, whose managing director  had CIA connections.""",Normal

"U.S. Highway 83 U.S. Route83 (US83) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that travels from the Mexico–United States border in Brownsville, Texas, to the Canada–United States border near Westhope, North Dakota. In the state of North Dakota, US83 extends from the South Dakota border north to the Canada-United States border. US83 enters North Dakota at the South Dakota state line, near the town of Hague, and runs northward for approximately 68 miles (109km), serving the small cities of Strasburg and Linton before reaching Interstate 94 (I-94). It follows I-94 west to Bismarck, where it resumes a generally northward course as a four-lane highway. Headed toward Minot US83 traverses mostly agricultural land, passing through some small cities such as Wilton, Washburn and Underwood north to Max. Leaving Underwood, US83 encounters a large strip-mining coal (lignite) operation which can not only be seen from the roadway in the vicinity of Falkirk, but a small viaduct carries coal over the highway. North of Coleharbor, US83 briefly merges both roadways and shares land with an adjacent railroad line in order to cross a viaduct that separates Lake Sakakawea from Lake Audubon. North of the lakes, the surroundings return to cropland and grazing land, though a wind farm is located south of Minot. US83 passes directly through Minot, where it is known as Broadway, although the Minot Bypass to the west is an alternate route. The northbound route passes the airport and continues to Minot Air Force Base, where it returns to a two-lane highway, and shares a roadway with eastbound North Dakota Highway 5 (ND5) about thirty miles (50km) north of the base for about ten miles (16km). The highway then diverges from ND5 to head north to the border with Canada at the 49th parallel, and enters southwestern Manitoba as Provincial Trunk Highway 83.",Normal

"FileMaker is a cross-platform relational database application developed by Claris International, a subsidiary of Apple Inc. It integrates a database engine with a graphical user interface (GUI) and security features, allowing users to visually modify a database. Versions for desktops, servers, iOS and web-delivery have been released. The desktop app is based on a DOS application originally named FileMaker, which was then developed primarily for the Apple Macintosh and released in April 1985. It was rebranded as FileMaker Pro in 1990. Since 1992 it has been available for Microsoft Windows and for the classic Mac OS and macOS, and has cross-platform capabilities. FileMaker Go, the mobile app, was released for iOS devices in July 2010. FileMaker Server allows centralized hosting of apps which can be used by clients running both the desktop and mobile apps. A cloud variant, named FileMaker Cloud, is hosted by Claris. FileMaker began as an MS-DOS-based computer program named Nutshell, developed by Nashoba Systems of Concord, Massachusetts in the early 1980s. Nutshell was distributed by Leading Edge, an electronics marketing company that had recently started selling IBM PC-compatible computers. With the introduction of the Macintosh, Nashoba combined the basic data engine with a new forms-based graphical user interface (GUI). Leading Edge was not interested in newer versions, preferring to remain a DOS-only vendor, and kept the Nutshell name. Nashoba found another distributor, Forethought Inc., and introduced the program on the Macintosh platform as FileMaker in April 1985. When Apple introduced the Macintosh Plus in 1986, the next version of FileMaker was named FileMaker Plus to reflect the new model's name. Forethought was purchased by Microsoft, which was then introducing their PowerPoint product that became part of Microsoft Office. Microsoft had introduced its own database application, Microsoft File, shortly before FileMaker, but was outsold by FileMaker, leading to Microsoft File's discontinuation. Microsoft negotiated with Nashoba for the right to publish FileMaker, but Nashoba decided to self-publish the next version, FileMaker 4. Shortly after FileMaker 4's release, Apple Computer Company formed Claris, a wholly owned subsidiary, to market software. Claris purchased Nashoba to round out its software suite. By that point, Leading Edge and Nutshell had faded from the marketplace because of competition from other DOS- and later Windows-based database products. FileMaker, however, continued to succeed on the Macintosh platform. Claris changed the product's name to FileMaker II to conform to its naming scheme for other products, such as MacWrite II, but the product changed little from the last Nashoba version, with several minor versions following. In 1990, the product was released as FileMaker Pro 1.0, and in September 1992, Claris released a cross-platform version for both the Mac and Windows. Except for a few platform-specific functions, the program's features and user interface remained the same. Up to this point, FileMaker had no real relational capabilities; it was limited to automatically looking up and importing values from other files. It only had the ability to save a state—a filter, a sort, and a layout for the data. Version 3.0, released around 1995, introduced new relational and scripting features. By 1995, FileMaker Pro was the only well-performing product in Claris's lineup. In 1998, Apple moved development of some of the other Claris products in-house, dropped most of the rest, and changed Claris's name to FileMaker Inc., followed by a concentrated development of FileMaker alone. In 2020, FileMaker International Inc. changed its name (back) to Claris International Inc. and announced the Claris Connect workflow software. Version 4.0, introduced in 1997, added a plug-in architecture much like that of Adobe Photoshop, which enabled third-party developers to add features to FileMaker. A bundled plug-in, the Web Companion, allowed the database to act as a web server. Other plug-ins added features to the interface and enabled FileMaker to serve as an FTP client, perform external file operations, and send messages to remote FileMaker files over the Internet or an intranet. Version 5 introduced a new file format, which came with the file extension .fp5. Version 7, released in 2004, introduced a new file format with the extension .fp7, supporting file sizes up to 8 terabytes (an increase from the 2 gigabytes allowed in previous versions). Individual fields could hold up to 4 gigabytes of binary data (container fields) or 2 gigabytes of 2-byte Unicode text per record (up from 64 kilobytes in previous versions). FileMaker's relational model was also expanded, offering multiple tables per file and a graphical relationship editor that displayed and allowed manipulation of related tables in a manner that resembled the entity-relationship diagram format. Accompanying these important changes, FileMaker Inc. also introduced a developer certification program. In 2005 FileMaker Inc. announced the FileMaker 8 product family, which offered developers an expanded feature set. These included a tabbed interface, script variables, tooltips, enhanced debugging, custom menus, and the ability to copy and paste entire tables and field definitions, scripts, and script steps within and between files. Version 8.5, released in 2006, added an integrated web viewer (with the ability to view such things as shipment tracking information from FedEx and Wikipedia entries) and named layout objects. FileMaker 9, released on July 10, 2007, introduced a quick-start screen, conditional formatting, fluid layout auto-resizing, hyperlinked pointers into databases, and external SQL links. FileMaker 10 was released on January 5, 2009, before that year's Macworld Conference & Expo, and offered scripts that can be triggered by user actions and a redesigned user interface similar to that of Mac OS X Leopard (10.5) applications. FileMaker 11, released on March 9, 2010, introduced charting, which was further streamlined in FileMaker 12, released April 4, 2012. That version also added themes, more database templates (so-called 'starter solutions') and simplified creation of iOS databases. FileMaker Go 11 (July 20, 2010) and FileMaker Go 12 for iPhone and iPad (April 4, 2012) allowed only the creation, modification, and deletion of records on these handheld devices, whereas design and schema changes had to be made within the full FileMaker Pro application. FileMaker Go 12 brought with it multitasking, improved media integration, export of data to multiple formats and enhanced container fields. FileMaker 13, released after the launches of iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks (10.9), first shipped in December 2013. The client and server products were enhanced to support more mobile and web methods of data access. FileMaker Go 13, the parallel iPad–iPhone product, became a single client for both devices, and the Server Admin tool now ran in HTML5, no longer requiring a Java app. The FileMaker 14 platform released on May 15, 2015. It included FileMaker Pro 14, FileMaker Pro 14 Advanced, FileMaker Server 14 and FileMaker Go 14. This was followed by version 15 in May 2016 and version 16 in May 2017; both including equivalent Pro, Pro Advanced, Server and Go versions. In late 2016, FileMaker began annually publicizing a software roadmap of incoming features already being worked on, as well as identifying features they are moving away from or may deprecate in the near future. FileMaker Inc. had always had a hard time describing what FileMaker software was, because it covered a plethora of ground unrelated to databases; user interface, security, rapid application development tools, etc. At their annual developers conference in August 2018, FileMaker Inc. initiated a new marketing program called ""Workplace Innovation Platform"" to address the problem of its self-described software category. On September 27, 2016, FileMaker Cloud was introduced, including a Linux server (CentOS), which was offered exclusively through the Amazon Marketplace. In November 2019, FileMaker Cloud was reintroduced as a software as a service product offered directly from Claris for FileMaker Pro 18.0.3, using the FileMaker Server Cloud 2.18 service on Amazon servers. Despite this, it was managed by Claris instead of through the Amazon Marketplace, and made use of the new FileMaker ID authentication. In October 2020, Claris released a Linux version of FileMaker Server, first on CentOS (19.1) then on Ubuntu (19.2). * (*) indicates both FileMaker ProFileMaker Pro Advanced (Developer Edition in v4-6) or FileMaker ServerFileMaker Server Advanced FileMaker files are compatible between Mac and Windows. File type extensions are: Self-running applications (runtime, kiosk mode) are platform-specific only. FileMaker is available in worldwide English, Simplified Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. There are also specific versions of FileMaker for users of Central European, Indian and Middle Eastern languages. These versions offer spellchecking, data entry, sorting and printing options for languages of the respective region. They also contain localized templates and localized instant web publishing. The Central European version FileMaker includes English, Russian, Polish, Czech and Turkish interfaces. There are customized templates for Russian, Polish, Czech, Turkish. In addition Russian, Greek, Estonian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Serbian, Bulgarian and Hungarian are supported to varying degrees. The version intended for Southeast Asian languages has only an English user interface, but supports Indic-language data entry, sorting and indexing in Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, Panjabi, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. Similarly, the Middle Eastern version has only English and French user interfaces, but with its option to change the text direction to right-to-left, it does support Arabic and Hebrew data entry. FileMaker Pro and FileMaker Pro Advanced include scripting capabilities and many built-in functions for automation of common tasks and complex calculations. Numerous steps are available for navigation, conditional execution of script steps, editing records, and other utilities. FileMaker Pro Advanced provides a script debugger which allows the developer to set break points, monitor data values and step through script lines. FileMaker 13 introduced a script that more deeply queries container field document metadata. The FileMaker Dynamic Markup Language or FDML was a markup language used in the earlier versions of FileMaker introduced in 1998. FDML is also often referred to as Claris Dynamic Markup Language or CDML, named after its former company Claris. FDML was an extension of HTML that used special tags, such as  to display FileMaker data on Web pages. FileMaker officially dropped support for FDML in 2004. Since version 9, FileMaker has had the ability to connect to a number of SQL databases without resorting to using SQL, including MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. This requires installation of the SQL database ODBC driver (in many cases a third-party license per client driver) to connect to a SQL database. Through Extended SQL Services (ESS), SQL databases can be used as data sources in FileMaker's relationship graph, thus allowing the developer to create new layouts based on the SQL database; create, edit, and delete SQL records via FileMaker layouts and functions; and reference SQL fields in FileMaker calculations and script steps. It is a cross-platform relational database application. Versions from FileMaker Pro 5.5 onwards also have an ODBC interface. FileMaker 12 introduced a new function, ExecuteSQL, which allows the user to perform an SQL query against the FileMaker database to retrieve data, but does not allow data modification or deletion, or schema changes. FileMaker allows non-numeric characters to be stored in its ""numeric"" field type unless the field is specifically marked as strictly ""numeric"". Through a third party, Actual Technologies, FileMaker 15 and forward, also, support ODBC connectivity to IBM I 7.3 (AS400), IBM Db2 11.1, and PostgreSQL 9.6.12. Using the Actual Adapter, these ODBC connections can also make ESS connections and be used as sources in the Relationship Graph. FileMaker 16 provides integrations via cURL, JSON, REST-based FileMaker Data API support. Tableau Web Data Connector is offered to visualize FileMaker data. The REST-based API license is a free trial that expired September 27, 2018. FileMaker 17 offers a permanent REST-based Data API. Standard licensing include 2GB of outbound data per user per month. Container data does not count towards this limit, and inbound Data API data transfer is unlimited. FileMaker 19 for Linux and FileMaker Cloud provide a OData gateway, allowing JSON and XML output (Atom).",Normal

"Amos 3 is the third chapter of the Book of Amos in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet Amos, especially God's extraordinary love, being repaid by Israel with ingratitude, of necessity calls for judgments. In the Hebrew Bible it is a part of the Book of the Twelve Minor Prophets. In this chapter, following oracles against Israel and Judah and the countries surrounding them in chapters 1 and 2, Amos addresses ""Judah and Israel together - the whole family (Amos 3:1) whom  had brought up from Egypt"". Jennifer Dines treats Amos 3:1-5:17 as a single literary unit, whereas John Nelson Darby treats each chapter, except for chapters 1 and 2, as ""a distinct prophecy"". The original text was written in Hebrew. This chapter is divided into 15 verses. Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments cumulatively containing all verses of this chapter in Hebrew were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls including 4Q78 (4QXIIc; 75–50 BCE) with extant verses 1–15; and 4Q82 (4QXIIg; 25 BCE) with extant verses 1–2. There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; G {displaystyle {mathfrak {G}}} B; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; G {displaystyle {mathfrak {G}}} A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; G {displaystyle {mathfrak {G}}} Q; 6th century). The New International Version translates this verse as ""Do two walk together unless they have agreed to do so?"" Darby relates this comment to Israel and God, and by extension to the individual, ""our walk"", with God. Alexander Maclaren notes that two friends can journey together without having to agree on everything. ""They must, however, wish to keep each other's company, and they must be going by the same road to the same place."" This verse is treated as Amos' first reference to the idea of a ""remnant"", to which he refers again in Amos 5:15 and more completely in Amos 9:8:",Normal

"Yarim-Lim I, also given as Yarimlim, (reigned c. 1780 BC– c. 1764 BC) was the second king of the ancient Amorite kingdom of Yamhad in modern-day Aleppo, Syria. Yarim-Lim was the son and successor of the first king Sumu-Epuh and his queen Sumunna-Abi. His wife was Gashera, of unknown parents. She outlived her husband and became a strong-willed widow who was part of politics during the reign of Hammurabi. Their daughter Shibtu married Zimri-Lim of Mari. The kingdom of Yamhad was being threatened by the Assyrian king Shamshi-AdadI who had surrounded Yamhad through his alliance with Carchemish and Urshu to the north, Qatna to the south, and conquering Mari to the east, appointing his son Yasmah-Adad on its throne. Yarim-Lim ascended the throne after his father was killed in 1780 BC during his campaigns against Shamshi-Adad. He was able to stand up to Shamshi-Adad by surrounding him with deft alliances with Hammurabi of Babylon and Ibal-pi-elII of Eshnunna. His alliance with Hammurabi was credited with saving Babylon from an Assyrian attack by attacking their rear. In 1777 BC, Yarim-Lim conquered the city of Tuttul, on the confluence of the rivers Balikh and Euphrates. He appointed his ally, Zimri-Lim, the heir to the throne of Mari who was living in exile at his court, as king. When Shamshi-Adad died in 1776 BC, he helped Zimrilim regain his throne in Mari and oust Yasmah-Adad. The alliance between Mari and Yamhad was cemented with the royal marriage between Zimrilim and Yarim-Lim's daughter Shibtu. Two days after the marriage ceremony queen Sumunna-Abi died. Ibal-pi-el II of Eshnuna exploited the death of Shamshi-Adad to pursuit an expansionist policy, advancing on the account of Assyria and causing stress to the alliance. He later allied himself with Elam, the enemy of Hammurabi who was Yarim-Lim's ally. Zimri-Lim's ascension to the throne with the help of Yarim-Lim I affected the status of Mari, Zimri-Lim referred to Yarim-Lim as his father and acted under the guidance of the Yamhadite main deity Hadad, of which Yarim-Lim was the mediator. The tablets of Mari recorded many events that revealed Zimri-Lim's subordination. On two occasions Zimri-Lim demanded the extradition of his subordinates from Yarim-Lim I. The first case was related to a vassal king of Zimri-Lim who addressed him as a brother instead of a father and the demand was refused, while the second was through the Mariote ambassador in Aleppo Daris-Libur in which Zimri-Lim asked for some fugitives to which Yarim-Lim answered with decline twice before agreeing on the Mariote ambassador's third attempt. At one instance Nur-Sin the Mariote ambassador in Aleppo wrote to his master for the handing of an estate called Alahtum to Hadad (meaning Aleppo), and in another instance, Ibal-pi-el offered peace and fixing the borders to Zimri-Lim who sent envoys to Yarim-Lim asking for authorization which was not given, leading Zimri-Lim to refuse the treaty on three occasions. There is no king who is mighty by himself. Ten or fifteen kings follow Hammurabi the ruler of Babylon, a like number of Rim-Sin of Larsa, a like number of Ibal-pi-el of Eshnunna, a like number of Amud-pi-el of Qatanum, but twenty follow Yarim-Lim of Yamhad. —An excerpt from a tablet from the archives at Mari Yarim-Lim extended his influence to several other important city-states in Syria through alliance and vassalage, including Urshu and the rich kingdom of Ugarit. The relationship between Qatna and Yamhad seems to have improved during Yarim-Lim's reign as well. The armies of Aleppo campaigned as far as Elam near the modern southern Iraqi-Iranian borders: a tablet discovered at Mari revealed the extent of those military interventions in Mesopotamia; the tablet includes a declaration of war against Dēr and Diniktum in retaliation for their evil deeds, a reminder to the king of Dēr about the military help given to him for fifteen years by Yarim-Lim and the stationing of 500 Aleppan warships for twelve years in Diniktum. By the time of his death, Yarim-Lim, had more than twenty kings as vassals and allies. According to Historian William J. Hamblin he was at the time the ""mightiest ruler in the Near East outside of Egypt,"" He died c. 1764 BC and was succeeded by his son Hammurabi I.",Normal
"The Stelton Baptist Church is in the Stelton section of Edison, Middlesex County, New Jersey. It is the second oldest Baptist Church in New Jersey and the tenth oldest in the United States. The congregation was formed in the spring of 1689, and among its original members was the Stelle family, after whom the Stelton section of Edison, New Jersey is named. Up until 1875 the church was known as the First Baptist Church of Piscataway. The land occupied by the church and cemetery at Stelton was purchased in April 1731. The first church was erected in 1748, and that building was taken down and rebuilt in 1825. This building was destroyed by a fire on New Year's Day, January 1, 1851. In 1870 portions of Piscataway, New Jersey and Woodbridge, New Jersey were used to form Raritan, New Jersey. The site of the church later became Edison, New Jersey. The building which took its place was destroyed in a fire in 1924. The present building was erected in 1925. The cemetery contains hundreds of early burials, including Andrew Drake. The first female pastor of the congregation, the Rev. Kathleen Tice, was installed in 1999. After 10 years of service at the congregation, Pastor Tice retired during the summer of 2010. 40°31′01″N 74°24′25″W﻿ ﻿40.517047°N 74.406964°W﻿ 40.517047; -74.406964",Normal

"Mary Ann Girling (1827–1886) was an English religious leader, the founder of the sect called ""The People of God"", also known as New Forest Shakers. Girling was the daughter of William Clouting (or Clowting), a small farmer, born in the parish of Little Glemham, Suffolk, on 27 April 1827. She had little formal education, and her letters were full of spelling and grammatical errors, but she was considered to be quite intelligent. When she was 16, she married George Stanton Girling in the Anglican Church. He was first a seaman, then a fitter in an iron foundry, and afterwards a general dealer at Ipswich. She had eight miscarriages and two surviving children. Girling had a vision of Jesus Christ on Christmas Day 1858; by Christmas 1864, she began to believe that she was a new incarnation of the Deity. One sign of this was in the stigmata which appeared on her hands, feet, and side. She was wont to describe with minute details the extraordinary emotion which overwhelmed her at the moment when she experienced the divine call. From that period she went about proclaiming the new revelation and speaking as with absolute knowledge of hidden mysteries. She gathered around her a small company of men and women, belonging for the most part to the labouring classes. Their first meeting-place for public worship was at 107 Bridge Road, Battersea, London, where in August 1870 they attracted much attention. They were generally called shakers, but they themselves never accepted that name, but always spoke of their community as the Children of God. By 1871, Girling had been barred from preaching in the Methodist chapels which she had previously attended. This was likely due in part to her style of preaching—an eyewitness who called her ""the high priestess of Jumperism"" wrote ""the woman prayed volubly, and used her long arms freely in gesticulation…actually screaming in a which I thought might have caused a jump or two."" However, it also reflected unease with her increasingly public claims to divinity. On 2 January 1872, the Children of God removed from London and settled near Hordle in the New Forest, Hampshire, where Miss Julia Wood, a wealthy lady, had purchased for them a residence and a farm, known as New Forest Lodge. Wood gave £2,250 for the property, on which there remained a mortgage of £1,000. Here the community increased to 160 persons, who learnt to regard Mrs. Girling, ‘their mother,’ with tenderness, love, and reverence. She owed her authority over her people to her belief in herself and to her great force of will. Their faith in her endured through cold, hunger, and suffering, and many and repeated misfortunes. It was believed that they would all live for ever, and that sooner or later everybody would acknowledge the divinity of Mrs. Girling, who would then rule over a peaceful world. She was a tall, lean woman, with an upright carriage, a strong, intelligent countenance, bright eyes, a very good expression, and a rather winning voice. She had scruples against going to law, which afterwards made her an easy prey to her enemies. The community was industrious, and lived in a state of celibacy. It also followed Girling's prohibitions on trade, leading it to fall into debt and be evicted from New Forest Lodge on 15 December 1874. Girling was subsequently declared insane, though the verdict was overturned; several years later, Miss Wood was also declared insane and spent 24 years in an asylum. The eviction took place in very severe weather, and the pitiable condition of the people excited much commiseration, particularly following reports that an infant had died of exposure. The community camped on the roadside for two days, when they had notice to leave, and part of the community returned to their homes in various parts of the country. A Mr. Beasley then offered them the use of a shed, where they remained for three weeks, but the place was not large enough for them all to sit down at one time. They next found a friend in the Hon. Auberon E. M. Herbert, who gave them the use of a barn on the Ashley Arnewood farm, Lymington, on the condition that Girling sign an agreement to ""prevent any dances without clothes taking place among any of the brothers, sisters or children"", reflecting the widespread belief that the Children of God engaged in orgies, witchcraft, and other unsavory practices. After staying in Herbert's barn for five weeks, they removed to a field which they formerly had on lease with New Forest Lodge; when this lease expired they were again turned into the roadway, and there they lived night and day for five weeks. In 1879, Girling rented a two-acre farm called Tiptoe Farm, near Hordle. Here the community erected a number of wooden huts with canvas roofs, with a larger and superior hut as a place of public worship. The farm became a tourist attraction, with visitors arriving in charabancs on the weekends and buying quantities of beer from the nearby public house. Girling publicly announced her divinity in a letter to local newspapers in February 1882. The only publication known to survive, however, is a four-page tract entitled The Close of the Dispensation: the Last Message to the Church and the World. It is signed ‘Jesus First and Last (Mary Ann Girling), Tiptoe, Hordle, near Lymington, Hants, 1883.’ In it she says: I now close this letter with the true and loving declaration that I am the second appearing of Jesus, the Christ of God, the Bride, the Lamb's Wife, the God-mother and Saviour, life from heaven, and that there will not be another. Latterly the Children of God escaped public notice, except from excursionists visiting the place. The cold and exposure at last told on Mrs. Girling, and she fell ill. During her illness she did not lose faith in what she had preached, and believed that she would never die, but would live until the second coming of Christ. Girling was diagnosed with cancer of the womb and died at Tiptoe, Hordle, on 18 September 1886 (aged 59), and was buried in Hordle churchyard 22 September. A large crowd turned out for the funeral. Afterwards, those of the community who had friends returned to them, and only six persons were left to occupy the camp at Tiptoe. Girling left children, among them a younger son, William Girling. According to author Philip Hoare, Girling inspired Andrew Thomas Turton Peterson's interest in spiritualism and mesmerism. During a séance, Peterson claimed to have received the plans for what would become Peterson's Tower in Sway, Hampshire from Sir Christopher Wren. In the 1870s and 1880s, local newspapers regularly reported ""rescues"" and escape attempts related to the Children of God, claiming that members of the community were terrified of Girling. ""While under Mrs Girling's reign of terror"", one was said to have written, ""I was not allowed to write to you, or do anything only in strict accordance with her decrees."" Girling has also become the subject of urban legends. In Hampshire and Isle of Wight Folk Tales, author Michael O'Leary reports that in the 1990s, a group of young men who had robbed a service station stashed the money in Hordle churchyard. When one of them returned to claim it, he encountered ""the tall, gaunt, angular figure of a woman, wearing a long, black Victorian dress and a large, black bonnet…and she was jumping–up and down–up and down…"" The young man fled, and ""The police found him the next day, crouching in a foetal position, rocking backwards and forwards, laughing and crying at the same time.""",Normal
"Linda Cuthbert (born May 20, 1956) is a Canadian former diver and present sports director of Commonwealth Sport Canada since 2006, having also served as a technical official for several commonwealth games. During her diving career, Cuthbert won a bronze medal in each of the 1975 and 1979 Pan American Games platform diving events, as well as a gold medal in the 1978 Commonwealth Games 10 metre highboard event. Cuthbert began diving at age 10 and started to take it seriously in 1967, when she had a series of different coaches until settling with Don Webb, who became her permanent coach. Her competitive career began in 14, when she moved away from her family to focus on training with her coach and first made the national team in 1971. She finished fourth at the 1974 British Commonwealth Games diving event, just missing out on bronze. During her employment with a bank, she would be permitted time off to train and would receive $600 annual training expenses from the Canadian Olympic Committee. She was one of four Canadian athletes who featured in the National Film Board of Canada 1979 documentary Going the Distance. In 1980, she vocally opposed proposed boycotts of the 1980 Summer Olympics in relation to the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan, instead suggesting that athletes should turn their back on the soviet flag and not attend opening ceremonies in protest. She was involved in a diving accident in May 1980, when upon performing a somersault, lost her balance and hit her head on the springboard, falling unconscious into the pool. Although only suffering with a deep gash to the head and concussion, she missed out on making the Canadian 1980 Summer Olympics team. Just several months later in September 1980, Cuthbert announced her retirement from competitive diving, citing a loss of motivation and the continual problems of finding training facilities. In 2003, Cuthbert established her company Breakthrough Performance and had previously been a managing consultant with the Canadian Olympic Centre. She has served on the board of directors of various Canadian sport and aquatic institutions and as of 2021, she chairs the Sport Committee of Commonwealth Sport Canada. Born on May 20, 1956, Cuthbert began entering diving competitions at the age of 10 when living in Vancouver after the family relocated there from Toronto. In 1967, the family moved to Beaconsfield, Quebec and she then started to become serious about diving and joined the Pointe Claire Diving Club. She had various coaches for a period of time until Don Webb moved there from Toronto and became her permanent, trusted coach. Her career began at the age of 14, when she moved away from her family home to train with her national coach Don Webb in Winnipeg, making her first national team in 1971. When she was 14, she secured fifth in the American National Championships. During the Amateur Athletic Union Indoor Platform Diving Championships in 1973, she finished second with a score of 321.30. She and Cindy Shatto lived with Webb and would move around with him in search of top diving facilities, which necessitated needing to join new schools, make new friends and make life adjustments each time. Although she passed her grade 13 exams, she did not do as well as she liked as she believed the constant changing of schools was disruptive to her education. She also expressed how traveling around would upset her and made her sick more than usually expected, while she also felt lacking in confidence and considered herself as her ""own worst enemy"", suggesting that she didn't have the experience or consistency as other competitors like Beverley Boys. The first time she traveled abroad, to the Soviet Union and Germany, she would be overcome with fear and during a trial practice, belly flopped from the high tower resulting in a temporary loss of sight, breathlessness and bruising, requiring a hospital visit and subsequent bed rest. She participated in the 1974 British Commonwealth Games, narrowly missing out on a bronze medal in the 10-metre tower event, scoring 334.71 compared to Australian Madeleine Barnett, who finished 3rd with 339.30. On missing out on the bronze, she recalled how mad she was at the time and the desire to be better, describing how she ""blew a reverse one and a half. Don't do that dive any more"". That same year, she won second place at the World Junior Championships In 1975, she was employed by a bank, who would provide her with additional help, allowing her time off work to undertake her intensive training. She would receive an annual training expenses grant worth $600 from the Canadian Olympic Committee She won a bronze medal in each of the 1975 and 1979 Pan American Games, as well as a gold medal in the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton. During her dive in the 1975 games, she broke a strap in her swimsuit, which slipped to her waist and was captured by an underwater camera which broadcast the moment on Mexican national television. In 1977, she was a student at George Brown College and in 1979, was one of four Canadian athletes selected by director Paul Cowan to appear in the National Film Board of Canada documentary Going the Distance, about the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton. By that time, she was being coached by Jim Lambie, who would use swearing and insults towards his divers in an attempt to encourage them to produce brilliance. She first made the news in 1980 when voicing opposition in Canada's decision to boycott the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, saying the only people it would hurt would be the athletes. On her opinion whether countries should have taken action against the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan, she suggested that boycotting was not the answer, instead believing that not attending opening ceremonies and athletes turning their back on the Soviet flag when one of their athletes won would be more effective. In May 1980, Cuthbert lost her balance during a somersault and hit her head on the springboard, falling unconscious into the pool. The dive she performed was a reverse 2.5 somersault, one she was familiar and experienced with, yet despite plenty of height, did not manage to get far enough out from the board. On her descent, she hit her head against the 3-metre diving board, falling unconsciously into the water. She was retrieved from the water by judge Frank Groff and coach Don Webb, who jump in fully clothed to retrieve her. Cuthbert was rushed to hospital while still out cold. Doctors feared she may have suffered cracked vertebrae, but tests taken at Toronto General Hospital showed this was not the case, instead just being concussion. Speaking after coming around, Cuthbert said ""I don't remember too much, but it's finally beginning to hit me."" As a result, she missed out on making the Canadian 1980 Summer Olympics team. At the time of the accident, Cuthbert was in second place in the Olympic trials and almost a certainty to secure a place on the Olympic team in both the 3 metre and 10 metre events. She had trained for 10 years to make the Olympic team. She suffered with a deep gash to the head and concussion. After leaving hospital and recovering, she climbed back onto the diving board in June 1980, although was not in a rush to perform the same dive that put her in hospital on 17 May. In September 1980, Cuthbert announced her retirement from competitive diving, citing a loss of motivation to train and the continual problems of finding training facilities. Despite her decision to retire coming just several months after her accident, she expressed the two were unrelated and made her decision while on a tour of China, Hong-Kong and Japan. In 2002, Cuthbert was known to be president of the Canadian Amateur Diving Association. The following year in 2003, she established her company Breakthrough Performance. Prior to that, she was a managing consultant with the Canadian Olympic Centre and had previously held various roles including in marketing and broadcasting. Between 2003 and 2007, Cuthbert was the president of the Aquatic Federation of Canada and expressed her devastation in January 2005 at the decision to remove the 2005 world aquatic championships from Montreal due to financial concerns. Cuthbert feared it could set sport in Canada back by several years and questioned the country's commitment to sport, noting that federations looking to host events in the subsequent decade may not have confidence that Canada would be capable of hosting. From 2006, Cuthbert sat on the Board of Directors at the Commonwealth Sport Canada, serving as its vice president and chairs the External Representation Committee, which has a responsibility towards strategy and guideline development for effectively representing the organization to outside entities. She was also a technical official for several commonwealth games events, including the 2006 Commonwealth Games at Melbourne and 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester. Having dedicated most of her life to sport, she felt a duty to give back, particularly as the Commonwealth Games played a significant part during her diving career and the satisfaction in seeing young athletes achieve success. As of 2021, she chairs the Sport Committee of Commonwealth Sport Canada. When not diving, Cuthbert worked as a dental hygienist. At the age of 18, Cuthbert measured 5feet 2inches (1.57m) tall and weighed 104 pounds (47kg) and was described as being as ""pretty as a picture"". As of 2021, Cuthbert lived in Toronto, Canada.",Normal

"Vanessa Chinitor (born 13 October 1976, Dendermonde, East Flanders) is a Belgian singer, best known outside Belgium for her participation in the 1999 Eurovision Song Contest. In 1996, Chinitor was a finalist in the VTM talent show Ontdek de Ster Show (The Discover the Star Show). She released her first single, ""In al mijn dromen"", in 1998. In 1999, Chinitor's song ""Like the Wind"" was chosen as the Belgian representative in the 44th Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 29 May in Jerusalem. Chinitor was unfortunate to be drawn to sing second, the draw known to Eurovision fans as the 'no hoper' as no song performed second has ever won the contest. ""Like the Wind"" is a distinctive song with new-age influences, which could not match Belgium's relatively high placement in the 1998 contest but managed to finish in a respectable joint 12th place of 23 entries, having received 38 points, the same as the United Kingdom entry. In 2006, Chinitor participated for a second time in the Belgian Eurovision selection, but her song ""Beyond You"" did not progress beyond the quarter-final stage. Chinitor released her first album, also titled Like the Wind, in 1999. This album was recorded entirely in English and included the single ""When the Siren Calls"", which was a moderate hit. Chinitor returned to recording in Dutch for the single ""Verlangen"", which reached the top 10 of the Ultratop Flemish chart. She also recorded a version of the song ""Ik neem vandaag de trein"", originally recorded by another Belgian Eurovision representative, Ann Christy.

"The Kalahari Meerkat Project, or KMP, is a long term research project focused on studying the evolutionary causes and ecological consequences of cooperative behaviors in meerkats. The secondary aims of the project are to determine what factors affect the reproductive success of the meerkats and what behavioral and physiological mechanisms control both reproduction and cooperative behavior. The project is also working on monitoring overall plant and animal populations within the reserve and work with the nearby community of Van Zylsrus in the areas of conservation and sustainable use of resources. Situated at the Kuruman River Reserve in Northern Cape, South Africa, close to the border to Botswana, the project is jointly funded by Cambridge University and the Kalahari Research Trust. The project was founded in the early nineties by researchers (Prof. Tim Clutton-Brock) at Cambridge University. It was originally based on the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, but in 1993 moved to the Kuruman River Reserve, an area spanning approximately twenty square miles of semi-arid area of the Kalahari Desert on either side of the mostly dry Kuruman River. The reserve consists primarily of sparsely vegetated fossil dunes that flatten out near the river, which is usually dry. The project is now part of the university's ""Large Animal Research Group"" headed by Tim Clutton-Brock, FRS, who has headed the Meerkat project since 1993. The project usually has 10–15 volunteers who form the main meerkat project staff. They are supervised by a Field Coordinator and a Field Manager. Volunteers come from all over the world and the project is regularly hiring volunteers (see http:www.kalahari-meerkats.comindex.php?id=volunteers). In addition to the core researchers, Earthwatch volunteers aid in collecting research data after being partnered with a staff researcher. There is also usually a South African technician responsible for project logistics, 6–8 post-graduate interns from Europe or South Africa, and a number of doctorate and independent researchers carrying out their own research in the area. There are rarely fewer than 10 people working in the project area at any given time. The principal investigators of the project are Prof. Tim Clutton-Brock, Professor of Animal Ecology at the University of Cambridge, and Prof. Marta Manser, Professor of Animal Behavior at the University of Zurich. The KMP study encompasses 16 groups of meerkats, with six living exclusively on the reserve and the rest having ranges that extend into the surrounding farmland. Most members of the groups are familiar enough with the human researchers that they are undisturbed by their presence and are relatively easy to touch and collect samples from. Extremely accurate life history records are kept for each meerkat in the study populations, including the recording of births, deaths, pregnancies, lactation and oestrus cycles, changes in social status and group affiliation, and any abnormal behaviors or activities. The project team offers film crews and wildlife photographers the chance to film the habituated groups of meerkats at the reserve. The KMP meerkats have been the subjects of several documentary programs, including: In May 2010, Lapland Studio announced it was releasing a video game entitled Lead the Meerkats for the Nintendo Wii and would be donating proceeds from copies sold on the first day to the project. Clutton-Brock and Evi Bauer, president of the Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat Project, expressed excitement over the games release as a way to educate people about meerkats through a fairly realistic game. ""Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat Project"" is a legally independent, but functionally integrated, sponsoring organization of the project that was founded in Switzerland on 23 November 2007. Through this website, the Kalahari Meerkat Project releases information about the meerkats, including life history updates for all of the individual meerkats and the meerkat groups being studied, updates on the current groups, historical information on lost groups, and basic information about meerkats. The project uploads its own photographs and video footage of the meerkats, available for viewing for free. In April 2008, the site began selling ""Friends"" packages to offer a way to support the project. The Friends package includes additional project information not published on the site, as well as detailed information comparing the actual project meerkats to their counterparts in Meerkat Manor. On 8 June 2008, the site was expanded to include a virtual store, powered by Zazzle, through which the project offers a variety of custom meerkat items. Proceeds from the items go to support the project and the Friends program.",Normal

"In much of the ""Old World"" (approximately Africa, Asia and Europe) the names of many places cannot easily be interpreted or understood; they do not convey any apparent meaning in the modern language of the area. This is due to a general set of processes through which place names evolve over time, until their obvious meaning is lost. In contrast, in the ""New World"" (roughly North America, South America, and Australasia), many place names' origins are known. Although the origin of many place names is now forgotten, it is often possible to establish likely meanings through consideration of early forms of the name. Some general conclusions about the nature of place names, and the way in which place names change, can be made and are examined below. It is also possible to distinguish regional trends and differences in the naming of places, as is also discussed below. There are several clearly definable types of place name, the primary division being between the names of natural features and the names of human settlements. That the latter are 'places' is obvious. The case is slightly more ambiguous for natural features, depending on how exactly 'place' is defined, and what exactly the concept of a 'place' is used for. If, as is probable, natural features were originally given names to distinguish nearby hills, streams etc. from each other, then these features can be thought of as places, in that they represent distinct geographic locations. However, as names are applied on a larger scale, they may become less useful as place names. For instance, a relatively small, distinct upland valley (e.g. Swaledale) clearly represents a definable geographic location. However, the broad, extended valley of a major river, such as the Trent, is not easily understood as a single location. That notwithstanding, it is probable that the origins of the names of both settlements and natural features is the same, namely to distinguish one from another; and thus that both should be considered place names. Many other types of place name can be defined, for example those relating to tribal or personal names. Previously names relating to pagan religion were extensively studied as these were thought to be early. Another class studied was those relating to particular people, example: the Ancient British. The place names also can be based upon the nature of the occupation of the people in that area or the particular function performed by the people in that area. There are identifiable processes which occur over time to place names, and which alter the place names in such a way that their original meanings are lost. These apply to both the names of settlements and natural features, although more so to the former. The processes by which place names change include abbreviation, conflation, convergence, development in the parent language (but stasis in the place name) and replacement of the parent language. The latter in particular can result in dramatic shifts in place names, since the original meaning (and often sounds) are not conveyed in the new language, the place name thus shifts to a form appropriate for the new language. Place names often need specialists to interpret their meanings. Some of the main problems are: The names of natural or man-made features in the landscape tend to be older than those of settlements since the former are often more widely known. Names are given to water features, hills and valleys, islands and marshes, as well as woods and districts. Man-made landscape features that have been given names include roads and trackways as well as burial mounds, etc. Many topographic elements become incorporated into settlement names, together with plant, creature names or personal names. Many topographical words convey not just an image of the place but also a wealth of information about the likely size, status and pattern of farming practised by the community living there. Water was of major importance to the early settlers of an area, both for subsistence and for religious reasons. Names were given to springs, streams, rivers and lakes as well as marshes, bays and seas. Eilert Ekwall carried out an early study of river names in England while Krahe conducted a European-wide examination of river names which showed that there were common roots in the names over a wide area. There is still controversy over the language of these roots. Sometimes a generic word was adopted as a specific label, for example the Celtic word for river was afon, which is used in many cases as the name (Avon) of rivers in England. Land characteristics were important to both hunters and farmers, and there are many terms relating to different types of hills and valleys. Some terms, like cumb and penn, were adopted from Celtic by Anglo-Saxons. Other terms relate to the expansion of farming. Topographical names were held in low esteem by early place name scholars but their importance was raised in a book by Margaret Gelling, first published in 1978. This discusses the many elements of topographical place names, with updates in 1988 and 1997. Most pre-modern settlement names contain a generic element describing the place's function (e.g. 'farm', 'market', 'fort') or a prominent natural feature, or both; if only one of these is present, it is often modified by a personal name or an adjective. For instance, examples from England: These basic elements can also be found in place names in other countries; e.g., Amsterdam ('River Amstel dam'), Liechtenstein ('Light-stone'), Copenhagen (equivalent to “chapmen’s haven”), Paris ('Home of the Parisii'), Shanghai (approximately 'Seaport'), Tashkent ('Stone city'). These elements are also clearly present in the less 'weathered' New World place names - e.g. Fort Knox, Thunder Bay, Little Rock and so on. Carson City, for instance, was named for Kit Carson, and Belo Horizonte means ""beautiful view"". However, some apparent meanings may be deceptive; New York was not directly named after the English city of York but after the Duke of York, who was the head of the British Navy at the time of the British take-over, and Los Angeles was not named after angels but after the Virgin Mary, or the Queen of the Angels (El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Angeles). Countries which have seen repeated large-scale cultural andor linguistic changes, such as England or France, tend to have more broken down place names, as the original meaning is forgotten and drifts more quickly. They may also have more linguistically diverse place names; for instance in England place names may have Pre-Celtic, Celtic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Norse, or Norman-French origins. Conversely, countries with a more uniform culturallinguistic history tend to have less broken down and diverse place names - Wales for instance (especially when compared to neighbouring England). Various names have been used for the island of Britain, see Britain (name). The origin of place names of the countries within Britain are discussed below. Each country is divided into a number of counties. Most English place-names are either Anglo-Saxon or Old Norse in origin but Celtic names are to be found over the whole country, most notably in Cornwall (see below) and counties bordering Wales. Other place-names are hybrids of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon elements. There is a high level of personal names within the place names, presumably the names of local landowners at the time of naming. In the north and east, there are many place names of Norse origin; similarly, these contain many personal names. In general, the Anglo-Saxon and Norse place names tend to be rather mundane in origin, the most common types being  or  (almost all towns ending in -wich, -ton, -ham, -by, -thorpe, -stokestock are of these types). In Shropshire and Herefordshire many Welsh place names are found in the borderlands such as Pontrilas and Trefonen. In Cornwall most place-names are Cornish in origin, whilst in Cumbria there remain a number of place names in Cumbric, the Brythonic language of this region; examples including Carlisle, Helvellyn and Blencathra. Most old Roman settlements, whether actually inhabited or not, were given the title of -chestercaster in Anglo-Saxon (from the Latin castrum, 'camp' or its plural form castra); the specific names for each may only have little relation to the Roman names (e.g. Chester - 'Deva', Winchester - 'Venta Belgarum' etc.). Many English places derive part of their name from the river upon which they were built, but in the 16th century many English rivers were renamed with back-formations from towns on their banks. Cambridge, perhaps uniquely, illustrates both effects: originally Grontabricc, a bridge on the Granta, the name became Cantebruge and then Cambrugge, from which the river was renamed Cam. The scholars of Oxford renamed the upper course of the River Thames running through Oxford to Dorchester-on-Thames as the ""Isis"", owing to an incorrect assumption that the Latin name of the river, Tamesis, represented a combination of ""Thame"" (a river that joins the Thames at Dorchester) and ""Isis"". One place in Yorkshire which retains Celtic toponymy is Pen-y-ghent (one of the Yorkshire Three Peaks), whose name means Hill-by-the-Border in Cumbric, a Brittonic language. The vast majority of place names in Wales are Welsh by origin, containing elements such as Llan-, Aber-, Pen- etc. Along the south coast of Wales, where English has historically been more widely spoken, many place names are commonly anglicized, such as Pontypool, derived from Pont-y-Pŵl. Many places throughout Wales have alternative names in English unrelated to the name in Welsh, for example, Newport (where the Welsh name Casnewydd means ""New Castle"") and Swansea (derived from the Norse meaning ""Svein's island"") for the Welsh Abertawe (Mouth of the River Tawe. In some cases these are in fact related to their Welsh name, but disguised through linguistic processes of mutation, for example Monmouth and the Welsh Trefynwy both referring to the River Monnow (Mon- < Monnow < Mynwy > -fynwy). Welsh place names tend to be associated with natural features rather than people, hence elements describing rivers, hills and valleys are common. The exceptions are places with the prefix Llan, meaning 'Church', which often contain the name of the Saint the church is dedicated to, e.g. Llansantffraid - 'Church of St. Bridget'. In the islands of Scotland, particularly Orkney and Shetland, but also the Western Isles, there are many names of Norse origin; this is also true on Caithness and other coasts of the mainland. In the Highlands, the names are primarily in Scottish Gaelic, with emphasis on natural features; elements such as Glen- (valley) and Inver- (confluence, mouth) are common. These have replaced Pictish names that still occur on the east coast. In lowland Scotland, names are of more diverse origin. Many are Gaelic, but many are also from the Brythonic branch of Celtic languages (such as Ayr). There are also place names from Old English and Scots, such as Edinburgh. Most place-names are of Gaelic or Norse origin but there are traces of an earlier language in some names. Most place names derive from Norman-French. The vast majority of placenames in Ireland are anglicizations (adaptations to English phonology) of Irish language names. However, some names come directly from the English language or Scots language, and a handful come from Old Norse. Place names in the United States are often taken from the European nation that first colonized the land. Many names that have been transferred from Britain, as is the case with Barnstable, Massachusetts and Danbury, Connecticut. Many others are of French origin, such as Detroit, Michigan, which was established along the banks of the river they called le détroit du lac Érié, meaning the strait of Lake Erie. Many in the former New Netherland colony are of Dutch origin, such as Harlem, Brooklyn and Rhode Island. Many place names are taken from the languages of native peoples. Specific (personal or animal) names and general words or phrases are used, sometimes translated and sometimes not. A great many names that appear to be Native American in origin were created by non-Natives with at best a rudimentary grasp of native languages. Pasadena, California's early Anglo residents, looking for a pleasant sounding (euphonious) name for the town, used the Ojibwe word pa-sa-de-na, which means of the valley. Similarly, Negaunee, Michigan's name is derived from the Ojibwe word nigani meaning foremost, in advance, leading, which was determined to be the closest Ojibwe approximation to the English word pioneer. Nine counties in the U.S. state of Michigan have names invented by Henry Schoolcraft, usually adapted from parts of Native American words, but sometimes having parts from Greek, Arabic and Latin roots. (see List of counties in Michigan.) In some cases the native meanings of a place name are wholly lost, despite guesses and theories, for example Tampa and Oregon. Place names in the United States tend to be more easily traceable to their origins, such as towns simply named after the founder or an important politician of the time, with no alterations except a simple suffix, like -town. Carson City, for instance, was named for Kit Carson. In the 21st century, real estate developers often conduct historical research in order to craft a name for a modern development that connects to the local history of the community.  French, English, Latin and Gaelic derived names occur in Canada. There are also Indigenous place names. Australian place names are mainly a mixture of Indigenous and British-derived toponyms. New Zealand place names derive mostly from Maori and from British sources. The Maori named most of New Zealand's natural features. When Europeans began arriving in New Zealand from the 17th century they gave their own names to many geographical features and settlements, often after places in Britain or important settlers or famous British people. Recently there has been a movement to revive some Maori names.",Normal
"Diskord is a band from Oslo. The band was started in 1999. Diskord's music can be categorized as doomy, progressivetechnical death metal, while several critics have labeled the band as hard to classify genre-wise. Nevertheless, their releases have been critically acclaimed, as for instance evidenced by Austin Weber's piece in the No Clean Singing webzine: ""Regardless of what comes out this year, I will be jamming Dystopics a lot; in retrospect. it’s my favorite death metal album from last year"", and their inclusion in Norwegian newspaper Tønsberg Blad's list of best albums of the year. The band has toured extensively and played a number of festivals including several appearances at the Inferno Metal Festival and by:Larm in Oslo, Mono Goes Metal and Kill-Town in Denmark, Old Grave fest in Bucharest, Hole in the Sky in Bergen, Szczecin Extreme Festival in Poland, Asakusa Deathfest in Japan. Diskord was supporting Nasum in Bologna and Possessed in Prague, Behemoth in South Africa, Johannesburg, toured with Dødheimsgard and Cryptic Brood in Europe. In 2020, the band signed to Transcending Obscurity Records for the release of their upcoming full-length album  ",Normal
"Wonderland Amusement Park (usually simply called Wonderland) was a trolley park that operated on the east side of Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, from 1906 to 1911. The park, near the intersection of East Washington Street and Gray Street, surrounded a lake and featured a Shoot-the-Chutes ride, a scenic railway ride, the signature 125-foot (38m)-tall Electric Tower, a ride that simulated the Johnstown Flood, a dirigible (""Kann's War Air-Ship""), a funhouse, a dance pavilion, and other exhibits and games in its 24 buildings. In addition to the standing attractions, the park also offered live exhibits and performances from bands, acrobats, animal acts, vaudeville acts, and members of a ""Filipino tribe"", the ""Igorrote."" Throughout its existence, Wonderland competed against the nearby Riverside Amusement Park to the west (in Riverside) and White City to the north (in Broad Ripple Park), with each park trying to top the other two with new attractions and activities each year. In 1909, Wonderland met local resistance when it announced its intentions to add a beer garden; when Wonderland management applied for a beer license, the Indianapolis Brewers Exchange was instrumental in obtaining the park's withdrawal of the application. In 1911, the park management started to operate a ""Blind Tiger"" establishment (one that sells alcohol without a license to do so); it was raided by the local police. On August 27, 1911, Wonderland burned to the ground; the park was never rebuilt. In the wake of the successful grand opening of Riverside Amusement Park in Indianapolis (1903), local residents Edward H. Rentsch and Minnie E. Wilson joined Milwaukee resident Richard Kann in a partnership that submitted corporation papers for the Wonderland Construction Company in November 1905. Their stated mission was to ""organize, promote and carry on pleasure resorts..."" and to build and maintain ""buildings, structures, appliances, machinery, and lawful devices adapted thereto, and to carry on and furnish lawful amusement at such resorts."" By the spring of 1906, construction of a park was started at the eastern edge of Indianapolis, near Irvington (which was later annexed by Indianapolis). The site, at the corner of East Washington and Gray Streets, covered two city blocks that once contained a baseball field. The park had its grand opening on a rainy May 19, 1906, with 8000 customers braving the elements (it took two hours to admit the crowd). Admission cost ten cents per adult, five for each child. The park's signature 125-foot (38m)-tall Electric Tower and scenic railroad greeted the crowds a week before the season's opening of Riverside Amusement Park and the grand opening of another nearby trolley park, White City, at a time in which the amusement park business was booming in the United States. Following the leads of the earliest Luna Parks (Coney Island, Pittsburgh, and Cleveland), Wonderland's grounds were bathed in the light of about 50,000 light bulbs. The park also employed a 100,000 watt searchlight. Customers passed through an arch (similar to that of the Luna Parks of the era) on which the park's name – ""Wonderland"" – was engraved (the park's offices were located on each end of the arch). Inside the grounds, the park's buildings were painted white with yellow trim, a nod to the original White City of the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. In addition to the Electric Tower (which people were encouraged to climb) and the one-quarter-mile-long scenic railroad (constructed by the L. A. Thompson Scenic Railway Company) featuring four elevated, intertwining, tracks, the crowds were treated to even more attractions. A Shoot-the-Chutes ride similar to that of the park's rivals proved popular, as did a funhouse (""The Third Degree""), a circle swing ride, a giant slide (""Bump the Bump"") that entertained adults and children alike, a Whip ride, and an exhibit that simulated the Johnstown Flood. A skating rink also proved popular, as did the arcade and the restaurants. Live entertainment quickly became Wonderland's chief drawing card, from the trick motorcyclists to bands, acrobats, vaudeville acts, to a display of Igorot people from the Philippines (advertised as ""a visit from the Igorrote tribe""). The park's elephant mascot bathed in the Shoot-the-Chutes lagoon, delighting many patrons. The exhibits and attractions changed almost constantly, even in Wonderland's first year of operation. The week of June 10, 1906, saw the arrival of Kann's War Airship (named after one of the park owners, Richard Kann), built in Indianapolis and temporarily moored at the park. Visitors viewed it for free in its aerodrome; it took brief flights, once in the morning, one in the evening, over the park each day while it was on exhibit. The year 1907 saw the arrival of equestrian acts and King Bill, touted as ""the greatest trained bull in the world"". King Bill made headlines when it was spooked by a blown band instrument, jumped off the platform upon which it was performing, and landed in the crowd. A new band shell adorned the park in Wonderland's second season, and a monkey house was built for 48 new simian acquisitions (following suit, Riverside Amusement Park added their own monkeys later that year). The acrobats and aerialists returned to Wonderland in 1907, including an albino aerialist (White City had another albino aerialist perform on it grounds shortly afterwards). Stunt bicyclists (which became a popular sensation at the time) replaced stunt motorcyclists on the performing stage. In addition to the acrobats, live entertainment at Wonderland frequently included animal acts. The aforementioned monkeys, horses, and Big Bill were augmented by trained lions, ostriches, alligators, and elephants in 1907. As the competition among the three Indianapolis parks continued to heat up, Riverside Amusement Park reduced its advertising and reduced its expenditures of constantly updating the park and White City started emphasizing its natural features at Broad Ripple Park to try to maintain its customer base in the light of Indianapolis' slow decrease in entertainment dollars. Wonderland, the only major Indianapolis park not to have water access was forced to maintain its costly routine of renovating and upgrading itself and introducing new rides and attractions, making its continuing existence more and more problematic. The three parks had drawn a combined one million patrons in 1906–1907. Increasing costs of construction of new rides and attractions, coupled with an increasing need to advertise, eventually forced a change of ownership of Wonderland. The Wonderland Construction Company gave way to a new publicly owned corporation, the Wonderland Amusement Company; the officers include Indianapolis resident E. I. Fisher (also the president of Capital Paper Company) as president of Wonderland, Frank M. Talbott (Indianapolis Basket Company), A. Lehman (Indianapolis Paper Box Company), and park general manager Frank M. Wicks. Capital stock was issued in an effort to maintain profitability. The new ownership wasted no time in upgrading Wonderland, adding eight attractions in 1908. In addition to a new restaurant, the ""Flatiron"" proved to be an instant success as the new building offered ""human squirrel cake"", and trick floors, carpets, and ceilings (the Flatiron was advertised as a ""show"" geared to those who wished ""harmless excitement with a touch of terror."" New features include ""Brewster's Millions"" (inspired by the popular novel by George Barr McCutcheon), ""Ray's Manikans"", ""The Tickler,"" ""Battle Royal"" and the ""Old Swimmin' Hole."" The restaurant patrons enjoyed their sodas as they enjoyed the live entertainment that was a mainstay of the park. Vaudeville shows were the primary source of entertainment, augmented with performances of Sleight's Military Band. In June 1908, Millie Spellman brought her drinking and cigarette-smoking bears to Wonderland as the Teddy bear craze was beginning to take hold in the United States. The initial reaction to the new attractions kept the park's precarious finances hidden as rival parks found new ways to preserve the bottom line. White City also introduced new attractions and finished its construction of a huge swimming pool (covering two acres, it was scheduled to open June 27); Riverside Amusement Park sharply reduced its construction and advertising costs, opting to rely upon the rides it had the previous year and showcasing ""the world's largest steer."" The night of June 26, 1908, Wonderland's competition lessened as White City was destroyed by fire. Only the swimming pool, scheduled to open the following morning, was left: it had its grand opening the following week (July 4, 1908). The same day, Wonderland had its largest attendance in its history for its annual Independence Day festivities. Such a turnout encouraged the ownership to develop expansion plans, some of which were leaked to the public in the latter months of 1908... including that of building a beer garden. When the plans were officially announced (March 1909), Wonderland was embroiled in controversy unlike any it had encountered before. Flush with the success of 1908, ownership moved forward with expansion plans for Wonderland, moving eastward toward Irvington, an Indianapolis suburb (since merged into the larger city) that prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages within its city limits. By mid-March, the already-wary neighbors became alarmed when the rumored plans for a new beer garden on the newly extended park property were confirmed. On March 23, a petition drive by a coalition of area mother's groups (""Send a Petition to Wonderland"") was reported by the Indianapolis News. The mother's groups, assisted by members of various regional temperance groups, requested that Wonderland withdraw its application for a liquor license and asserted that the detrimental effects of liquor would not only adversely affect those who would attend the park but also those who ""would no longer patronize the resort."" The next day, the application was withdrawn. Instead of a German beer garden, a German Village would be installed instead. While the park announcement publicly acknowledge the petitions, the deciding point was made by the Indianapolis Brewers Exchange, whose truckers started boycotting the park once the controversy arose. The brewers, fearful of the brouhaha spreading to them, united behind the truckers and the mother's groups. The contretemps did not help the park's attempt to battle a national trend of declining amusement park traffic. By the middle of the 1909 season, attendance had become so poor that the park no longer maintained a full-time operating schedule. Eventually, the park would open only for ""special events"" in which various organizations would rent the grounds and equipment for private parties. In 1909–1911, the primary patron was the International Interdenominational County Fair, with the proceeds of the festivities benefitting the Summer Mission for Sick Children, a local charity. The fair's organizers were responsible for promotion, stating in its ads for the 1911 fair that Wonderland had newly renovated its Shoot-the-Chutes and scenic railway rides. The 1911 International Interdenominational County Fair started positively, drawing the park's largest crowds since 1908 for the first three days. The sixth day of the fair was overshadowed by a police raid of the German Village. The park had been ""teasing"" the public about a new attraction, the ""Blind Tiger,"" for weeks. Peter B. Trone, manager of the about-to-be-opened attraction, stated to the local media that his establishment would be the only ""wet"" place in the park (despite not having a licence to sell alcoholic beverages). Knowing that ""blind tiger"" was code for an establishment that sold alcohol illegally, the Indianapolis Police Department conducted a raid of the premises on its opening day, August 17, 1911. Trone thwarted the raid as he delayed the police entry as the bartenders hid the illicit beverages as the customers drank ginger ale chasers and then mopped their lips. After finding insufficient evidence to arrest anybody in the facility, the police promised an additional raid should the ""Blind Tiger"" remain in business. The County Fair completed its 1911 run at Wonderland the next day without further incident. It was the penultimate engagement for Wonderland as the end of the season (the last week in August) was in sight. The first time that Wonderland advertised in media geared toward African Americans (in the August 26, 1911 Indianapolis Recorder) also proved to be their last. After a week in which the park was set aside for the exclusive use of the Colored Pythians, the ad announced that the following day was the last of the 1911 season and (contrary to attendance policies of any of the Indianapolis amusement parks) Wonderland would be ""open exclusively for colored people."" The day was a success, and the Colored Pythians held a celebration and left the park before the gates had closed at 11:00pm Less than two hours later, the park's night watchman observed flames and notified the local fire department. One half-hour later, the first fire truck arrived as the merry-go-round and the Shoot-the-Chutes were already burning. By 3:00am the park was completely involved in flames. By dawn, the firemen had put out the last of the fire, but virtually everything in the park was destroyed, and Wonderland would never reopen. Authorities assumed that the fire was sparked by a discarded cigarette.",Normal
"The film industry in Albania comprises the art of films and movies made within the country or by Albanian directors abroad. Albania has had an active cinema industry since 1897 and began strong activities in 1940 after the foundation of both the ""Kinostudio Shqipëria e Re"" and National Center of Cinematography in Tirana. Early Albanian films were introduced in Albania in 1909 by painter and photographer Kolë Idromeno in Shkodër. Afterwards, the first public screening of foreign films took place over the years. The motion pictures have won international and prestigious awards and each year new Albanian films are seen at film festivals around the globe. In consideration to the Albanian diaspora, there are several internationally renowned actors such as the Albanian-Americans Eliza Dushku, Klement Tinaj, Masiela Lusha, Jim and John Belushi, Kosovo-Albanians Bekim Fehmiu and Arta Dobroshi and Turkish-Albanian Barish Arduç. Albania annually hosts several International Film Festivals. The most important is certainly the Tirana International Film Festival, which takes place in the capital of Tirana. Born in 2008, the Durrës International Film Festival is also among the most prominent exhibitions held in summer at the Amphitheatre of Durrës. During China's Cultural Revolution, many Chinese audience members were introduced to avant-garde and modernist storytelling techniques and aesthetics through Albanian film.: 206–207",Normal
"Anne Heaton is an American pop-influenced folk singer-songwriter and pianist from New York City. She majored in liberal studies at the Notre Dame, and grew up in the Chicago suburb of Wilmette. She regularly toured with ""Live from New York"" on the eastern coast of the United States. In 2007, Heaton moved to Boston, and generally tours and performs with multi-instrumentalist Frank Marotta. Anne Heaton grew up in Wilmette, IL, a suburb of Chicago and started playing piano at the age of 3. She was trained in classical music and turned down a scholarship to study at Boston's Berklee School of Music in classical piano. In an interview with The New York Times Online, Heaton said she gave up classical piano because she found it too inhibiting and exact. Thinking she would one day be a philosophy professor, Heaton pursued philosophy and theology at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. Heaton sang in a cover band in college and later found her calling in music and songwriting. She cites Peter Gabriel, Tori Amos and The Indigo Girls as her biggest influences. After college, Heaton made her way to NYC. There she played in a Latin band and sang in a gospel choir in Harlem. Heaton's debut release in 2002, Black Notebook, was met with critical acclaim and garnered ""Top DIY Pick"" from Performing Songwriter magazine. In 2004, she released Give In, which she created in collaboration with Mike Denneen. Her second release, Give In, in 2005 was called ""tender, amusing, barbed and spiritual by turns"" by The Washington Post. Heaton toured extensively across the US in support of her albums.

"John Peter Joseph Sturm (January 23, 1916 – October 8, 2004) was a Major League Baseball player. He played with the New York Yankees during the 1941 season as their starting first baseman. Sturm was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1916. He attended Roosevelt High School in St. Louis and also played semi-pro baseball. Sturm started his professional career in 1936 in the New York Yankees organization. In 1939 and 1940, he played for the American Association's Kansas City Blues alongside the double play combination of Phil Rizzuto and Jerry Priddy. The Blues won two league championships, and Sturm hit over .300 in both seasons. He joined the Yankees in 1941, replacing Babe Dahlgren at first base. Sturm sat on the bench early in the season but broke into the lineup after the other infielders – including Hall of Famers Rizzuto and Joe Gordon – got off to slow starts. Sturm hit just .239 for the Yankees but still batted first in the lineup the rest of the way. He later claimed to have a back injury that year. He did, however, hit .286 in the 1941 World Series; the Yankees defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers in five games. After the season, Sturm enlisted in the United States Army and served in World War II. He was out of professional baseball from 1942 to 1945 and lost the tip of his right index finger in a tractor accident. In 1946, Sturm tried to come back to the major leagues but broke his wrist. He played and managed in the minors for the rest of the decade, hitting .360 for the Joplin Miners in 1948. The Yankees also assigned him to scout in the Kansas-Oklahoma-Missouri region. In this capacity, Sturm became the man who first recommended Mickey Mantle to the Yankees. He invited Mantle to try out for Joplin in 1949, and sportswriter Allen Barra writes, ""It's likely he was the one who spurred Lee MacPhail into moving aggressively to sign Mantle."" Sturm retired as a player-manager in 1949. In later years, he was a scout for the Houston Colt .45s, Cincinnati Reds, and Boston Red Sox. He was elected into the Greater St. Louis Hall of Fame. Sturm was married and had three children. He died of congestive heart failure in 2004.",Normal
"Jefferson R. Burdick (1900–1963) was an American electrician and a collector of printed ephemera, including postcards, posters, cigar bands, and other types of printed materials dating from the mid-nineteenth century to the early 1960s. He is best known for collecting trading and baseball cards in The American Card Catalog, otherwise known as the ACC. Burdick is often considered to be the greatest card collector in history, and has been called ""The Father of Card Collecting."" He was born in Central Square, New York in 1900. Growing up on a farm, Burdick began collecting cards from soda and tobacco companies as a child, and asked his father to smoke different cigarette brands so he could collect them all. Burdick graduated from Central High School in 1918, and worked as a farm laborer with his family before attending Syracuse University in late 1920. In 1922, he received a two-year business degree from Syracuse University. He held a variety of jobs after graduation, including working in advertising at The Syracuse Herald before becoming an electrician, which was his primary occupation. He developed arthritis during his thirties, which continued to affect him throughout his life. Burdick became interested in collecting again in 1933, when he began amassing cards and stamps in earnest. Beginning in 1937, he published a Card Collectors Bulletin. He established his system of cataloguing cards in the CCB. In total, he collected around 306,000 cards which he glued into 394 albums. The reasons why Burdick chose to glue his cards into albums is unknown, as he advised collectors to use corner mounting to preserve cards in the CCB. George Vrechek, in ""Burdick Revisted"", theorizes that Burdick chose glue to ensure that cards were not lost and the collection remained complete so that posterity could enjoy it. By 1940, Burdick was living as a lodger with a Syracuse family and earned a salary of $1,065 per year as an assembler at Crouse-Hinds Company. Despite his meager wages, he continued to spend the majority of his earnings on publishing his bulletins and growing his collection. Burdick donated his entire collection to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1947. Writing in 1948, he stated his belief that it should be ""a national collection belonging to everybody."" That year, he created a guide to the collection with art historian A. Hyatt Mayor that explains the background and organization of the collection. He retired from Crouse-Hinds in 1959 due to disability, and moved to Madison Avenue where he could be closer to the Met. Burdick spent 15 years working at the museum's drawings and prints department to accomplish the task of cataloging the collection, which he finished in January 1963. He was hospitalized at Bellevue Hospital in 1962. He died the following year. In 2018, Burdick was posthumously awarded the Henry Chadwick Award by the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR). SABR also created the ""Jefferson Burdick Award for Contributions to the Hobby"". The Jefferson R. Burdick collection is the second largest public collection of baseball cards, second only to that of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. A small part of the collection is on display at the museum on the first floor of the American Wing. Burdick’s donation to the museum included over 300,000 items; however, only a small percentage of the items donated by Burdick were baseball cards. The Burdick system is still widely used today by collectors and dealers of baseball memorabilia. The famed T206 baseball card set received its popularized name from the set's designation in the ACC. Many other baseball card sets are popularly known by their ACC designation, including: T205, E93, M116 and R313. This biographical article relating to an American baseball figure is a stub.

"Swyer–James syndrome (SJS), also called Swyer-James-MacLeod syndrome, is a disease of the lungs, characterized by a small lung or part of lung. Typical symptoms are of recurrent respiratory tract infections, but some have no symptoms. As a result of childhood bronchiolitis obliterans, typically following adenovirus infection, there is a reduction in blood vessels and overextended alveoli, resulting in air trapping in one or part of one lung. It is rare. Often, there are no symptoms and the disease is detected when investigating another problem. Sometimes there is shortness of breath on exertion, wheeze, reduced ability to exercise, cough and chest pain. Swyer–James syndrome is a manifestation of postinfectious obliterative bronchiolitis. In SJS, the involved lung or portion of the lung does not grow normally and is slightly smaller than the opposite lung. The characteristic radiographic appearance is that of pulmonary hyperlucency, caused by overdistention of the alveoli in conjunction with diminished arterial flow. and has been linked to adenovirus type 21, a type of adenovirus infection. In appearance Swyer–James normally leaves shadowing in a CT scan in the upper lobar regions of one or (rarely) both lungs. People with the illness operate in much the same way as patients with mild bronchiectasis. As a result, the illness can go undiagnosed for some time. With current pharmaceutical developments, the prognosis is good for sufferers of the illness to lead normal and healthy lives. It was found by English chest physician William Mathiseon MacLeod, and (simultaneously) by physician Paul Robert Swyer and radiologist George James in the 1950s in Canada.",Normal
"The Sindh Information Department is a good department of the government of the province of Sindh in southern Pakistan. The main functions of the Sindh Information Department are to provide better and purposeful coverage to the activities of government, through both electronic and print media, for which purpose the department coordinates with the media and journalists. It communicates daily with the Governor, the Chief Secretary's administrative departments, and other government functionaries, regarding relevant press coverage. Weekly reports of television coverage of Sindh are also made. The press information section issues handouts, denials and clarifications to the print and electronic media, which normally get prominent coverage in national and regional news. Press briefings by various administrative officers are made at news conferences, and interviews with senior government officers are arranged regularly to highlight developmental activities as well as efforts to improve law and order, the campaign of anti-terrorist activity, and other steps taken by the Government of Sindh. A media projection plan, which focuses on the following points for proper and better projection of government activities, has been circulated to all departmental offices: If the above guidelines are followed by the departmental offices concerned, it is expected that Sindh Government's coverage will occupy the major portion of print media, because the number of officers who have to hold open Katcheries every month and involve themselves in other activities of public importance, exceeds 100 This section also arranges photographic coverage of official engagements of the Governor, the Sindh Chief Minister's advisor, Chief Secretary, administrative secretaries and other functionaries of various departments The monthly publications of the Information Department, namely ""Izhar"" (Urdu) and ""Paigham"" (Sindhi), which ceased in 1993, have been re-published since May, 1999. Efforts are underway to market them through the usual trading outlets. This section has also been fully reorganised. It now keeps government and semi-government departments informed of the miseries and hardships of people who make their wishes known to the relevant authorities through the print media. In keeping with this policy, press clippings regarding public demands and complaints, law and order, political statements (positive or negative), editorials, articles and news items of public interest are submitted to the chief executive of the province. Press clippings of different nature are also sent to the media advisor and the chief secretary. Besides the above, press clippings pertaining to various Nation Building Departments, are sent daily to the heads of administrative departments for their attention. The rebuttals and clarifications received from the concerned departments are also sent to the print media for publicising the government's point of view. This section processes advertisements placed in newspapers by various Sindh Government departments. A revised advertising policy was approved in 2000 by the provincial cabinet of Sindh. This policy is aimed at economising on space and cutting down expenditure drastically. Several daily newspapers for which the Information Department processes government advertising, as well as those on the central media list approved by the federal government and certified by ABC, have been shortlisted in consultation with ISPR and APNS to contain releases of advertisements to dummy newspapers. A review committee, headed by the Deputy Director, ISPR, 5 Corps Headquarters, Karachi, has also been constituted to undertake periodical reviews of newspapers for the release of government advertisements. The Information Department owes some Rs.134.22 million for advertising, unpaid due to lack of funding. In order to settle the outstanding dues, the Finance Department has so far provided a sum of Rs.60 million, out of which about Rs.20 million has been disbursed, while the remaining amount is being drawn from the audit. The disbursement of payment is processed and approved by the committee headed by the Deputy Director, ISPR, 5 Corps Headquarters, Karachi, and represented by the Finance Department by the Deputy Secretary. This section of the Sindh Information Department provides professional training and financial support to journalists as well as certifying the journalists at the provincial level. It also issues accreditation cards to journalists.

This section has been completely reorganized to keep monitoring the English, Urdu and Sindhi press, a summary of which is prepared and sent on daily to the Governor, Chief Secretary and Log Area Headquarters. Weekly and monthly progress reports of the activities being carried out by the Information Department, including the Divisional Headquarters, are also dealt with by this department. The following additional functions are also the responsibility of press section:- The now defunct West Pakistan Press and Publication Ordinance 1963, and the Registration of Printing Press and Publications Ordinance 1990, remained in force until 1996 when, on 2 November 1996, a new ordinance, the Press and Publication Ordinance, was promulgated. The ordinance of 1996, having not been extended, lapsed under the provisions of article 89 of the Constitution of Pakistan. According to the Advocate General, Sindh, the ""previous ordinance of 1963 has automatically been revived by virtue of Article 264 of the Constitution of Pakistan."" This view has been endorsed by the Law Department. The above law is being considered by the press as black law. The matter was discussed in the inter-provincial ministers' conference held on 12 February 1999, which had decided to examine and suggest amendments (if any) in the drafts of the following proposed laws: a) Press Protection and Facilitation Act, 1997 (which would repeal the defunct West Pakistan Press and Publications Ordinance, 1990) b) Press Council and Enforcement of Code of Ethics for Press, Publications and News Agencies Act The draft comments offered by the Information Department, Government of Sindh, duly vetted by the Law Department, were sent to the Ministry of Information and Media Development, Government of Pakistan. The matter was also discussed in the consultative and coordination meeting held on 8 February 2000, in which the need for creating a law for news agencies was acknowledged. The divisional and district offices perform the same functions at the divisional or district level with which constant coordination is maintained to monitor activity. The Sindh Information Department has strong and close relations with print media, as well as enhancing electronic media of the country in manipulating public opinion. The film section of the department is working closely with electronic media. It can help in educating the masses. The mobile film unit of the department held film shows at various places in the interior of Sindh. These shows were evoked interest in a large number of people. The Sindh Information Department provides more films and news to PTV because it a national television channel, but the trend is rapidly changing with the emergence of private television channels. The Department is enjoying influential relations with the national television broadcaster (PTV). The Sindh Information Department provides news to Pakistan radio in the same way it does for television insofar as it provides comparatively more news for Pakistan national radio than it does for private FM radio stations.",Normal

"A blech (from the Yiddish word בלעך (blekh) meaning ""tin"" or ""sheet metal"") is a metal sheet used by many observant Jews to cover stovetop burners (and for some, the cooker's knobs and dials) on Shabbos (the Jewish Sabbath), as part of the precautions taken to avoid violating the halachic prohibition against cooking on the Sabbath. Rabbi Fishel Jacobs' The Blech Book—The Complete & Illustrated Guide To Shabbos Hotplates gives the following guidelines: During Shabbos, the pots are removed according to need. After removal, it is permissible to return the pot onto the blech, following these guidelines: The permissibility of blech (and unblech, below) and the acceptable manner of their use is questioned by several modern kashrut organizations; however, the use of a blech to reheat food on the Sabbath remains very popular among observant Jews. An unblech, or K'Deira Blech (lit. ""pot blech"", commonly referred to as ""water blech""), is also used to heat up pre-cooked food on the Sabbath, but utilizes different halakhic mechanisms from a standard blech. An unblech consists of a shallow metal pan filled with hot water and covered by another metal pan, and thus is akin to a bain-marie or double boiler for halakhic purposes. As such, it may be more flexible than a standard blech for halachic purposes. However, the temperature of an unblech is limited by the boiling point of water and is not as hot as a typical blech. In 2015, a house fire caused by a faulty Shabbos hot plate killed seven children in Brooklyn. The 2015 fire was preceded by at least four other Shabbos fires in Brooklyn in the past 15 years caused by appliances for heating food being left on or candles burning during the Jewish Sabbath in order to comply with Orthodox interpretation of Jewish Law. In 2005, three children died in a fire in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, caused when stove burners were left on during Passover. After the 2015 fire, the New York City Fire Department distributed a pamphlet titled ""Fire Safety for Jewish Observances"" to nearby homes. In response to the fire, many Jewish Brooklyn residents purchased smoke detectors before the following Sabbath.",Normal

"During the 1902–03 English football season, Brentford competed in the Southern League First Division. An appalling season led to a bottom-place finish in the First Division, but the Bees retained their First Division status with a victory over Second Division champions Fulham in a promotion-relegation test match. After a rude awakening to the Southern League First Division during the previous season and despite having become a professional club in 1900, the Brentford committee continued with an amateur attitude with regards to the running of first team affairs. Despite almost all of the First Division clubs utilising a first team manager, the committee would continue to run first team affairs. Had Brentford been relegated at the end of the previous season, the £557 loss on the season (equivalent to £64,300 in 2024) would have spelt the end of the club, but attendances had almost doubled at York Road and gate receipts of £1,244 were taken (£143,700 in 2024). Frustratingly, Brentford's promotion to the First Division had necessitated a trebling of the wage bill, which offset the increased gate receipts. To increase revenue, the club would also enter into the London League and Western League during the season and the squad was expanded to 26 professionals, which led to a 60% expansion of the wage bill. Previous regulars Grieve, Logan, McEleny, McElhaney and captain Stormont all left the club and were replaced by full backs Gilson, Nidd, half backs Green, Newsome and forwards Maher, Pickering, Turner and Underwood. Brentford began the First Division season in even worse form than it had the last, losing the first 9 matches. Bristol City trainer Bob Crone was brought in to replace Tom King and while the team's fitness improved, its form did not. The FA Cup provided a welcome distraction and the team's form belied that of in the league, scoring 16 goals in six matches to advance from the third qualifying round to the intermediate round and a matchup with Football League First Division club Woolwich Arsenal. The Bees took the Gunners to a replay at the Manor Ground, but the run ended with a 5–0 defeat. While the cup exploits had inspired Brentford to a first league victory of the season on 22 November 1902, it had raised the profile of forward Tommy Shanks, who had scored in 9 goals in a 10-match spell through November and December 1902. 1903 began with the shock transfer of Tommy Shanks to Woolwich Arsenal, with Brentford receiving £200 and forward Joe Connor, who on 21 March 1903 would become Brentford's first international player when he played and scored for Ireland in a 2–0 victory over Scotland. The Bees took just 3 points from a possible 34 during the rest of the season and finished bottom of the First Division, which led to a promotion-relegation test match versus Second Division champions Fulham on 28 April. The team put in its best performance of the season to run out 7–2 victors, with Joe Connor scoring four goals. Statistically, 1902–03 was Brentford's worst Southern League season, winning just twice and drawing once. A number of club records were set or equalled during the season: Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.

"The B&F Fk14 Polaris, also called the FK-Lightplanes FK14, is a single-engine, low-wing ultralight aircraft that seats two side by side. Designed in Germany in the late 1990s, it remains in production as of 2011. The Cirrus SR Sport, simply called the Cirrus SRS, was a version of the B&F Fk14 Polaris that was intended to be marketed as a light-sport aircraft by U.S.-based aircraft manufacturer Cirrus Design (now called Cirrus Aircraft), and was promoted from 2007 until its suspension in 2009 during the economic crisis. Design of the B&F Fk14 Polaris, sometimes known as the Funk Fk 14 Polaris but not by its makers, began in 1998. It first flew in May 1999 and started in production the next year. It is a low-wing, single-engine ultralight, with enclosed accommodation for two seated side by side. Its largely glass fibre (carbon on the Fk14B variant) wing is mostly of parallel chord but toward the tips, where short span aluminium ailerons occupy the trailing edges, the leading edge is swept. Electrically operated Fowler flaps are fitted. Four flap settings are available: +0°, +10°, +20° and +32°. The wingtips incorporate short winglets. The fin and rudder are gently swept; the rudder is deep, reaching the lower fuselage line and moving in a cutout between the elevators. These rear flying surfaces are mass-balanced. The Polaris also has spring-trimmed controls. Until 2007 B&F offered a choice of steel framed or monocoque fuselage structures, but since then have produced only the latter. The occupants sit side by side under a single piece, forward-hinged canopy. The standard undercarriage is of tricycle configuration, though a conventional undercarriage is an option. The main legs are fuselage mounted spring cantilevers and the nosewheel is steerable. All wheels are spatted. The Polaris may be fitted with a ballistic parachute (BRS 5) as an option. There is a choice between two of the Rotax 912 series flat four-cylinder engines: either the 60kW (80hp) 912 UL or the 74kW (99hp) 912 ULS may be fitted. These engines drive three-blade, ground adjustable pitch propellers. At EAA AirVenture Oshkosh 2007, the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Cirrus Design announced that they intended to market a version of the Fk14 as the Cirrus SR Sport, also known as the Cirrus SRS. First deliveries were initially planned for mid-2008. In early 2008, the company began taking orders for delivery, with a $5,000 deposit required. Cirrus Design's then-CEO, Alan Klapmeier, announced in October 2008 that, due to the economic situation and resulting lack of demand for Cirrus aircraft, the company was moving to a three-day work week and that the introduction of the Cirrus SRS had been delayed due to a lack of demand in the light sport aircraft (LSA) market sector. In April 2009, the company announced that it was suspending the project, citing economic conditions and the need to develop the airplane and expand flight-training strategy. They also stated that with time the LSA rules are expected to change and allow Cirrus to build an LSA with a broader mission profile. As of February 2022, a full-scale mockup of the Cirrus SRS is located at the Duluth Children's Museum in Duluth, Minnesota, donated to the museum by Cirrus for visitors to learn and interact with. The 90th Polaris was completed in September 2008. In mid-2010, the European registers (excluding Russia) listed 72 aircraft.

"Viscount Ogawa Mataji (小川又次, 22 August 1848 – 20 October 1909) was a general in the early Imperial Japanese Army. He was also the father-in-law of Field Marshal Gen Sugiyama. Ogawa was born to a samurai family; his father was a retainer to the daimyō of Kokura Domain, in what is now Kitakyushu, Fukuoka. He studied rangaku under Egawa Hidetatsu and fought as a Kokura samurai against the forces of Chōshū Domain during the Bakumatsu period.

Greene praised the saloon shindy and horseback race scenes, and commended Palmer's acting, however his primary criticism was that ""it shrinks into significance, with its conventional love-story and the impression it leaves that the building of a railway depends on the heroic efforts of one or three men and a girl"".

"Robert Young was a stern-wheel driven steamboat that operated on the Columbia and Willamette rivers from 1918 to 1935. This vessel was originally named Nespelem, and operated under that name until 1920. From 1920 to 1935, this vessel was owned by the Western Transportation Company or one of its subsidiaries, and was employed primarily in service to paper mills. Robert Young was originally named Nespelem. Nespelem was built in 1918 for the Miller Navigation Company at Wenatchee, Washington. Nespelem was completed in December 1917. Nespelem was one of the last two steamboats to be constructed in the Wenatchee stretch of the Columbia River The other steamer was the Bridgeport, (438 tons, 121.5 feet) built at Pateros, Washington. The Miller Navigation Company was organized by three experienced steamboat men, Capt. Charles S. Miller, A.E. Davidson, and W.H. Gatward, all of whom were residents of Spokane, Washington. The authorized capitalization of the company was $50,000. Miller was to be the president and Davidson would be the secretary and chief engineer. In May 1917 Miller Navigation Co. announced that it had its first steamer under construction, at Kelso, Washington a considerable distance away from its intended operations on the upper Columbia River. This steamer was expected to be ready for service between July 15 and August 1, 1917. It would carry 200 tons of cargo, and when empty would draw about 20 inches of water. When loaded, the vessel would draw four and one-half feet. The company intended to operate from a down river connection at Brewster, Washington, where it would connect with the northern terminus of the Great Northern Railway. Alternatively, the downriver terminus would be at Pateros, Washington where there were better wharf facilities. The upper end of the anticipated route would be at Grand Rapids, which was about five mlles downstream from Kettle Falls, Washington. It was about 180 miles from Pateros to Grand Rapids. Other backers of the Miller Navigation Company were the Porter brothers, who were well-known railroad contractors who owned land in the area of Hunter, Washington. When built as Nespelem, the vessel was 130.5ft (39.8m) measured over the hull, and exclusive of the fantail, which was the overhanging extension of the main deck over the stern, on which the sternwheel was mounted. Including the fantail, the steamer was 154ft (46.9m) long. The sternwheeler had a beam (width) of 26.1ft (8.0m), measured over hull, and exclusive of the heavy wooden protective timbers running along the upper sides of the hull called the guards. The depth of hold was 5.2ft (1.58m). Nespelem required about two and one half feet depth of water to float in. The steamer’s official merchant vessel registry number was 215759. Total crew required for the vessel was 14. The machinery for Nespelem was built by the Willamette Iron and Steel Works and had been originally installed in the sternwheeler Ione. The twin horizontally-mounted steam engines installed at construction generated 185 indicated horsepower. Each single-cylinder engine had an inside cylinder diameter, called a “bore” of 14 inches. Each cylinder drove a piston with a stroke of 72 inches. Top speed of the steamer under favorable conditions was about 18 miles an hour. The engines and machinery were advertised as generating 600 horsepower. Nespelem was built In Wenatchee, Washington, at the foot of Orondo Avenue. It was launched on October 22, 1917. On launch day, Mrs. A.C. Gibson, sister-in-law of the builder, Charles S. Miller, broke a bottle of champagne over the bow as spectators cheered. There was still more work to be done before the steamer could be placed in service. No cabin structure had yet been built, and the machinery still had to be installed. However the boiler, the machinery, and the material for the stern-wheel had already arrived at Wenatchee. Following construction, which had been directed by veteran shipbuilder Joseph Paquet, of Portland, Oregon, Nespelem was worked on runs between points on the Columbia River north of Wenatchee. Nespelem was reported to have made four trips to Hunter’s Landing, at the mouth of the Spokane River, with the route proving unprofitable. Nespelem was intended to carry ore, but World War I disrupted the company’s plans, and Nespelem was brought down the Columbia River to Portland, Oregon, where it was sold to the Western Transportation & Towing Company. The 1919 merger of Western Transportation & Towing and Willamette Navigation Company brought Nespelem under the control of the new company, Western Transportation Co. Western Transportation Company in turn was a subsidiary of the Crown Willamette Paper Company. The Porter brothers had hoped to use Nespelem for hauling apples and other produce, but after a few trips proved that there was not enough business to support the expenses of the steamer. A decision was made to sell the steamer and move it downriver to Portland, Oregon. Nespelem started downriver from Pateros, at 8:00a.m. on Wednesday, August 14, 1918. The distance to Portland, Oregon was about 750 river miles. Capt. Charles S. Miller was in command. The most difficult parts of the run were at Priest Rapids, about 90 miles upriver from Pasco, Washington, and Rock Island, which was about 60 miles upriver from Priest Rapids, and 13 miles downstream from Wenatchee. Nespelem ran the Rock Island Rapids on August 14, and was only the third steamer to pass safely through those rapids. The steamer was able to make an average speed of 12 miles per hour downriver to The Dalles, Oregon, after which the speed was increased to an average of 16 miles per hour, even in the face of a strong head wind. Nespelem arrived in Portland at 6:45p.m. on Saturday evening, August 17, 1918. The plan upon arrival was to seek to have Nespelem chartered to the People’s Navigation Company, commonly called the People’s Line. The steamer was not entirely complete when it arrived in Portland. On October 8, 1918, negotiations with the People’s Line were reported to have been completed. Work was to be begun immediately to refit Nespelem for general freight and passenger service for the run between Portland and The Dalles. The People’s Line was already operating the Tahoma and (under charter from the Regulator Line) the Dalles City on this route. Once the conversion work on Nespelem was complete, it would replace Dalles City, which would be returned to the Regulator Line. The deal with the People’s Line appears not to have gone through, at least not immediately. From the 14th of October 1918 through the 31st of that same money, the Miller Navigation Company solicited bids for the sale of the steamer, which lay at the Taylor Street dock in Portland. By December 1918, Nespelem was reported to be running for the People’s Line. On the night of December 11, 1918, Nespelem arrived from The Dalles, carrying 6,000 boxes of apples, much of which was for the Portland market, but other parts were intended to be loaded on rail cars to be shipped east, including the European market. The steamboat business on the Columbia River encountered hard times in 1919. New automobile highways took tourists off the excursion boats, and the construction of the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway along the north bank of the river eliminated the need for steamboat service to the once isolated landings on that bank. In March 1919, Nespelem became part of a plan for a new service on the Columbia river. This new service would be inaugurated by a new company, The Dalles-Columbia River Line. This company was formed by Capt. Charles Nelson, who had baen master of the Tahoma for several years, and was then the manager of the Peoples line, together with John D. Porter, and, of Spokane, F.W. Anderson and F.W. Buswell, as well as J.C. Egbert of The Dalles, and J.T. Peters of Portland. Portland lawyer George F. Shepherd would be counsel for the corporation. The plan was, operating in conjunction with the sternwheeler Tahoma, to run to Pasco, Washington, and en route, call at Wallula, Washington, which would be a terminus for a truck service carrying agricultural products from Walla Walla, about 28 miles to the east. Improved roads seemed to favor this plan, and the businessmen of Walla Walla were reported to be enthusiastic about it. According to Captain Nelson several thousand dollars would soon be spent to complete the cabins and make Nespelem into a freight and passenger vessel. By late April, operation of Nespelem had been curtailed to extend no further east from Portland than The Dalles. Nespelem was scheduled to leave on its first trip on this route at 7:00a.m. on April 29, 1919 from the Taylor Street dock in Portland. The plan was to make this run three times weekly. Business however was not sufficient to support making the run in conjunction with Tahoma, which remained tied up in Portland. Business however apparently did not prosper. On May 21, 1919, Tahoma was sold at public auction to satisfy the claims of creditors. By June 8, 1919, Nespelem was itself out of service and tied up at the dock. In July 1919 Nespelem began a trip up the Willamette River from Portland to Albany, Oregon that took 52 days to complete. Nespelem towed two large scows which were to be used in repairing the bridge across the Willamette River at Albany. Miller Navigation Co., still the owners of Nespelem, had chartered the steamer to the Portland Bridge & Building Company for the trip. V.E. Duncan, manager of Miller Navigation Co., went along and aided in solving some of the engineering problems that were encountered. Capt. Clyde Raabe served as master of the Nespelem, and Capt. Charles Nelson as first officer. Although the steamer generally required 2.5 feet of water to float in, there were several swift-moving places in the river where the water was only 18 inches deep. During the trip, Nespelem and the towed barges often had to wait for days while the government dredge Mathloma dug out a channel deep enough to proceed. In other places lining had to be employed to clear shallow areas. The return trip downriver from Albany to Portland took Nespelem only 48 hours, with the steamer arriving in Portland on September 14, 1919, having sustained only minor damage to its paddle wheel and loss of part of its rudder. On November 14, 1919, two members of the crew of Nespelem, Robert Stevenson and Ed Collins, were arrested by federal authorities and held for investigation. Nespelem was then running on the route between Portland and Oregon City, Oregon. Stevenson and Collins were said to have disobeyed orders of the master of Nespelem, and were suspected of being members of the Industrial Workers of the World, generally referred to at the time by its initials, I.W.W. At the same time, three I.W.W. organizers were arrested and sentenced in Portland Municipal court, before Judge Rossman on charges of vagrancy. Federal authorities were also involved in these arrests. These events occurred only a few days after a violent incident in Centralia, Washington known as the Centralia Massacre, involving the I.W.W. and members of the American Legion. In February 1920, Western Transportation Co. took Nespelem out of service at their Washington street dock in Portland, on the Willamette River for a general overhaul and for conversion to an oil-burner. As the overhaul neared completion, the officers of the Crown Willamette Paper Company decided to rename Nespelem as Robert Young, to honor Capt. Robert J. Young (ca. 1864- Nov. 1, 1921), the long-term manager of Western Transportation Company. As of March 4, 1920, Robert Young was expected to be placed back in service within a week. Along with the other six steamers of the Western Transportation fleet, Robert Young would be used to provide general towing and lighterage service to the Crown Willamette paper mills at Oregon City, Oregon and Camas, Washington. In early March 1920, the owners announced who would be the officers of the Robert Young. These were: T.A. Lowery, master; Chris Bluhm, pilot; Herbert Fiddler, mate; Clarence Dillon, chief engineer; and George Toedermeier, assistant engineer. On the night of November 13, 1921, Robert Young was damaged by a collision with a naval reserve patrol vessel, Eagle Boat No. 38. Robert Young was moored at the dock at the foot of Washington Street in Portland, Oregon, when Eagle Boat No. 38 approached the Morrison Bridge and signaled for the draw to open. However the patrol craft, manned by reservists, was proceeding too fast to allow the draw to be opened, and to avoid colliding with the bridge, veered off to the side, where it impacted Robert Young, cutting through the heavy oak protective timber along the outside of the tope of the hull, called a guard, and into the sternwheeler’s hull itself. On November 5, 1925, an 18-year-old man, Teddy Farrance, fell off a barge into the Columbia river and was drowned. According to the parents of the drowned man, the death was caused by tangled life-lines on board the Robert Young. They brought a legal action seeking damages of $25,000 from Western Transportation Co. for the death of their son. The case eventually went to trial before a jury on March 12, 1929, before Judge Campbell in the Multnomah County Circuit Court. Farrange had been an employee on Robert Young. After trial began, on March 13, 1929, the lawsuit against Western Transportation Company by Farange’s parents was settled, with the company confessing judgment for $750. On October 23, 1928, at Dobelbower Crossing (on the Columbia River between Longview and Kalama, Washington), there was a collision between the Robert Young and the ocean-going steamer Ernest H. Meyer. As a result, the license of Captain C.A. Becktell, master of the Robert Young, was suspended for 10 days by the inspectors of the U.S. steamboat inspection service. In January 1930, with Captain Becktell in command, Robert Young became trapped in river ice in the Willamette River downriver from Jennings Lodge, Oregon, near Oregon City. Other steamers of the Western Transportation Company were also trapped in the ice at the same time, at different locations on the Willamette and Columbia rivers. Robert Young was still trapped in the ice on January 21, 1930. On January 22, 1930, crews from the Western Transportation Company tried using blasting powder to free Robert Young from the ice, so that the vessel could be used to aid another of the company’s sternwheelers, Claire, which was also trapped in the ice, at Oregon City. Robert Young continued to be frozen in the ice through January 23. The ice finally broke up, and freed Robert Young, on the night of Thursday, January 30, 1930. Some temporary repairs were made in Portland, and Robert Young was back in service by 4:30p.m. on Saturday afternoon, February 1, 1930. Permanent repairs were made the next week at the Portland Shipbuilding Company. In November 1935, Robert Young struck a submerged log and sank in the Willamette River near Oswego. The crew were able to beach the vessel before it sank in six feet of water. Western Transportation Company, owner of the Robert Young, announced that they intended to raise the vessel on the night of November 8, 1935 and return it to Portland for repairs. The log struck by the Robert Young was said to have been a hemlock sinker, which stood almost on end in 40 feet of water, with the upper end coming to about three feet from the surface of the water. In December 1935, Robert Young was rebuilt into a floating machine shop at the Oceanic terminal in Portland. The sternwheel and the boiler was removed. The unpowered Robert Young was reported to have been abandoned in 1937.",Normal

"Arthur Goldreich (25 December 1929 – 24 May 2011) was a South African-Israeli abstract painter and a key figure in the anti-apartheid movement in the country of his birth and a critic of the form of Zionism practiced in Israel. Goldreich was born in Pietersburg, South Africa, and settled in Palestine, where he participated in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war as a member of the Palmach, the elite military wing of the Haganah. In time he became a leading figure at Bezalel Academy in Jerusalem. In 1966, he became the head of Industrial and Environmental Design Department, which he helped transform into an internationally recognized center for design. By the age of 33, Goldreich had moved back to South Africa where he became one of the country's most successful artists. In 1955, he won South Africa's Best Young Painter Award for his figures in black and white, but to the Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd's government, he was a key suspect in the clandestine operations of the anti-apartheid underground. Goldreich and Harold Wolpe, a lawyer, used South African Communist Party funds to buy Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia for use as a secret meeting place by leaders of the banned African National Congress (ANC) and its armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe. Goldreich and Wolpe also helped locate sabotage sites for Umkhonto we Sizwe, the military arm of the ANC, and draft a disciplinary code for guerrillas. In 1963, Liliesleaf Farm was raided by the police, leading to the arrest of most of the ANC leadership, including Goldreich. Wolpe was arrested shortly after the raid and was held with Goldreich at Marshall Square prison in the city. The two met up with Moosa Moolla and Abdulhay Jassat, members of the Natal Indian Congress, allied to the African National Congress. Moola and Jassat had been held in solitary confinement, where they had been tortured (they were believed to be the first political activists tortured in South African jails). Eventually the four men, working together with the aid of a prison warden, escaped successfully from custody, splitting up outside the prison (with Goldreich disguised as a priest). Wolpe and Goldreich spent several days hiding in and around Johannesburg's suburbs to avoid capture. Eventually, they were driven to Swaziland, and from there were flown to Botswana, still disguised as priests to avoid being identified by potentially pro-South African British colonial authorities (at this time Swaziland was not independent). According to The Guardian, by February 2006, Goldreich was living in the city of Herzliya. ""There was a time when he believed the young Jewish state might provide the example of a better way for the country of his birth. As it is, Goldreich sees Israel as closer to the white regime he fought against and modern South Africa as providing the model. Israeli governments, he says, ultimately proved more interested in territory than peace, and along the way Zionism mutated. Goldreich speaks of the 'bantustanism we see through a policy of occupation and separation', the 'abhorrent' racism in Israeli society all the way up to cabinet ministers who advocate the forced removal of Arabs, and 'the brutality and inhumanity of what is imposed on the people of the occupied territories of Palestine'. 'Don't you find it horrendous that this people and this state, which only came into existence because of the defeat of fascism and Nazism in Europe, and in the conflict six million Jews paid with their lives for no other reason than that they were Jews, is it not abhorrent that in this place there are people who can say these things and do these things?' he asks.",Normal

"Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a noninvasive imaging method that provides spectroscopic information in addition to the image that is generated by MRI alone. Whereas traditional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) generates a black-and-white image in which brightness is determined primarily by the T1 or T2 relaxation times of the tissue being imaged, the spectroscopic information obtained in an MRSI study can be used to infer further information about cellular activity (metabolic information). For example, in the context of oncology, an MRI scan may reveal the shape and size of a tumor, while an MRSI study provides additional information about the metabolic activity occurring in the tumor. MRSI can be performed on a standard MRI scanner, and the patient experience is the same for MRSI as for MRI. MRSI has broad applications in medicine, including oncology and general physiological studies. When hydrogen is the target element, MRSI is also called 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. MRSI can also be performed with phosphorus, or hyperpolarized carbon-13. This article incorporates public domain material from Dictionary of Cancer Terms. U.S. National Cancer Institute.

"Arsal (also spelled Aarsal, Ersal or 'Irsal; Arabic: عرسال), is a town and municipality situated east of Labweh, 124 kilometres (77mi) northeast of Beirut, in Baalbek District of Baalbek-Hermel Governorate, Lebanon. The population is predominantly Sunni Muslim. It is a traditional town situated on the slopes of the Anti-Lebanon mountains. It is known for its local hand-made carpet industry. The area is known to be one of the few places in the Anti-Lebanon with a good water supply. The Lebanese Ministry of Tourism brochure suggests that the name Arsal or Ersal means ""God's Throne"" in Aramaic. It documents several rock-cut benches (mastabas) in the village, numerous historical monuments in the nearby hills and an ancient fortified structure in the nearby Wadi Al-Toun of unknown date. Ain Choaab or Ain Chaub spring is located in the nearby hills, just of the main road from Arsal to Labweh. There are Natufian rock shelters situated 80 metres (260ft) above the wadi bed of the spring that can be accessed via a steep climb up a ridge. Flint tools were collected from the site by Bruce Schroeder in 1970. The Ain Choaab archaeological site has not yet been excavated. In 1838, Eli Smith noted 'Arsal as a Metawileh village in the Baalbek area. On 17 September 2012, Syrian ground-attack aircraft fired three missiles 500 metres (1,600ft) over the border into Lebanese territory near Arsal. It was suggested that the jets were chasing rebels in the vicinity. The attack prompted Lebanese president Michel Sleiman to launch an investigation, whilst not publicly blaming Syria for the incident. On 22 September 2012, a group of armed members of the Free Syrian Army attacked a border post near Arsal. This was reported to be the second incursion within a week. The group were chased off into the hills by the Lebanese Army, who detained and later released some rebels due to pressure from locals. Michel Sleiman praised the actions taken by the military as maintaining Lebanon's position being ""neutral from the conflicts of others"". He called on border residents to ""stand beside their army and assist its members."" Syria has repeatedly called for an intensified crackdown on rebels that it claims are hiding in Lebanese border towns. One thousand four hundred refugee children from the Syrian civil war have been displaced into the town, where schools only have places for one hundred students. The situation reflects a growing crisis threatening to overwhelm the Beqaa educational system. On 2 February 2013, the Lebanese army was the victim of an armed ambush in the town as it was seeking to arrest Khaled Homayed. Two army officers were killed and a number of soldiers were wounded. Homayed is believed to have been involved with the Fatah al-Islam organization that was responsible for many deadly attacks on the Lebanese army as well as the kidnapping of seven Estonians in 2011. He is also believed to be active with the Free Syrian Army. Town residents refused to cooperate with the army to reveal the whereabouts of the gunmen who were responsible for the ambush. In August 2014, ISIS and its allies launched a full-scale invasion and the battle with Lebanese troops went on for five days before they were forced back into Syria. In January 2016 a local newspaper reported that there were 10,000 Syrian refugees in Arsal itself with a further 100,000 in dozens of camps around the town. A second report estimated that Arsal was host to 50,000 refugees. On 21 July 2017, a Syrian Army commander stated that his forces and Hezbollah had launched a joint campaign to recapture the remaining territory under militant control near the Lebanon-Syria border, attacking the outskirts of Arsal. The Lebanese Army meanwhile assumed a defensive position in Arsal. In 2019, the Lebanese central government decided to demolish the refuges' huts built of hollow blocks over the war years on the grounds of missing building permits. According to the UNHCR, the resolution affects about 2,300 shelters in 17 camps around Arsal and up to 15,000 people, of whom about half are children.

"Joseph ""Joe"" Bernal (born March 1, 1927) is an American politician. He was a significant figure in the Chicano community. Bernal spent eight years in the Texas Legislature. Bernal was in both the Texas House of Representatives and the Texas Senate. Bernal was in the Texas House of Representatives from 1964 to 1966, He was in the Texas Senate from 1966 to 1972. When Bernal got his start in politics 80% of Chicanos were not graduating high school. Now only 30% are not graduating which he says is still a high percentage. During his time in politics, Bernal produced many opportunities for schooling and opportunities for the Chicano community as a whole. The impact that Bernal had on his community got San Antonio school district superintendent Oscar Miller to meet with community sponsors such as Senator Bernal and others to address Chicanoa student's demands for improved school facilities. Joseph ""Joe"" Bernal was born March 1, 1927, in San Antonio, Texas. Bernal said that his family grew up poor, he did not think that they were poor because they did not act like they were. In a statement from Bernal, he said that his family ""was very rich in spirit"" and his mom raised nine kids by herself. Bernal's father had passed away when he was young.Bernal enjoyed watching movies at the Progreso, often standing near the entrance during ""dos por uno"" promotions. He enjoyed popular Hollywood movies on weekends. His family frequented the Progreso Drug Store and the Mexican restaurant next door. Bernal was a student council representative at Lanier High School. This was his first step towards politics. Bernal also played basketball at Lanier High School where his team made the state finals but lost by one point. Bernal said that the students in his high school were given ribbons that read ""I am American, I speak English"" and had them taken away by the student council when someone was caught speaking Spanish. However, Bernal encouraged people to be bilingual. After high school in 1944, Bernal joined the army. In the army, Bernal was never in combat but he worked a desk job in the Philippine islands of Leyte, Mindoro, Luzon, and as well as in Tokyo, Japan. While working his desk job on deployment he would constantly look at his picture from September 1, 1945, when he was nine days from being deployed and he thought that before he deployed people just looked at him as a Mexican but in the service, he was looked at as an American. When he returned, he found that things had reverted to the way they were before his military service, with instances where he couldn't get a haircut or buy a house due to his Mexican heritage. After Bernal returned he attended Trinity University on the G.I. Bill. He also got his master's degree from Our Lady of the Lake University and a doctorate degree from the University of Texas at Austin. Bernal taught at David Crockett Elementary School for ten years, while he did that on the weekends and in his free time he worked with Guadalupe Church and had a long association with Inman Christian Center. The Chicano Movement's purpose was to fight for the civil rights and cultural identities of the Chicano and Mexican-American Communities. The movement was most active in the 1960s and 1970s but still continues today. Today Chicanos and Latinos make up the largest minority in the United States being about 20% of the population. The term Chicano became popular around the 1940s. The term Chicano was used by second-generation Mexican-Americans like Zoot-suiters and Pachucos who felt they were outcasts in both the Anglo-American culture and the Mexican culture of their parents. The Chicano Movement helped advance Latino political power. The Chicano Movement was in response to the poverty, discrimination, and lack of opportunity that faced Mexican-American communities. The movement got motivation from the farmworker movement led by Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. The movement fought against segregated public schools in East Los Angeles, leading to the ""Blowouts"" in 1968, resulting in thousands of Chicano students protesting. Joseph ""Joe"" Bernal never thought of being a politician but when brought the idea he saw how underrepresented Chicanos were during that time. His Austin political career was between 1964 and 1972 then he was a part of the Mexican-American Caucus after this. Between 1900 and 1953, Texas had only two Hispanics in the legislature. By 1987, 25 Mexican Americans held legislative offices, largely due to the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project and redistricting. Bernal had a lot to do with bills that helped Mexican-Americans and others. Bernal joined the Texas House of Representatives in 1964. In Joseph's first term, he passed three bills including a bill on segregation. This is also where he passed a bill that allowed people who were in Texas for more than 25 years to receive benefits regardless of citizenship status. Bernal acted as the executive director of the Mexican-American Caucus. During his time in this group, he accomplished many things to further Mexican Americans' rights and their community. Bernal also had a role in getting better education rights for Latino children. In 1967, Dan Salcedo and Joe Bernal, sponsors of the Inman Christian Center, organized a field trip to Center Point, Texas. The group provided information on political issues, organizing strategies, and leadership training to male Lanier students. Senator Bernal mentored female students on American democracy and parliamentary decision-making according to Robert's Rules of Order. Bernal introduced legislation abolishing English-only language laws, established a San Antonio campus for the University of Texas, and supported a new Dental and Nursing Program at the University of Texas San Antonio campus. Tejano politics have been around for more than a century before the formation of the state of Texas in 1845. The oldest tradition of government by Tejanos was ayuntamiento which is traceable all the way back to the Roman time. Ayuntamiento is a form of government that is run by a mayor and a council. The main focus was both civil and criminal matters. This area's first ayuntamiento was not formed until 1731. The economic, social, and political structures of the ayuntamiento form of government were supported by many of the residents like the Ranchos and Spanish Missions. On September 16, 1810, in Dolores, Guanajuato Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla made a cry for Mexico's independence from Spain. When this news was received by the Tejanos many people disagreed because they considered it disloyal. After many royalist officials were executed near Bexar, because of this event the central government of Mexico sent Commandant General Joaquín de Arredondo to take Texas back. In 1813 he succeeded in doing this. Many wealthy Tejano families fled Texas. The Texas Revolution was mainly led by Anglos but many Tejanos participated but were now the minority. ""Among the fifty-six men who signed the Texas Declaration of Independence on March 2, 1836, three were Hispanic"". Many things went into a lack of Tejano political representation for example minority status, disregard of rights, language differences, etc. Tejano's political participation dropped under American rule. ""Between 1846 and 1961 only nineteen Hispanic politicians won election or were named to represent their districts in the state legislature"". Between the 1940s and 1960s, significant national conferences and organizations were established to improve relations between Anglos and Mexican Americans. To help improve relations the US government initiated diplomatic solutions. This included the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and organized two national conferences. Joseph ""Joe"" Bernal played a major role in Tejano politics, especially in bilingual education. The bills that ended in De jure segregation were brought forward in the Texas Senate by Bernal in May 1969. During the early twentieth century, there were many organizations that were found in all of the areas where most of the Tejanos lived. These organizations fought for Mexican-American rights and fought the issues of lynching, labor, and educational discrimination. Representatives of these groups met in Harlingen Texas to form the LLAC (League of Latin American Citizens) in August of 1927. This group did not succeed in its mission, but just two years later in February of 1929, the LULAC (League of United Latin American Citizens) was formed and became the leading national civil rights organization. The Mexican-American Caucus was made up of Mexican-American members of the Texas House of Representatives including Joseph ""Joe"" Bernal. The Mexican-American Legislative Caucus first originated in 1972 but didn't become a caucus until 1975. In 1981 the Mexican-American Legislative Caucus became an official organization with a budget and staff from the Texas House of Representatives. The objective of this group was to promote and fight for legislation that benefits Mexican Americans. In 1975 Bernal was the first executive director of the Mexican-American Legislative Caucus. In 1983, the first Republican, Gerald Gesitweidt, joined MALC. In 1991–92, it had 26 members, representing a fifth of the House vote. In 2001, it had 41 members.This organization that Bernal was a part of helped the Mexican-American community in many ways. Some examples of the ways the Mexican-American Caucus helped would be in 1983–84 they passed a Bilingual Education Act, and in 1985–86 they passed an unemployment-compensation law that also included farmworkers. Another thing that the MALC did was pass a minimum wage bill for farmworkers in 1987–88. This group affected the redistricting process in the years 1991 and in 2001. After his career in politics, Joseph ""Joe"" Bernal became an assistant superintendent for the Harlandale School District. Then in 1996, he was elected to the Board of education. Bernal also won his reelection in the year 2000. Bernal assisted in selecting textbooks and supporting programs that benefited Latino youth during his time as an assistant superintendent and as a member of the Board of education. Bernal is a well-known figure in the Mexican-American community which he still participates in.",Normal
"Kathleen Saintsbury (4 July 1899 – 1995) was a British actress from the 1920s to the 1970s but who is best known today for playing Cissy Godfrey in the BBC comedy Dad's Army. Saintsbury was born in London in 1899, the younger daughter of the actor H.A. Saintsbury (also a playwright under the name Jay Nibb) and his Irish wife, Florence. According to the 1911 census, her parents were married in 1893, but there is no record of a marriage in England. Saintsbury's older sister, Dorothie Helen (known as Helen) was also an actress. Helen married first the actor Edgar Norfolk and, after a divorce, Captain Buckley Rutherford, a son of Sir Ernest Rutherford (a wine importer, not the physicist Ernest Rutherford, although they were both born in 1871 and are sometimes confused). The marriage to Rutherford took place in 1932; four months later Rutherford shot himself. Distraught, less than a month after Rutherford's suicide, Helen also shot herself. There is some suggestion that Helen was married three times, but it is possible this reflects that her first husband was originally called Edgar Greenwood, and changed his name to Norfolk for the stage. Early in her career, Saintsbury appeared in stage productions: Saintsbury's subsequent television work included: Saintsbury is best-known for her appearance in an episode of Dad's Army. Nan Braunton had previously appeared as Cissy Godfrey, one of Private Godfrey's two sisters. Saintsbury appeared in place of Braunton in 1975, in episode 3 of series 8, Is There Honey Still for Tea? Saintsbury died in 1995, aged 95. She was unmarried.",Normal
"Forked Run State Park is a public recreation area located three miles (4.8km) south of Reedsville in eastern Meigs County, Ohio, United States. The state park's area is 791 acres (320ha), while the lake covers 102 acres (41ha). The name is pronounced with two syllables for ""Fork-ed"". It fronts on Ohio State Route 124. The park borders the Shade River State Forest, from which it was created in 1951. The dam was created in 1952, when the park was opened to the public. Park features include campground, rustic cabins, picnic facilities, hiking trails, swimming beach, boat ramps, and disc golf course. It also is located close to an Ohio River boat ramp, so the campground also serves Ohio River boaters.",Normal

"French victory The Anglo-French War of 1557–1559 was part of the Italian War of 1551–1559. Following the French defeat at the Battle of St. Quentin (1557) England entered the war. The French laid Siege to Calais in response. Following failure in mid-1557, a renewed attack captured the outlying forts of Nieullay and Rysbank and Calais was besieged. On 1 January 1558, the French vanguard invested Sangatte and Fréthun Nielles, and the Army Corps reduced Fort Risban the next day. On 3 January, the artillery moved into Fort Nieulay at Rysbank. Thomas, Lord Wentworth, completely overwhelmed by a lightning attack, handed the keys of the city to the French on 7 January. The booty taken by the French was more than they had hoped for: food for three months and nearly 300 guns. The English defences of Guînes and Hames soon also fell. Henry II of France arrived at Calais on 23 January 1558. France had reconquered the last territory it had lost in the Hundred Years' War and put an end to two centuries of fighting between England and France. The new French administration made a particularly efficient demarcation of the border, created a new division of farmland, reorganized the 24 parishes, and reconstructed villages and churches. No harm came to the English residents: after a rather uncomfortable night they were escorted to the waiting boats and given safe passage across the English Channel. In England there was shock and disbelief at the loss of this final Continental territory. The story goes that a few months later Queen Mary, on her death bed, told her ladies: ""When I am dead and cut open, they will find Philip and Calais inscribed on my heart."" The Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis (1559) confirmed that the French would retain their conquest of the Pale of Calais.",Normal
"Hypertension is a condition characterized by an elevated blood pressure in which the long term consequences include cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, adrenal gland tumors, vision impairment, memory loss, metabolic syndrome, stroke and dementia. It affects nearly 1 in 2 Americans and remains as a contributing cause of death in the United States. There are many genetic and environmental factors involved with the development of hypertension including genetics, diet, and stress. The brain is one of the major organs affected by hypertension and recent findings have linked hypertension to various forms of cognitive decline. Not only does hypertension affect the cellular structure and molecular composition of blood vessels (arteries, veins, capillaries), it also affects their ability to regulate vital functions that are essential for healthy brain function such as oxygen and glucose delivery, cerebral environment control via the blood-brain barrier, and trafficking of immune cells and metabolic by-products. These hypertension-induced effects eventually lead to white matter lesions, which is the pathological basis for hypertension-induced cognitive impairment. A National Institute on Aging (NIA) study that measured cognition twenty years after measuring blood pressure showed that there was a 9% increase in risk for cognitive decline for every 10mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure. Additionally, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cognitive study shows that those with prehypertension or high blood pressure performed lower on processing speed, short-term memory, and executive function tests. Hypertension is also a prominent risk factor for two major brain diseases: stroke and dementia, and accounts for approximately 50% of deaths caused by stroke or heart disease according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Primary hypertension, also known as essential hypertension, is the result of a consistent elevation of the force of blood being pumped throughout the body, whereas secondary hypertension is the result of high blood pressure due to another medical condition.> Diseases that can cause secondary hypertension include diabetic nephropathy, glomerular disease, polycystic kidney disease, cushing syndrome, pheochromocytoma, aldosteronism, sleep apnea, obesity, and pregnancy. Most often, there are no definite symptoms to this disease. There are some signs that one could look for to deduce it is secondary hypertension rather than primary such as sudden onset of hypertension before the age of 30 or after 55, no family history of hypertension, hypertension that does not respond to medication (resistant hypertension), and no signs of obesity. In terms of environmental factors, dietary salt intake is the leading risk factor in the development of hypertension. Salt sensitivity is characterized by an increase in blood pressure with an increase in dietary salt and is associated with various genetic, demographic, and physiological factors— African American populations, postmenopausal women, and older individuals carry a higher risk of developing salt sensitivity. In normal conditions, the body counteracts excessive salt intake by increasing cardiac output and expanding extracellular fluid volume. However, individuals who are salt-sensitive exhibit an over reactive sympathetic nervous system and are unable to suppress the renin-angiotensin axis as well as normotensive individuals, resulting in salt retention by the kidneys and increased vascular resistance and consequently, increased risk of developing hypertension. Furthermore, it is estimated that 51% of people that are hypertensive are salt sensitive compared to 26% of people that are normotensive. Salt sensitivity is often associated with endothelial dysfunction due to reduced nitric oxide (NO) production and endothelial NO synthase activity, which impairs vasodilation. During sodium intake, an increased production of NO in the kidneys and peripheral vasculature is imperative for sodium balance and regulation of blood pressure. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) regulates blood pressure, fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, and vascular resistance via release of hormones. The system is initiated by renin converting the precursor protein angiotensinogen into angiotensin I (Ang I). Ang I then gets converted to Ang II by the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) which then goes on to produce a number of different effects on the body. One such effect is inducing hypertension via Ang II and Ang metabolites produced by the degradation of Ang I and Ang II. Ang II increases blood pressure by constricting blood vessels and it stimulates the production of aldosterone, which also increases blood pressure by increasing the volume of fluid in the body via increased sodium reabsorption by renal tubules in the kidney. Hypertension is associated with enhanced RAAS activity. There are several Ang receptors in the body with the most common being AT1R, which is expressed in the heart, kidney, gut, blood vessels, and the brain. Ang II binds AT1R to produce vasoconstriction, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Activation of AT2R has opposite effects of those to AT1R, exerting hypotensive effects. The endothelium plays a critical role in regulating blood vessels throughout the body, modulating the function of cells with the vessel walls and even non-vascular cells. For example, the endothelium releases cytokines and expresses adhesion molecules that recruit leukocytes, which is important in inflammation. The endothelium influences vascular muscle by regulating vascular tone and it also determines vascular permeability into the tissues— tight junctions between endothelial cells are pertinent in the blood brain barrier. The endothelium secretes vasoconstrictive and vasodilative molecules that play a major role in controlling vascular tone and blood flow. Nitric oxide (NO) and prastacyclin are the main vasodilatory molecules and an impairment or reduction of the molecules activity andor production is the main cause of endothelial dysfunction. In models of Ang II-dependent hypertension, endothelium-dependent vasodilation is reduced. Dysfunction of ion channels is also associated with impaired endothelial function. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart to other areas of the body. They are mainly responsible for transporting oxygen and nutrients to various parts of the body and removing carbon dioxide and wastes. Arteries are generally elastic, which allows them to bend and fit throughout the body and maintain a stable blood pressure. Arterial stiffness occurs as people age and increases the risk of stroke and cardiovascular diseases. Elastin and collagen are of the major determinants of arterial stiffness as well as matrix metalloproteases, advanced glycation endproducts (AGE), inflammation, neuroendocrine signaling, and genetics. The more stiff arteries are, the more pressure the heart needs to exert to pump blood throughout the body and therefore, the higher blood pressure a person has. The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is essential in maintaining a homeostatic environment for neurons and glial cells by preventing solutes from diffusing into the brain interstitial space. The endothelial cells that makeup the BBB are different from those that make up the vasculature structurally, molecularly, and metabolically. They are connected by tight junctions, which further ensure that molecules do not freely pass through. BBB disruption is associated with hypertension, cerebrovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and aging. Inflammation can impair vascular function and therefore cause many of the pathophysiologies mentioned above. Hypertension is accompanied by peripheral inflammation, which can affect CNS function through activation of circumventricular organs (CVOs). Furthermore, Ang II also plays a role in the neural control of blood pressure through the activation of these CVOs. More recently, hypertension is recognized as an immune condition. Chronic inflammation, compromises the BBB, which in turn allows for molecules to leak into the CNS. This then activates astrocytes and microglia, causing an immune response within the brain. Neuroinflammation can reach regulatory centers of blood pressure such as the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), leading to enhanced sympathoexcitation, and ultimately to a sustained elevation of blood pressure. The most common neuroinflammatory markers are interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Hypertension, mainly through Ang II, remodels vessel structure and function by increasing oxidative stress, vascular inflammation, and altering cerebral blood flow. Hypertension causes a reduction in the lumen diameter of cerebral arteries, which increases its vascular resistance. The brain receives around 15–20% of the total cardiac output and therefore, disruptions in this cerebral perfusion have damaging effects to proper neuronal function. Hypertension is the leading cause of strokes and studies show that it increases the risk of a stroke by 220% and stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability. High blood pressure weakens arteries (small vessel disease) and causes blood vessels to be more likely to clog andor burst. A lacunar infarction occurs when an artery is blocked and an intracerebral hemorrhage occurs when the blood vessels burst. In turn, the brain is more vulnerable to ischemic insults as there is a dysregulation in the supply of blood and oxygen. More specifically, hypertension inflicts damage to small resistance arteries, which supply nutrients to the internal capsule, brainstem, thalamus, cerebellum, and basal ganglia, and cause cell death and tissue degeneration. Blood clots also accelerate arterioscelerosis, which causes arteries to thicken and harden. Essentially, hypertension is the biggest risk factor for stroke and tissue damage caused by a stroke is a major risk factor for cognitive decline, therefore the risk of stroke may act as a mediator in the relationship between blood pressure and cognition. Besides lifestyle modifications, blood pressure control is the #1 treatment for stroke prevention. Antihypertensive medication show a protective effect against stroke-related cognitive impairments. Hypertension→ Small vessel disease → Lacunar infarction & Intracerebral hemorrhage → Tissue damage Vascular dementia develops as blood vessels in the brain become damaged, preventing brain cells from receiving the nutrients it needs to function. Hypertension alters the brain's vasculature via inadequate blood flow, leading to changes in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and cerebral blood flow and ultimately, weakening brain structures and functions. Vascular dementia is characterized by ischemic infarcts, cerebral hemorrhages, white matter lesions, BBB dysfunction, andor microvascular degeneration. Multiple longitudinal and cross-sectional studies showed that hypertension is a prevalent risk factor of vascular dementia in participants ranging from 58~90 years old. Moreover, a meta-analysis on the longitudinal and cross-sectional studies showed that hypertensives are 59% more likely to develop vascular dementia compared to those that are normotensive. Although there are no direct correlations with hypertension and its association with Alzheimer's disease, chronic hypertension is associated with white matter lesions, lacunar infarcts, neurotic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, all pathological features of AD. A 1993 Framingham study showed that untreated blood pressure is inversely related to cognitive function in stroke-free adults aged 55–88. Furthermore, a longitudinal clinical trial study paired with secondary data analysis from the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) interventional trial revealed that hypertensives had a faster decrease in frontally-mediated cognitive functions such as reasoning abilities. Many studies show correlations with hypertension and cognitive decline however, some studies do not such as the Chicago Health and Aging Project, which states that blood pressure is not associated with cognitive function. Multiple studies suggest that hypertension is a prevailing factor in the development and progression of age-related cognitive decline and that antihypertensive approaches could help control or relieve the impact of hypertension on cognition. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies from 1970 to 2012 showed that lowering blood pressure via antihypertensive medications is associated with a reduction in heart failure and stroke risk. Additionally, an Epidemiology of Vascular Aging (EVA) study showed that participants with high blood pressure exhibited 4 points lower on the Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) which correlates to these participants being 4.3 times more likely to exhibit cognitive decline and that the risk decreased to 1.9 times in those taking antihypertensive medication. However, it is still up to debate on whether antihypertensive medications have an impact on cognitive decline. A randomized double blind study by the Systolic Hypertension Study in Europe revealed that the incidence of dementia was lowered by 50% in participants that were given pharmacological intervention for hypertension after 2 years and that there was a 55% decrease in the individuals developing Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. The pharmacological drugs included nitrendipine (calcium-channel blocker), enalapril (ACE inhibitor), and hydrochlorothiazide (diuretic). Various studies looking at different classes of antihypertensive medication including ARBs, beta-blockers, diuretics, and ACE inhibitors, reveal that pharmacological treatments have overall cerebroprotective effects however, the effects vary depending on drug class and its mechanisms. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors essentially block the conversion of Ang I to Ang II. They cause relaxation of the blood vessels as there are less Ang II molecules (vasoconstrictor) circulating, increase natriuresis, decrease blood volume, all of which culminate in lowering blood pressure. Enalapril, Benazepril, Perindopril, and Ramipril are among commonly prescribed ACE inhibitors clinically. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) antagonize the action of Ang II by binding and inhibiting angiotensin II type 1 receptor. In doing so, ARBs block vasoconstriction, promote natriuresis, and reduce oxidative stress. Studies show that the vasodilator ability of vessels are impaired in hypertensives which causes brain perfusion to decrease significantly, influencing cognitive function. ACEs and ARBs improve cerebral perfusion in hypertensive patients. Losartan, Irbesartan, Valsartan, Olmesartan, and Azilsartan, are common ARBs that are clinically available. AT2R agonists cause vasodilation, exerting hypotensive effects. In animal models of ischemia, activation of AT2R is protective as it reduces the infarct area by increasing cerebral perfusion, decreases superoxide production, and promotes neuronal cell differentiation and neuritis growth, which all come together to reduce axonal degeneration and inflammation. Beta-blockers are competitive antagonists of the adrenergic beta receptor, blocking the binding sites of epinephrine and norepinephrine. They lower blood pressure by a RAAS independent mechanism, reducing plasma renin activity and Ang II levels. Propranolol, Atenolol, Bupranolol, Timolol, are some examples of clinically available beta-blockers.",Normal

"Grandi magazzini (transl. Department Store) is a 1986 Italian anthology comedy film directed by Castellano & Pipolo. Various characters and stories intertwine inside the Grandi Magazzini store. Evaristo Mazzetti is a cleaner at the department store. As a favour to his friend De Rossi, he agrees to replace him as a clerk in the sanitary department, not knowing that the man owes 30 million Italian lira to a loan shark named Puccio and that De Rossi is actually the son of the engineer Gruber, owner of the G.M. During the day, Evaristo is visited several times by the debt collector sent by Puccio to collect the debt: at each appearance, he causes several bone fractures. As chance would have it, Helena, wife of Dr Umberto Anzellotti, head of personnel, has discovered that Gruber's son is working under a false name as a clerk in the sanitary department. Having revealed this to her husband, the woman leads him to believe that this son is Mazzetti himself; so between an invitation to lunch and an attempt at seduction by the woman, a meeting with Evaristo's father is arranged. The surprise arrival of the engineer Gruber leads to other misunderstandings that cause Evaristo's dismissal, until he is reinstated by De Rossi himself, who in the meantime has paid off his gambling debt. The manager of the G.M., despotic and always and only focused on his work, after having treated his secretary, Miss Romano, coldly all day long, mends his ways at the end of the day by inviting her first to dinner and then to his house. Corrado Minozzi is a security guard at the department store. Called to order by the manager for negligence, he promises not to let more than one thief get away, but in the course of the day he first has a bicycle stolen from under his eyes by a shoplifter, then a radio, a woman's dress and finally lets a couple get away who never buy anything but steal the trolleys. Fausto Valsecchi is a home delivery man at a department store. During the day, harassed by the shipping manager, he finds himself involved in various situations: a doorman won't let him use the lift to transport a television set, a Great Dane ends up attacking him, an inconsolable widow wants to keep him for lunch and a quarrelsome couple involve him in an argument. At the end of the day he accepts the offer of a homosexual engineer, to whom he has made his last delivery, to take the place of his partner Mimì who has abandoned him, taking revenge on his shipping manager. Nicola Abatecola is a beggar with a false leg who, together with his daughter Assunta, works as a street musician at the entrance to the department store. Despite his situation, Nicola does not feel sorry for himself, but rather smiles at life, selling what he defines as a rare commodity, cheerfulness, to the customers of the department store, and he even manages to obtain a generous donation from the manager. Marco Salviati is an actor on his twilight years, an alcoholic and in financial difficulty. He accepts his agent Simoni's offer to shoot a commercial for the department store for a million lire salary. During filming, Salviati continually tries to drink alcohol on the sly, until he gets drunk on champagne in the meeting room. Brought back to the set by production secretary Bonanni, he angers the director by constantly changing his lines. In order to save his friend's face, Simoni obtains to let him shoot the commercial without film, promising the director to find a free substitute; Salviati this time plays the commercial perfectly, but when he is asked to shoot another one for safety he refuses, then making the noble gesture of offering champagne to the crew with his pay. Antonio Borazzi is a lout from Cantalupo in Sabina, the lucky winner of a shopping voucher to spend at the G.M., to the tune of 500,000 Italian lira. He entrusts his choice of goods to Miss Carla Marchi and after spending the whole day in the supermarkets, unable to find any goods to spend the precise amount he has won, he finally opts for a night with the attractive saleswoman. Turati and Nardini are two prisoners convicted of fraud who, having just been released from prison, try to pull off a scam against the GMs, passing off one of them as a German-made humanoid robot that they would like to sell to the purchasing manager, Dr. Tucci. Tucci, however, decides to have the article examined by an expert in marketing for children, his son Carletto, who subjects Turati to a series of painful tests. Roberto, a G.M. salesman, is madly in love with Ornella Muti, to whom he writes every day. Surprisingly, the actress herself appears at the G.M.'s to meet him and to convince him that the right woman for him is his ex-girlfriend Luisa. Shortly afterwards, Roberto realises he has been dreaming, but decides to follow Muti's advice anyway and returns with Luisa, who happens to look exactly like the well-known actress. A very short-sighted customer loses her contact lenses and gets lost in the G.M.; after a thousand vicissitudes she finally believes she has made it home, but in reality the bedroom she is in is in the furniture department. There are also other stories and sketches. A voyeur pays a boilermaker to see up the skirts of customers entering the shop through a grille, even making him raise his skirt like Marilyn Monroe in the movie The Seven Year Itch. A mannequin dresser mistakes a real woman for a mannequin and leaves her shirtless. A saleswoman in the cosmetics department tries on lipstick on her hand to show it to a customer, who leaves without buying anything. In the end it turns out that the saleswoman tested the lipsticks on an artificial hand. A customer tries out a Japanese voice-controlled car and ends up telling her off for talking too much. The car responds in kind. A customer interviewed for an advertisement for Push detergent complains that her white blouse was blue before she washed it. A customer with stings on his face asks for an insecticide against wasps and a salesman shows him one that makes a scooter of the same name crash to the ground. A black customer asks the reception desk where the 'white fair' is (the post-Christmas sales on underwear, a great classic of the period). A lady takes a packet of condoms, saying that this will enable her daughter's boyfriend to give her a proof of love. The daughter, very ugly, turns around and tells her mother that she doesn't have a boyfriend. In the integral version there is also a parody of the Motta Tartufone commercial, widely broadcast in those years, this time using the precious vegetable; again in the integral version, a shop assistant tests the functioning of some products, among which a hair dryer and a dildo. A customer wants to buy a reversed sheepskin jacket and the salesman presents him with a live sheep. In the uncut version of the film other customers ask for similar clothes and the salesman shows them all the same sheep. When a customer asks for a sheep, he says he doesn't have any more. The film was one of the most popular Italian films for the year with over 1.9 million admissions.",Normal

"Mount Lehman or Mt. Lehman (49°07'00""N, 122°23'00""W) is a small rural community located in the Fraser Valley of south western British Columbia, Canada. The community was established in 1874 and became part of the District of Matsqui in 1892. The District of Matsqui was incorporated into the present day City of Abbotsford, British Columbia in 1995. Mount Lehman is situated on an area of upraised land (hence, where the ""Mount"" comes into the name), that lies between the flat plains of Matsqui Prairie to the east and Glen Valley to the west. The original historic community can be roughly bounded by the Fraser River in the north, Harris Road in the South, Bradner Road in the West, and Matsqui Prairie in the east. Mount Lehman is named for Isaac Lehman. In 1875, first cousins Samuel and Isaac Lehman pre-empted many acres of land in the area. In 1874 the area consisted of a heavily wooded plateau of massive cedar and fir trees, sandwiched between two fertile plains just south of the Fraser River. This hardly seemed a likely place for a burgeoning farming community. However, in April that same year, Royal Engineer Alben Hawkins arrived to survey the area and took up residence on the escarpment overlooking the Matsqui Prairie. He became the fourth Anglo-Caucasian to settle on the upraised land that separated Glen Valley and the Matsqui municipality. Charles Malcolm Nicholson and his wife Priscilla and their eight children were already settled there since about 1872, about 1 kilometer to the S.E of Hawkins. However, Nicholson was not a landowner. Two years later, cousins Sam and Isaac Lehman arrived. Isaac Lehman, and his brother in law, Christian Musselman who were the second pair to be granted pre-emption lands on the escarpment close to Hawkins plot. Christian Musselman's land was directly west of Alben Hawkins while Isaac Lehman's 14 section was some distance closer to the Fraser River, located at the NE corner of section 11 township 14. Christian died un expectantly and Isaac's cousin Samuel, his wife Katherine and their six children arrived to take up Christian Musselman's pre-empted lands. These pioneers of the 1870s established the small community that would eventually bear the family name. Of note is that two other families arrived and settled the N.W. side of the Mount Lehman escarpment prior to 1868. Moses Graff and A. Patterson settled at the far east end of the Glenn Valley. Fort Langley, the HBC outpost, was located at the far western portion of Glenn Valley and it was established in the late 1820s. A wharf was soon built on the Fraser River at the spot at foot of the bluff and this became known as Lehman's Landing. The landing became an important riverboat stop east of Fort Langley. At the time it was the only entry point into the Matsqui area and was served by paddle-wheel steam boats that travelled up and down the Fraser River between Yale and New Westminster. Lehman and other settlers took on the huge task of logging the area, clearing the dense coastal underbrush and building a network of trails. One of those trails, leading from the wharf to the farming settlement, was called Landing Road. Landing Road was open for vehicular traffic until 1950, and while some of the road remains, the last few hundred metres of the route to the river landing is now just a walking trail. Pilings in the river still remain to mark where the wharf once stood. Mount Lehman was an attractive location for newcomers, as it was safe from the Fraser's summer floods and plagues of mosquitoes. Once cleared, the forest floor yielded rich farming and pasture lands. People came to settle and by 1883, Thomson's General Store operated at Lehman's Landing. The Mount Lehman Post Office began operation May 1, 1884. The first one-room school was also built in 1884 near the site of the current school. It was replaced by a two-room building sometime between 1909 and 1912, and is the oldest continuously operating school in the Abbotsford School District. The Mount Lehman United Church was established in 1894, and the community hall was built in 1904. The school, hall and church have all operated continuously since they were created. Until 1910, logging still provided the livelihoods for most of the settlers to the area. Then in 1910 a nearby stop on the new British Columbia Electric Railway changed how the community grew. The railway linked Chilliwack to Vancouver through Mt. Lehman. Eventually, the store was moved from the landing to the school, and then to the site of the railway crossing, along with the post office. Soon a hardware store and service station were added at this same location. Around this time many Mt. Lehman pioneers began to raise vegetables and dairy products. With the arrival of the rail, valley communities became less dependent on the Fraser's paddle-wheelers to take their milk and produce to market in New Westminster. From 1910-1952 the BC Electric Railway provided passenger trains and freight service twice daily and an extra market train came through on Fridays. They also had a milk train every morning to carry dairy products. By the 1930s Mt.Lehman was thriving and consisted of a hardware store, a feed co-operative, a bank, 2 general stores, a post office, a shoe maker shop, a butcher shop, a library, and a train station. Today Mount Lehman is known as a peaceful rural community, with a mix of busy farms, local estate wineries, small acreages and estate homes. This vibrant community retains its charm, and is an important living link to the region's history. Typical economic activities found in the area include the raising of chickens, llamas, and to a lesser extent, cattle. Horse raising and boarding stables are also prevalent. There are wine vineyards, blueberry and raspberry farms, as well as orchards and tree farms. There are several major greenhouses that grow crops such as cucumbers, tomatoes and peppers. The opening of several bed and breakfasts has also made the area a new draw for tourists looking to experience a taste of rural living. Although there are no major supermarkets, gas stations, or corner stores in the immediate area, these are all within a 10 minutes drive. The growth of nearby Abbotsford overshadowed the importance of some of the previously mentioned amenities, and many of these eventually closed down. However, Mount Lehman does offer its own small list of basic amenities. There is a one-room branch of the Fraser Valley Regional Library, the post office is still in operation, there is a fire hall, credit union, insurance shop and a small auto repair shop. The railway continues to operate but ownership has changed and it is now known as the Southern Railway of British Columbia (aka SRY Rail Link). Although the train station closed to passenger traffic in 1952, today, activists are looking at the former B.C. Electric Rail line as a resurrected public transit option. In addition, the United Church and Mount Lehman hall and school are still in operation, and there is an outlet of the Army and Navy that provides a social meeting spot for mostly locals on Friday evenings. The Taylor home, built by the pioneering family of the same name, is the oldest heritage home in Mount Lehman and still stands on Taylor Road. The Mount Lehman cemetery, also on Taylor Road, is one of the oldest cemeteries in the city of Abbotsford and is still in use today. Each year there are various community events such as the Canada Day Parade and Mount Lehman Fall Fair. As well the Mt. Lehman Hall hosts various other events and can be rented out for weddings and other functions. Although there is a historic walking trail at the end of Landing Road leading to the old Lehman's Landing, sections of this trail were recently washed away or buried under landslides. The city of Abbotsford has deemed the area unstable and therefore unsafe for use. A sign has been posted at the start of the trail informing would be users that the trail is closed and urges them to keep out. 49°07′07″N 122°22′48″W﻿ ﻿49.1186°N 122.3800°W﻿ 49.1186; -122.3800",Normal

"Amet Seid Abdulla oğlu Özenbaşlı (10 February 1893 – 4 December 1958) was a Crimean Tatar politician and writer. A leading member of the Crimean Tatar nationalist movement and a minister in the Crimean People's Republic, he was later involved in the Crimean Tatar community in the Soviet Union. After supporting Crimean Tatar collaboration with Nazi Germany during World War II, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison, but was released in 1955. Following his prison service, he lived in Tajikistan until his death. Amet Özenbaşlı was born on 10 February 1893 in Bakhchysarai. His father was Seid Abdulla Özenbaşlı, a prominent Crimean Tatar writer and musician. In 1914, he graduated from the M. A. Voloshenko men's gymnasium in Simferopol. For some time, he worked in the publishing house of Ismail Gasprinsky, working in Arabic calligraphy and graphic design. From 1915 to 1917, he studied at the medical faculty of the Imperial University of Novorossiya in Odessa. In 1917, amidst the Russian Revolution, Özenbaşlı was a member of the Executive Committee of the Provisional Muslim Revolutionary Committee, the Council of People's Representatives, and a delegate to the Qurultay of the Crimean Tatar People. Though a socialist, he was also a Crimean Tatar nationalist, and was the delegate of Crimean Tatars to the Congress of the Enslaved Peoples of Russia. He was a leading member of the Milliy Firqa, and, during the Crimean People's Republic, served as minister of education. In 1918, Özenbaşlı participated in the Crimean Regional Government, and, alongside Maciej Sulkiewicz, was a participant in negotiations with the Ukrainian State in Kyiv. During the Russian Civil War, he was targeted by the White movement and, after the Red Army occupied Crimea, he joined Bolshevik authorities. In 1920, he founded the Şirket agricultural cooperative, which had branches throughout Crimea and included several former members of the Milliy Firqa. From 1922 to 1924, Özenbaşlı served as a psychology teacher, and head of the psychology department at the Crimean Tatar Pedagogical Institute. In 1922, he graduated from the medical faculty of the Tavrida National V.I. Vernadsky University, receiving a diploma in neuropathology. He was a leading member of the Koç Yardim (lit. 'Help for Settlers') programme, which aimed to facilitate the return of Crimean Tatars from Turkey and Bulgaria. From 1924 to 1927, he served as Deputy People's Commissar of Finance of the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Afterwards, he worked as a neuropathologist at the third polyclinic of Simferopol. However, this work would not last long; in April 1928, he was arrested in connection with his work as a member of the Milliy Firqa, and sentenced to death in December 1928. This sentence, however, was soon overturned by ten years of hard labour in the Transbaikal region. From 1931 to 1934, he worked in the construction of the White Sea–Baltic Canal as a doctor for prisoners. In 1934, he was released, and subsequently worked in Novosibirsk and Pavlohrad as a doctor. Amidst World War II, Özenbaşlı returned to Crimea. He collaborated with Nazi forces, and called on Crimean Tatars to join the Nazis to expel the Soviets and create an independent Crimea under German tutelage. As the Germans retreated, he fled to Romania, where he was captured and sent back to Moscow. In 1947, he was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment. In 1955, however, he was released early, and moved to Leninabad, in the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic (now Khujand in independent Tajikistan). He lived in Leninabad until his death on 4 December 1958. On 8 August 1993, his ashes were reburied in the Zincirli Madrasa in Bakhchysarai, next to Ismail Gasprinsky, according to his will.",Normal

"The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) is one of the two organizations resulting from the division of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The counterpart is the Pakistan Airport Authority, representing the split of responsibilities and functions within the aviation sector. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation was established with the primary objective of enhancing the investigation process for accidents and incidents arising from aircraft navigation in Pakistan. This creation was prompted by the necessity to address the demands made by the European Union and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to lift the ban on Pakistan Airlines. Improving safety investigation practices and procedures was a critical step towards meeting the standards required for the removal of restrictions on Pakistan Airlines by international aviation authorities. The establishment of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation was a component of the Pakistan Air Safety Investigation Bill - 2023. This legislative initiative was successfully passed by the National Assembly of Pakistan on July 27, 2023. MNA Saad Waseem Akhtar Sheikh introduced the bill on behalf of Aviation Minister Khawaja Saad Rafique. The primary objective of this bill was to enhance the investigation process for accidents and incidents arising from aircraft navigation within Pakistan. Following its approval by the Senate Standing Committee on Aviation on August 2, 2023, the ""Pakistan Air Safety Investigation Bill - 2023"" underwent a second successful passage through the National Assembly on August 3, 2023. Subsequently, the President of Pakistan, Arif Alvi, provided his approval for the bill on August 7, 2023. This process solidified the establishment of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, marking a significant development in enhancing the investigation of aviation accidents and incidents within Pakistan. The determination to split the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) into two distinct entities, namely the Pakistan Airport Authority and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, was made by a nine-member committee appointed by the Ministry of Aviation. The committee was granted a deadline of October 15 to finalize its work and recommendations regarding this significant division of the aviation regulatory body. Despite recommendations from foreign experts, the federal government has yet to implement the suggestion to make the Civil Aviation Authority’s (CAA) Safety Investigation Board (SIB) an independent body. Although the board was detached from the Ministry of Defence, the proposed plan to grant it independence and separate it entirely from direct government supervision, by placing it under the prime minister's oversight, has not been acted upon and remains pending. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, in conjunction with the Pakistan Airport Authority, will undertake the responsibility of distributing the existing assets and funds of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Additionally, they will oversee the smooth transition of employees, records, offices, and furniture from the CAA, ensuring a seamless transfer of resources and personnel to the newly established entities.",Normal

"The Italian colonial railways started with the opening in 1888 of a short section of line in Italian Eritrea, and ended in 1943 with the loss of Italian Libya after the Allied offensive in North Africa and the destruction of the railways around Italian Tripoli. The colonial railways of the Kingdom of Italy reached 1,561 kilometres (970mi) before WWII. The construction of railways in the African Italian colonies (Eritrea, Libya and Somalia) did not have, for various reasons, a great development compared to that promoted by other European countries on the same continent. The first rail lines were built mainly for war needs in the absence of efficient means of communication in the occupied territories, after the conquests of Eritrea and Libya. However, were quite limited in the first decades of occupation. In 1940 the amount of railways in operation, between Italian East Africa and Libya, amounted to 1,556km of which, however, the 693km of the Italian section of the Railway Djibouti-Addis Ababa were pre-existing and built by the French Empire for Ethiopia. The railways were built by Italy from the outset with little potential, because built with narrow gauge rails and with light metal type, and were never of great economic importance because isolated from the lines of neighboring states. Indeed, the choice of a gauge 950mm (3ft1+3⁄8in), different from the meter gauge usually used in Africa, contributed to this effect. Today most of these Italian colonial railways have disappeared: those of Somalia after the British occupation in 1941–1945. The Libyan ones were suppressed in the 1960s, but in the same decade the Eritrean railway between Italian Asmara and Massawa was reactivated after long neglect of trafficking. In 1940 there were some projects of new colonial railways in the Italian Empire: Two international projects were studied for decades, but never done because of excessive financial difficulties: All these projects were stopped by the WW2 defeat of Italy. In 1940 the Italian colonial railways had 1,561km and were the following: With the above railways there were some decauville railways, like:",Normal

"The leader of the Conservative Party (officially the leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party) is the highest position within the United Kingdom's Conservative Party. The current holder of the position is Rishi Sunak, who was elected to the position on 24 October 2022, following his unopposed victory in the party's leadership election. From the party's formation in 1834 until 1922, the leader of the Conservative Party was not a formal position; instead, there was a party leader in each chamber of Parliament, and they were considered equal unless one took precedence over the other, such as when one was serving as prime minister. Following the passage of the Parliament Act of 1911, the reduction of power in the House of Lords suggested that the Conservative leader in the House of Commons would be preeminent, but this fact was not formalised until 1922. Since 1922, a leader of the Conservative Party has been formally elected, even when the party is in opposition. Originally, the party leader was appointed opaquely by other high-ranking members of the party. This process was gradually democratised in the late 20th century; in 1965, the appointment was linked to a vote by party MPs, and in 1998, the process was opened to all party members to decide between the last two candidates selected by parliamentarians. Under party rules, members can vote in the Conservative leadership even if they are not British citizens, do not live in the UK and do not have the right to vote in a UK general election. When the Conservative Party is in government, as it currently is, the leader would usually become the prime minister of the United Kingdom, first lord of the Treasury and minister for the civil service, as well as appointing the cabinet. Concordantly, when the Party is in opposition, the leader of the Conservative Party usually acts (as the second largest party) as the Leader of the Opposition, and chairs the shadow cabinet. As of October 2022, three of the party's leaders have been women: Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May, and Liz Truss, all of whom have served as prime minister. Rishi Sunak is the first British Asian party leader and prime minister. Under the party's constitution, leaders are elected by serving MPs and party members whose membership started at least three months prior to the closing of a ballot. Candidates must be serving MPs. A former leader who has resigned may not stand in the contest triggered by their departure. Those who wish to stand must notify the 1922 Committee, a body representing backbench Conservative Party MPs, which has broad powers to set the rules of the leadership race (e.g. the minimum number of nominees candidates need). The party's practice is for MPs to eliminate candidates through multiple rounds of voting until two remain, from whom the winner is then chosen by a ballot of party members. The 1922 Committee's chairman acts as the returning officer for all stages of the leadership election process. Those asterisked were considered the overall leader of the party. Those asterisked were considered the overall leader of the party. Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party is sometimes an official title of a senior Conservative politician of the United Kingdom. Some are given this title officially by the party, such as Peter Lilley, while others are given the title as an unofficial description by the media, such as William Hague. The first politician to hold the office as such was Reginald Maudling, appointed by Edward Heath in 1965. Distinct from being ""second-in-command"", there is formally no current position of deputy party leader in the party's hierarchy. The term has sometimes been mistakenly used to refer to the party's deputy chair.",Normal
"Alan Cantwell (born 1968) is an Irish journalist, presenter and newsreader, best known as the former anchor of TV3 News at 5.30 and later the 5.30. Cantwell began his broadcasting career at the age of seventeen working in pirate radio in Dublin. He spent a number of years working with Capitol Radio under the pseudonym of Dave Carney. He later joined legitimate radio when he moved to Clare FM in the early 1990s. He spent five years here as head of news and current affairs. He subsequently became editor-in-chief of Independent Network News (INN) in Dublin. He later joined 98FM as host of a popular late-night chat show. In 1998 Cantwell joined TV3 when the new station launched in September that year. Since then he has been the station's lead male newsreader. When TV3 launched Midday in 2008, Cantwell was included as one of the presenters along with Colette Fitzpatrick and Martin King. His stint in this role proved controversial and earned him the nickname ""Alan Rantwell""; he was dropped from the programme after just a year as presenter. His removal was part of a wider shake-up of the programme. In May 2011, Cantwell fronted TV3's television coverage of Queen Elizabeth II's visit to the Republic of Ireland.

"The Tallahassee Police Department (TPD) is the municipal police for that provides public safety services for the city of Tallahassee, Florida, United States. Within the department, there are twelve primary divisions: The Chief of Police, Internal Affairs, Development Bureau, Investigations, Traffic Enforcement, Crime Analysis Unit, Public Information Office, Towing Administration, Property & Evidence, Operations Bureau, Technology, Records, and Special Operations. The city's police force began operation in 1826, shortly after the city was incorporated, with a single City Marshal constituting the police force. From time to time, special police were hired as circumstances warranted. A compulsory Night Watch was also instituted for a period of time before the Civil War. The Tallahassee Police Department once claimed to be the oldest continuously-operated police department in the American South, and possibly the second-oldest in the U.S., preceded only by the Philadelphia Police Department established in 1758. The Boston Police Department was established in 1838. Larger east coast cities followed with New York City and Baltimore in 1845. However, Colonial America must have had municipal police forces, but lack of verifiable records may make it difficult, if not impossible, to accurately rank police forces from oldest to newest. Southern public officials were suspended from public office from May - November 1865 by the occupying Federal troops, except for marshals and police. Therefore, Tallahassee's police force continued to operate during late 1865 while most other officials ceased to hold any official powers. To illustrate the difficulty in ranking municipal police forces from oldest to newest, Pensacola, Florida—for example—began its police force as early as 1822—predating Tallahassee's. With Reconstruction and civil rights bestowed on black citizens, for several years during the 1870s, much of the Tallahassee City Council and the entire police force—including the City Marshal—were black. Also during this period, the only two blacks ever to serve as Leon County Sheriff until November 2016 occupied that post. But, the era of the black Southern public official was short lived and, with passage of Florida's 1885 Constitution (replacing the 1868 ""carpetbagger"" Constitution), black suffrage was effectively quashed. Control of public offices became white-only (until the 1964 Civil Rights Act). In 1892, the position of City Marshal was renamed to Chief of Police. This appointee was typically nominated by the Mayor and ratified by the City Council. After the 1920 change from a strong mayor form of government to the Commission-Manager form of government, the City Commission appointed the Police Chief—until the late 1920s—when the Police Chief became an employee appointed directly by the City Manager without input from the City Commission. The Tallahassee Police Department was the subject of intense scrutiny after a botched buy-bust operation ended in a fatal tragedy on May 7, 2008, with the execution-style murder of 23-year-old Rachel Hoffman. Hoffman, a recent graduate of Florida State University who had been convicted of drug charges, was serving in an undercover capacity, alone, when she was murdered by two suspected drug dealers while nearly 20 TPD officers and a DEA plane were supervising the operation. A subsequent grand jury investigation was highly critical of the planning and execution of the operation, and a subsequent TPD internal affairs investigation found negligence and multiple policy violations by the Vice squad and individual police officers involved. Following Hoffman's death, the Florida legislature enacted ""Rachel's Law,"" and established minimum guidelines for law enforcement to use when engaging civilians in undercover operations. In a civil suit alleging wrongful death, the City of Tallahassee paid the Hoffman family $2.6 million in damages. In 2008 a Tallahassee resident, Robert Brayshaw, was arrested for violating a Florida statute which prohibited individuals from ""maliciously, with intent to obstruct the due execution of the law or with the intent to intimidate, hinder or interrupt any law enforcement officer in the legal performance of his or her duties, publish or disseminate the residence address or telephone number of any law enforcement officer while designating the officer as such..."" Brayshaw had posted, online, the name of a Tallahassee police officer, along with her home address, cell phone number and age, and had further criticized the officer, stating that she was verbally abusive, rude and unprofessional. Brayshaw brought an action in federal court, challenging the constitutionality of the Florida statute, claiming a right to free speech under the First Amendment. The case was heard in U.S. District Court. On April 30, 2010, Judge Richard Smoak ruled in favor of Brayshaw, striking down the 1972 Florida law, finding that the statute was ""unconstitutional on its face"". Smoak also ordered the city of Tallahassee to pay Brayshaw's legal expenses of $25,000. The State of Florida paid $35,000 for the challenge of the law as declared Unconstititional on its face. WIRED Magazine ran multiple stories billing the case as ""The ""Dumbest Ever"". Michael Dilmore (Badge #694) was the arresting officer of The Tallahassee Police Department with a false police report. On April 16, 2014, The New York Times reported irregularities in the investigation of an alleged sexual assault involving Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston. A medical examination of the unnamed female revealed injuries consistent with sexual contact—bruises, semen—and the woman would later identify Jameis Winston by name as her alleged attacker. Tallahassee police did not promptly obtain a DNA sample from Winston. When police contacted Winston by phone, he initially delayed responding. Then, on advice from his attorney, Winston declined to be interviewed. The initial TPD investigation did not uncover the fact that a video of the sexual encounter had been taken by Seminoles teammate Chris Casher. The video was later deleted or lost by Casher. On May 27, 2020, a white TPD officer shot 38-year-old African-American Tony McDade, a 38-year-old trans man, following reports of a fatal stabbing in Leon Arms Apartments. The evening before the incident, McDade was physically assaulted. He later posted a video on Facebook in which he vowed to kill his attackers and would rather die at the hands of police than return to prison. The incident drew criticism as official police statements described McDade as a ""woman"" who ""identified as a man"". Eyewitness statements to local media contradicted police statements that McDade was armed with a gun at the time. A vigil was organised for May 28, this being the third police-shooting (after Wilbon Cleveland Woodard, and Mychael Johnson) since the appointment of Ravell as Chief of Police in December 2019. Lawrence Revell has been named the new Tallahassee Police chief on December 26, 2019. The Internal Affairs Unit is responsible for ensuring the citizens of Tallahassee can trust the police department. They conduct compliance reviews and maintain the records for high-liability police actions, coordinate and assess secondary employment opportunities, and process, investigate, and maintain managerial oversight of any citizen complaints to ensure all police personnel comply with professional standards. The Internal Affairs Unit is responsible for: Internal Investigations (Formal Complaints), Contact Reports (Informal Complaints), Special Investigations (Firearm Discharges), Vehicle Pursuit Compliance Reviews, Use of Force Compliance Reviews, Employee Traffic Crash Compliance Reviews, Secondary Employment Coordination and Compliance Reviews  The Special Operations Bureau includes sworn police officers and civilians. It is responsible for traffic related operations and other specialty operations. The units are Traffic Enforcement, Special Events Panning, Parking Enforcement, Downtown Officers, Child Passenger Seat Safety Seat Inspections, and Reserve units. The Organizational Development Bureau includes Building and Fleet Unit, Training Unit and Communications. The Criminal Investigations Bureau is responsible for investigating crimes that occur in the City of Tallahassee. It consists of four specialized units: Property Crimes, Persons Crimes, Cold CasesCrime Stoppers and Forensics. The High Risk Offenders Bureau is composed of the Special Investigations Unit and the Violent Crimes Response Section. The Crime Analysis Unit employs civilian personnel. It includes an Executive Crime Analyst Supervisor and six Crime Intelligence Analysts. The unit was decentralized in 2016 and are embedded in the Operations (Patrol) Bureau, High Risk Offenders Bureau (HRO), and Criminal Investigations Bureau (CIB)  The Public Information Office provides a connection between the citizens of Tallahassee and the Tallahassee Police Department. The office plays a primary role in maintaining the public trust. Members of the office serve as the official spokespersons for the department. They also coordinate responses with the media and civilian inquiries. The PIO encourages a partnership between the community and the police department with events like departmental tours, ""Shop with A Cop"", ""Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day"" and the ""TPD and You Breakfast"" with the Police Chief.

"William Reuben Thomas (May 24, 1866 - September 10, 1943) was a politician and businessman from Gainesville, Florida. Thomas was a native of Gainesville, Florida. After graduating college he became a teacher at the East Florida Seminary. There he gained the title Major which he retained throughout his life. Major Thomas represented Alachua County for four years in the Florida Senate. He served as Senate President in 1895 and Senate President Pro Tempore in 1897. Following his state legislative service, Thomas served six terms as Gainesville's mayor from 1901 through 1907. As Mayor, he ushered in the city's first paved streets, sidewalks, sewers, and electric lights. Out of office, Thomas also provided political leadership. When, in 1923, Gainesville's then mayor and police chief condoned criminal activity by the Ku Klux Klan, Thomas wrote an editorial calling for both men to resign. Compared to other cities, Gainesville was relatively immune to Klan incited violence. Contemporary commentators have attributed this to Major Thomas’ willingness to publicly stand against those who supported the Klan. Thomas was an active businessman owning banks and hardware, livery and stable, and grocery businesses. Thomas also owned two hotels. The White House Hotel was a hostelry, or home for travelers, that Thomas opened in 1909. The Hotel Thomas provided more luxurious accommodations to tourists. Thomas sold $160,000 worth of bonds to raise money to convert his private residence in northeast Gainesville into the Hotel Thomas in 1926. The renovation included consolidation of six city blocks. Today the City of Gainesville owns the building which is now named the William Reuben Thomas Center, and which houses city offices, event space, and cultural and historical exhibits. Major Thomas’ most lasting accomplishment was securing Gainesville as the home of the University of Florida. During the summer of 1905, Florida Governor Napoleon B. Broward established a board to consolidate the state's education system under a single regulatory body and to establish a single university for white males. Mayor Thomas led the campaign to locate this university in Gainesville. Thomas personally donated 517 acres (2.09km2) of land to entice the state to choose Gainesville. He succeeded and Thomas Hall, one of the first two buildings constructed at the University of Florida, is named in Major Thomas’ honor.",Normal

"Adolfo Müller-Ury, KSG (March 29, 1862– July 6, 1947) was a Swiss-born American portrait painter and impressionistic painter of roses and still life. Felice Adolfo Müller was born on 29 March 1862 at Airolo, Switzerland, to a prominent patrician family that by the 18th and 19th centuries included mercenaries, lawyers, hoteliers and businessmen. Adolfo was the sixth of nineteen children, most of whom survived infancy, born to Roman Catholic parents: Carl Alois Müller (1825–1887), a lawyer, was Gerichtspräsident (Presiding Judge) of the Cantonal Courts, and Genovefa (née Lombardi; 1836–1920), daughter of Felice Lombardi, Director of the Hospice on the St Gotthard Pass, which he took over from the Capuchin monks who had run it for centuries. The family spoke Airolese mainly, a local dialect of Ticinese Italian, as well as Swiss-German. After attending the municipal drawing school in the Ticino, and school in Sarnen he was encouraged by the sculptor Vincenzo Vela (1820–1891) and possibly the Commendatore Metalli-Stresa (a family friend), to study oil painting under the local painter of religious pictures in a Nazarene-style, Melchior Paul von Deschwanden in Stans in Switzerland (who died in Adolfo's arms in February 1881). On April 25, 1881, he entered the Munich Academy, where he stayed 18 months, studying with Professors Alexander Strähuber (1814–82), Alois Gabl (1845–93), Gyula Benczur (1844–1920), and possibly Karl von Piloty; on the same day, a fellow Swiss called Adalbert Baggenstos (1863–97), who originated from Stans, also registered at the Munich Academy. Between Munich and Paris he spent nearly two years (1882–84) in Rome, studying and copying Old Masters, apparently at the instigation of the distinguished Ticinese-born artist Antonio Ciseri (1821–1891), and where he apparently painted portraits of Cardinals Joseph Hergenröther and Gustav Adolf Hohenlohe who were acquaintances of his uncle Josef, a Domherr in Chur, Switzerland. His known early work is necessarily varied, and includes pictures in the style of Deschwanden (usually signed Müller, Adolfo), academic drawings executed in Munich (usually signed Ad. Müller), copies of Old Masters, and early independent oils, sometimes was influenced by artist's like Robert Zünd (1827–1909) and Frank Buchser (1828–1890) which includes landscapes, genre and religious pictures. Many of these survive in the ancestral home of the Müllers in Hospental, Switzerland, and with surviving members of his family in the St Gotthard and elsewhere. Whilst in Paris in late 1884 he decided to visit America. He arrived first in Milwaukee, and then visited Chicago and St Paul, Minnesota, where he had relatives. In 1885 he went to Baltimore to paint James Cardinal Gibbons for the first time and in 1886 completed a full-length portrait which was given to the Cardinal for his residence after being exhibited at Schaus's Gallery in New York (missing). At around this time he was travelling all over the eastern United States painting and executed a very large canvas of the Bushkill Falls in Pennsylvania (Von der Heydt Museum, Wuppertal, Germany). Luckily for the artist, his talent for portraiture was soon noticed by the St. Paul railroad builder James J. Hill, who was to commission or acquire many pictures of himself, his family, his friends and business associates, like the Canadian missionary Father Albert Lacombe in 1895, and John Stewart Kennedy the financier in 1901. In the Newark Museum, New Jersey, is a portrait of a little girl dressed in pink called Miss Brandeis which is probably his first commissioned picture made in America (it is signed with a variation of his family name, A. Lombardi-Muller), though a portrait of Father Joseph Fransioli, who was minister to the large influx of Italian-speaking immigrants arriving in New York, today at the Brooklyn Historical Society, was possibly completed before this as it is signed Adolph Muller. It would seem that from quite early on he wanted to sign his works in a way that was unique to him, and so portraits between 1886 and 1889 are sometimes signed F. Adolphus Muller, A. Muller-Uri, or Muller d'Uri. By 1890 this was fully anglicized as A. Muller-Ury, the umlaut in his surname being dropped. Some of his later smaller works are signed A M Ury. (As late as 1932, the Swiss-American Historical Society published a book on Swiss-Americans where his name was inaccurately stated as Adolph Felix Muller-Uri.) In 1889 he painted a portrait of John R. Brady a New York Judge which was apparently presented to the American Bar Association. He may have travelled in North Africa in the summer of 1889 after visiting the Exposition Universelle as he dated a Portrait of a North African man with a Gun (previously known as Portrait of an Arab; Private Collection, London) that year and exhibited a picture called In the Dark Continent at the National Academy of Design in New York at the end of that year (No. 105; lost). In 1890 he completed a second bust-length portrait of Father Joseph Fransioli of Brooklyn (lost). His New York studio 1885–1904 was in the Sherwood Studio Building, 58 West 57th Street and 6th Avenue (the building has been long demolished), where he is noted before 1889 in Room C; by 1894 he had a studio with a waiting room (both lit by windows) and a bedroom. Other artists who rented studios in the building in the 1880s were his friend from Munich, Jan Chełmiński (who later married the sister of art dealer Roland Knoedler), landscape painter Robert W. Van Boskerck, James Carroll Beckwith, painter and muralist Edwin Howland Blashfield, and painter turned critic Arthur Hoeber, and later artists such as Carle Blenner and portraitist George Burroughs Torrey. He was photographed in his Sherwood studio by artist turned photographer Edwin Scott Bennett (1847–1915) which was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the Society of Amateur Photographers of New York in 1894. For a number of years he commuted between New York and Europe. In 1892, after the great success of his portraits of Senator Chauncey Depew in 1890 (Yale Club of New York City) and Mrs Theodore Havemeyer in 1891 (now the property of the Preservation Society of Newport County, Rhode Island), he applied for United States citizenship. It was apparently at this date that he met the young art dealer Joseph Duveen, who was to become a close friend, and after 1891 that he began to be dubbed 'Painter to the Four Hundred', referring to the elite of New York society in whose circles he socialized. He was much aided by the Havemeyers, and also by Louis Benziger (1840–1896), a Roman Catholic publisher (Benziger Brothers), who persuaded many New Yorkers to sit for him; he remained friendly with his son Bruno Benziger until his death, and indeed Bruno Benziger organized the artist's burial. For three years in the late 1890s he leased one of the studios in Pembroke Studios in Kensington, London, where he certainly painted portraits of Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal, and Lord Mount Stephen who were business associates of James J. Hill, of whom he made an etching in London in 1898 which was distributed to Hill's family and colleagues. According to a letter he wrote to Hill he started the portrait of Consuelo Yznaga, the 8th Duchess of Manchester, in London in 1898, but it is not known if it was ever completed. In 1903 he was one of a group of artists who invested in a new studio building, the Atelier Building, 33 West 67th Street. Muller-Ury lived in the top floor right studio, and incorporated a stained glass panel of the Müller coat-of-arms into the window (removed in 1947 and now at the Haus Müller in Hospental, Switzerland). The floors were all inlaid with borders of intarsia, and the smaller windows given mullions. He moved into the studio in 1904 and remained there until 1947. Political figures: Several Swiss politicians who became Presidents: He also painted the first permanent diplomatic representative of Switzerland in the United Kingdom, then Swiss Minister in London, Dr Charles Daniel Bourcart of Basel (now at the Swiss Embassy in London). The Roman Catholic Hierarchy: Famous international opera singers: Popular actresses: Other sitters include: In 1896 A Boston newspaper reported that, ‘... Mr. Müller-Ury, the portrait painter, who has just returned from abroad, has taken an attractive studio in Everett street, Newport, the one occupied by Mr. Harper Pennington last season. Mr. Müller-Ury’s roses as well as his portraits are admired, and he is painting a huge basket of American Beauties for the Havemeyer villa.’ In a surviving photograph of the artist’s studio in the Sherwood taken in 1894 (a portrait of Monsignor Satolli is on the easel next to it) there is huge still life, and in a letter from his studio to James J. Hill dated 12 August 1895 (Hill Papers, St. Paul, MN) he says that he hopes that the 'flower peace ' he sent to him 'will suit for the place intended for', further evidence that he had painted some still lifes before 1896. After 1918 the style of his still lifes becomes more impressionistic, the technique more painterly and using a great deal of impasto, and usually depict roses in Chinese vases from the former collection of J. Pierpont Morgan that he copied at the galleries of Duveen Brothers in New York (Duveen's exhibited the Morgan collection in 1919) and elsewhere, and sometimes including depictions of other works of art like bronze or biscuit porcelain statuettes, Chinese porcelain Buddhas, Italian maiolica plates and so on. It is known he was an admirer of Claude Monet and others, as he told the German Kaiser – who hated the Impressionists – in 1909 that the Impressionists had ""done a great deal to awaken modern art."" The roses were claimed by the soprano Jessica Dragonette in her autobiography to be the varieties American Beauty (red), La France (pink), Belle of Portugal (pale pink), Claudius, Killarney (rose pink), and Boucher-Pierné, but there were others. Many of his impressionistic rose paintings were created after he moved to California. In March 1922 he travelled with Sir Joseph Duveen (later Lord Duveen) to California for the first time, in order that Duveen could deliver to bibliophile and art collector Henry E. Huntington Gainsborough's famous picture The Blue Boy which Huntington had bought the previous year. Duveen had promised the artist that Huntington would commission a portrait of himself. He did not. Müller-Ury liked California and after painting Archbishop Edward Joseph Hanna in San Francisco in 1923 decided the following year to erect a studio near Huntington's estate. The studio he built was at the corner of Monterey and Shenandoah Roads in San Marino (architect Carleton Winslow), in the fashionable Spanish style with a green tiled roof and in the studio an enormous north-facing window. He placed the Muller coat-of-arms on the east frontage, where it may be found today. The gardens were extensively planted with many varieties of roses including Radiance, Columbia, Rose Marie, Irish Charm, Imperial Potentate and American Beauty which he painted into his canvases depicting the Morgan porcelains begun in New York. Duveen built a bungalow next door to the artist on Shenandoah Road, but seems to have quickly sold it after the death of his client Henry E. Huntington in 1927. It was in San Marino during the following years, that Muller-Ury executed portraits of the following sitters: In 1926, Müller-Ury seems to have begun from a photograph of a portrait of Henry E. Huntington standing (now at the Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena) and a seated one (which was engraved by Witherspoon) as well as another smaller seated version which was acquired by John and Elizabeth Huntington Metcalf; his portrait of their daughter Mary Brockway Metcalf was for some years hanging in the lobby to the office of the Director of the Huntington Library. In 1930, Müller-Ury painted the former Miss Gladys Quarré of San Francisco (then Mrs Frederick Peabody of Montecito, Santa Barbara); later she became known as Gladys Quarré Knapp, a socialite and friend of many Hollywood actors. He also painted a large allegorical work entitled The Spirit of California a version of which was acquired by a prominent art collector called Fred Elbridge Keeler (lost). Müller-Ury abandoned the studio for the last time on September 3, 1933, after which it was let to friends. The house was apparently used by the Red Cross during the Second World War. He sold it in January 1947 for about half its value because nobody was prepared at that time to buy a property where most rooms were comparatively small except for the enormous studio. After his return from California he settled permanently back in his New York studio. In 1936 he travelled to Europe and he may have done so in 1937 and certainly in 1938 when he painted a large portrait of President Motta of Switzerland, for his home town of Bellinzona (Archivio Cantonale). In 1937 he painted a portrait of Ellen Dunlap Hopkins, founder of the New York School of Applied Design for Women which he presented to the School in 1938 (Private collection, Brooklyn). He painted Pope Pius XII in 1936 during his visit to the United States when still Cardinal Pacelli, only finishing the work in 1939 (by painting in the white robes after his election to the pontificate), and painted his friend Cardinal Francis Spellman of New York twice in 1940 (St Joseph's Seminary, Yonkers) one version being presented by Manhattan College to Fordham University in 1941 (who appear to have lost the work), and again in 1942; he also painted Archbishop Joseph Rummell of New Orleans (1943). In 1940, he painted the then-famous radio soprano Jessica Dragonette (Georgian Court College, New Jersey) and several times thereafter, his last portrait in 1946 depicting her bust-length in a gold fez. In 1941 he produced a portrait of her sister Rosalinda (always called Nadea) Loftus looking over her shoulder. He also painted Dragonette's colleague Fred Mitchell, and several portraits of her friends and acquaintances. In 1942, at age 80, he painted a three-quarter length seated portrait of Mrs George H. Ingalls (née Katharine Davis Hinkle), whose late husband, a descendant of one of the founder families of America who had left Lincolnshire in 1628, had been a Vice-President of the New York Central Railroad. Müller-Ury died, apparently of cancer, on July 6, 1947, at the Lenox Hill Hospital, New York and is buried in New Calvary Cemetery, Queens, New York, where his gravestone is marked simply, if incorrectly, 'ADOLPH MULLER-URY 1862–1947'. On Thursday, July 10, 1947, a Requiem Mass was held for the artist in St. Patrick's Cathedral. After his death his youngest brother Otto Müller travelled to New York to settle his estate. Most of his studio contents, and a good many of his pictures, were sold in two sales at the Plaza Art Galleries, 28 and 29 November 1947 (No. 2809) and 5 December 1947 (No. 2813), including his oil sketch of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, and the portrait of Lina Cavalieri. The Frick Art Reference Library, New York, has a copy of both catalogues, where the prices for his pictures are marked; three extra lots were included in the second sale. Müller-Ury exhibited single pictures and groups of pictures in the following venues (the list is not exhaustive): The largest public collections of his works are: The Historisches Museum von Uri, Altdorf, Switzerland which has ten pictures, including a large allegorical work painted in 1888 called Alpenrose und Edelweiss, and portraits of his father and his uncle (all three donated by him in 1905 when the Museum was first opened). The Preservation Society of Newport County, Rhode Island, who were given six of the portraits and two etchings by Muller-Ury in the American Heritage Center at the University of Wyoming in Laramie in 2007 to add to the six they already possessed five of which are of the Havemeyer family (this collection included Governor Merriam of St Paul as well as his etchings of railroad builder James J. Hill and Senator Chauncey Depew and was donated to Wyoming by Nicholas M. Turner, husband of the soprano Jessica Dragonette, who at one time owned nearly forty pictures by the artist many bought at his studio sale in 1947). They also acquired from Wyoming the artist's hands modelled by Gertrude Colburn (died 1968). The National Portrait Gallery in Washington has nine portraits, including President William McKinley, General Henry Clarke Corbin, James J. Hill, the two etchings of James J. Hill and Chauncey Depew, and two oils that the American Heritage Center at the University of Wyoming in Laramie gave them in 2007 from the Dragonette Collection: a Self-portrait and a portrait of steel titan Charles M. Schwab. In 2009 they acquired a drawing of Anaconda Copper Mining Millionaire Marcus Daly. The New York State Museum at Albany contains six portraits, five of which were in the former New York Chamber of Commerce: Theodore Havemeyer, Oswald Ottendorfer, James Constable, William 'Boyce' Thompson, and Benjamin Altman. Much of his work remains in private collections or with the descendants of his sitters, and many of the portraits of his most famous sitters are apparently lost. However, his recently rediscovered 1923 portrait of his great friend Sir Joseph Duveen, the art dealer, has been recently widely reproduced, notably on the cover of the 2004 biography of Duveen by Meryle Secrest; it was subsequently sold at TEFAF Maastricht in 2006 for $95,000. Hildegarde Muller-Uri (born 1894, Greenwich Village, New York City – died 1990) – actually born Hildegarde Petronella Bernhardina Muller – an American visual artist, was a relative, and in fact a third cousin, of Müller-Ury. She was the eldest daughter of amateur artist Henry Muller and his wife Wilhelmina, both of whom were of course natives of Canton Uri in Switzerland. Henry Muller had moved from New York to San Augustine in around 1898 to work as a chef in one of Henry Flagler's hotels, and later became to builder and owner of the Hotel Marion at 128 Bay Street. She studied first with Hugh H. Breckinridge (1870–1937) at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and at the Breckenridge Art School in East Gloucester, Massachusetts, between 1925 and 1930, and later at the Art Students League with Frank Vincent Dumond (1865–1951) and possibly with Olinsky, Lewis, and others. She exhibited at the Society of Independent Artists 1929 to 1931. She founded and directed the Galleon Art School in San Augustine in 1925, but this was more a club for artists than a school, so by 1931 she founded the San Augustine Arts Club, where she proved herself a capable arts administrator; she was producing much art of her own in these years and by May 1933 she was able to exhibit a large number of her impressionist paintings, woodcuts of San Augustine, and etchings, at the Woman's Club of Charlotte, North Carolina, in May 1933. By 1937 she had become interested in portraiture and studied again with Wayman Adams (1883–1959) and at some point with his teacher Jossey Bilan. She served as president of the San Augustine Art Association in 1947–1948, and was to be president and treasurer of the Florida Association of Art. Her parents were major patrons of the Arts Club and, in fact, assisted the club by selling them land they owned bordering Marine, Charlotte and Cadiz Streets at a below-market price. They then loaned the Arts Club the money to erect a building, essentially designed by Hildegarde Muller-Uri and her father, which was completed in 1954. Muller-Uri's work includes stained glass, etchings, illustrations, woodblock prints and linoleum cuts of city scenes and historic buildings in Florida. In 1955 she was working on a book with twenty-two woodcuts called St. Augustine in Woodcuts. She died in 1990 and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery. Several of her works have been sold at auction, including St. Augustine Street Scene depicting a Black Woman Outside a St. Augustine House (sold 2013).",Normal
"Theodore Thornton Munger (March 5, 1830 - January 11, 1910) was an American Congregational clergyman, theologian and writer. Born on March 5, 1830, in Bainbridge, New York, Munger graduated from Yale University in 1851 and from Yale Divinity School in 1855. He studied under Horace Bushnell at Yale Divinity School. After graduating in 1855, Munger began preaching in Massachusetts. In 1885, he was appointed pastor of the United Church in New Haven, Connecticut. Munger was an advocate of theistic evolution. He argued that ""evolution not only perfects our conception of the unity of God, but... strengthens the argument from design"". However, Munger rejected the concept of survival of the fittest. Munger promoted liberal theology and maintained that revelation was a product of evolution and that there are no a priori scriptural truths. Munger was an early proponent of animal rights. He authored the book The Rights of Dumb Animals, published by the Connecticut Humane Society in 1896. Munger's other publications include: On the Threshold (1880); The Freedom of Faith (1883); Lamps and Paths (1883); The Appeal to Life (1887); Horace Bushnell (1899) and Character Through Inspiration. Munger received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from Illinois College (1883), Harvard University (1904) and Yale University (1908). He died at his home in New Haven on January 11, 1910. Munger is well known for a famous quotation which is usually misattributed to others. In his 1884 book On the Threshold he wrote the following: A purpose is the eternal condition of success. Nothing will take its place. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men of talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is a proverb. Education will not; the country is full of unsuccessful educated men. There is no road to success but through a clear, strong purpose. This is extracted from a larger quote in the book. This shortened version, with the word ""persistence"" replacing the word ""purpose"" is often misattributed to President Calvin Coolidge in 1929. But the true source was Munger.",Normal

"The Edgar hairstyle, otherwise known as the Edgar cut or the Edgar haircut, is a hairstyle that is often associated with Latino culture. In the early 2020s, the haircut gained virality among members of Generation Z and Millennials. The haircut is notably popular in Mexican border states such as Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. The Edgar hairstyle is usually characterized as the front hair having straight fringes, or bangs, along with the sides tapered. The Edgar hairstyle is most prominent among young Latinos. The origin for the name Edgar is unconfirmed, although it is usually attributed to having been named after former Seattle Mariners player Edgar Martínez. The hairstyle is associated with the Mexican Takuache aesthetic, as well as having been found to have similarities to the hairstyles of the Jumano tribe. Another known aspect of the Edgar haircut is the slang word ""cuh"". The Edgar hairstyle has been met with a mixed reception. A professor at the University of Texas at El Paso has praised the hairstyle, calling it ""a really big marker of this generation"", whereas a barber from Corpus Christi, Texas called the hairstyle ""not a favorite amongst parents."". In late 2021, Riverside High School of El Paso, Texas attempted to ban the haircut, claiming the hairstyle ""provokes distraction"".",Normal
"Celia Humphris (26 December 1950–11 January 2021), later known as Celia Drummond, was an English singer and voice artist. She is best known for her position as the lead singer of the folk rock band Trees, a position which she held throughout the band's active years. Humphris was born on 26 December 1950 to Frank Humphris, an illustrator for the Eagle comic series. She attended Arts Educational Schools in Chiswick, where she studied singing, dance and drama. Humphris auditioned for Trees at the request of acoustic guitarist David Costa. Costa specifically wanted her for the band as he knew Humphris as the sister of an acquaintance, and the band did not have a lead vocalist at the time. Humphris was the lead vocalist for both albums produced by the original group: The Garden of Jane Delawney (April 1970) and On the Shore (January 1971). She remained with the band for its second incarnation in 1972 after the original group dissolved, continuing to provide the lead vocals. After Trees, Humphris continued as a singer. After marrying BBC Radio 1 DJ Pete Drummond in August 1972, Humphris co-hosted several radio music shows and later became a regular voice on Capital Radio. Humphris was also a highly sought-after voice artist, providing vocals for a wide variety of environments, including television adverts, radio drama and cartoon characters. Her voice was also known for being widely used at many railway stations across the British railway network, a position which she often shared with voice artist Phil Sayer. She provided guest vocals for several songs on Judy Dyble's Talking With Strangers album in 2009, Dodson and Fogg, a folk-rock project released in 2012, and appeared as a guest vocalist on Galley Beggar's 2017 album Heathen Hymns, released on Rise Above Records. Humphris also hosted a wedding business as a celebrant in Provence, France where she lived for many of her later years. Humphris married BBC Radio 1 DJ Pete Drummond in August 1972, though the couple divorced in 1995. For much of her later life, Humphris lived in Provence. She died on 11 January 2021, at the age of 70.",Normal

"Comparative criminal justice is a subfield of the study of Criminal justice that compares justice systems worldwide. Such study can take a descriptive, historical, or political approach. It studies the similarities and differences in structure, goals, punishment and emphasis on rights as well as the history and political stature of different systems. It is common to broadly categorize the functions of a criminal justice system into policing, adjudication (i.e.: courts), and corrections, although other categorization schemes exist. Comparativists study the four different types of societies, their methods of enforcement and their different types of punishment such as capital punishment, and imprisonment. Within these societies they study different types of legal tradition and analyze the issues they solve and create. They use their information in order to learn effective ways of enforcing laws, and to identify and solve problems that may arise within a system due to its methods. Comparativists in criminal justice study four different kinds of societies: Folk-communal, Urban-commercial, Urban-industrial, and bureaucratic. Folk-communal societies are often seen as primitive and barbaric, they have little specialization among law enforcers, and let many problems go unpunished to avoid over-criminalization however, once tempers “boil over” and the situation becomes a larger issue, harsh and unusual punishment may be administered. Examples are African or Middle Eastern Tribes, or early puritan settlements of America. Urban-commercial societies have few written laws and some specialized enforcement for religious or king’s law enforcement. Punishments are inconsistent and usually harsh. Urban-industrial societies enforce laws that prescribe good behavior and give incentives and disincentives for behavior and police are specialized in property crimes such as theft. Finally, bureaucratic societies are today’s modern society. They feature fully developed laws, lawyers, and police forces trained for multiple types of crime. Different “side effects” of these societies include over-criminalization, overcrowding, and even juvenile delinquency due to the extended age of adolescence these societies bring on. Legal traditions play an important role in the development of international law and justice. Comparativists for criminal justice study these traditions with the intent of finding a way to combine the views of different traditions towards a single view that allows for the successful development of international law. Many comparativists believe that the more states with similar legal views the more likely it is to be able to create international laws that please all. Reichel (2005) identifies four major legal traditions that each have their own respective body of laws: People who study comparative criminal justice study different forms and use of punishment across societies, including capital punishment. Fifty-nine countries retain the death penalty as reported in 2007. Comparativists study the different ways in which execution is carried out across the world including hanging, shooting, beheading, injection, electrocution, and even stoning. Comparativists find that in many developing countries such as Iran, Indonesia, Belarus, and many others, that violent methods of execution such as hanging beheading, shooting, and stoning are much more common ways of carrying out the death penalty, and in many cases the only ways. However in western culture as well as developed countries such as the United States less brutal execution such as lethal injection is utilized. Even prison sentences can come harshly. In many countries such as Burma a person can be sentenced to prison for merely disagreeing with the government. Presumably ridiculous sentences such as multiple life sentences or sentences of hundreds, even thousands of years are meant to prohibit the chance of parole in the future. Although it may seem preposterous, western cultures carry out the same type of sentencing. Even though similar sentences are used across the globe leniency is varied widely between societies. Many governments such as the one mentioned above in Burma provide swift and heavy punishment to assert their roles of power.",Normal
"Sexual stimulation is any stimulus (including bodily contact) that leads to, enhances and maintains sexual arousal, and may lead to orgasm. Although sexual arousal may arise without physical stimulation, achieving orgasm usually requires it. The term sexual stimulation implies stimulation of the genitals, but may also include stimulation of other areas of the body, stimulation of the senses (such as sight, smell, or hearing) and mental stimulation (e.g., reading or fantasizing). Sufficient stimulation of the penis or clitoris usually results in an orgasm. Stimulation can be by self (e.g., masturbation) or by a sexual partner (sexual intercourse or other sexual activity), by use of objects or tools, or by some combination of these methods. Some people practice orgasm control, whereby a person or their partner controls the level of stimulation to prolong the experience leading up to orgasm. Physical sexual stimulation consists of touching the genitals or other erogenous zones. Masturbation, erotic massage, and manual sex are types of physical stimulation involving the genitals. Arousal is triggered through sensitive nerves in these body parts, which cause the release of pleasure-causing chemicals (endorphins) that act as mental rewards to pursue such stimulation. A person may also become aroused by simply touching another person, though the bulbocavernosus reflex itself is triggered by stimulation of the glans penis or clitoris. One study found that women benefit more from pleasurable sex with a committed partner, while gender did not impact the relationship with masturbation. The purpose of sex toys is to provide pleasure and stimulation through an alternative route than just using people's bodies. They can be used by someone on their own, with partnered sex, or group sex. They can be exciting and provide new types of stimulation that the body cannot produce, such as vibrations. Sex toys have been used as a source of sexual stimulation for thousands of years. There have been dildos found from the Palaeolithic era, made of Siltstone and polished to a high gloss. Dildos were also made of camel dung and coated with resin. Historians are uncertain whether these have been used for religious rituals or for personal pleasure. It is known that dildos were used for fertility rituals, however. The ancient Greeks created their dildos from a carved penis covered in leather or animal intestines to create a more natural feel. The Romans created double-ended dildos for use with a partner. Ancient Chinese dildos were made of bronze or other metals and some were hollow allowing them to be filled with liquid to simulate an ejaculation. These were used because wealthy Chinese men would often have too many wives to please. In Persia, it was thought that the blood of the hymen was unclean, and should be avoided by husbands. On the night before a woman's wedding, a local holy man would come and break her hymen with a large stone dildo, a ritual also used to confirm the virginity of the bride. There are many areas through which a person can be sexually stimulated, other than the genitals. The nipples, thighs, lips, and neck can all provide sexual stimulation when touched. This table shows the sex differences in erogenous zones and includes the top ten most arousing areas for both sexes. Each body part was rated out of ten for how arousing it is when touched. Apart from body parts exclusive to one gender such as the penis or clitoris, many of the erogenous zones are similar and contain many nerve endings. The excitation-transfer theory states that existing arousal in the body can be transformed into another type of arousal. For example, sometimes people can be sexually stimulated from residual arousal arising from something such as exercise, being transformed into another type of arousal such as sexual arousal. In one study participants performed some physical exercise and at different stages of recovery had to watch an erotic film and rate how aroused it made them feel. They found that participants who were still experiencing excitatory residues from the exercise rated the film as more arousing than those who had fully recovered from the exercise. This suggests that the remaining arousal from the exercise was being transformed into sexual arousal without any external stimulation. The human sexual response is a dynamic combination of cognitive, emotional, and physiological processes. Whilst the most common forms of sexual stimulation discussed are fantasy or physical stimulation of the genitals and other erogenous areas, sexual arousal may also be mediated through alternative routes such as visual, olfactory and auditory means. Perhaps the most researched non-tactile form of sexual stimulation is visual sexual stimulation. An apparent example is the act of voyeurism– a practice where an individual covertly watches another undress or engage in sexual behaviour. Although seen socio-historically as an unacceptable form of 'sexual deviation', it highlights the human tendency to find sexual stimulation through purely visual routes. The multibillion-dollar porn industry is another example. A common presumption is that men respond more strongly to visual sexual stimuli than do women. This is perhaps best exemplified by the Kinsey hypothesis that men are more prone to sexual arousal from visual stimulation than are women. Nonetheless, both sexes can be sexually aroused through visual stimulation. In one study, visual stimulation was tested by means of an erotic video. Although significantly higher in the male group, sexual arousal was the main emotional reaction reported by both sexes. Their physiological responses to the video also showed characteristics of sexual arousal, such as increased urinary excretions of adrenaline. A subsequent study investigating male arousal showed that men were able to achieve rigid erections through visual stimulation of an erotic film alone. Studies that use visual stimulation as a means for sexual stimulation find that sexual arousal is predominantly correlated with an activation in limbic and paralimbic cortex and in subcortical structures, along with a deactivation in several parts of the temporal cortex. These same areas are activated during physical sexual stimulation, highlighting how powerful visual stimulation can be as a means of sexual arousal. Olfactory information is critical to human sexual behavior. One study investigating olfactory sexual stimulation found that heterosexual men experience sexual arousal in response to a female perfume. Individuals rated odourant stimulation and perceived sexual arousal. They also had functional MRI scans taken during the experiment. The results showed that olfactory stimulation with women's perfume produces activation of specific brain areas associated with sexual arousal in men. Another study found that homosexual men displayed similar hypothalamic activation to that of heterosexual women when smelling a testosterone derivate present in male sweat, suggesting that sexual orientation plays a role in how humans experience olfactory sexual stimulation. Evolutionary analysis of sex differences in reproductive strategies can help explain the importance of smell in sexual arousal due to its link to immunological profile and offspring viability. This is because olfactory cues may be able to trigger an incest avoidance mechanism by reflecting parts of an individual's genetic equipment. In one study, males rated visual and olfactory information as being equally important for selecting a lover, while females considered olfactory information to be the single most important variable in mate choice. Additionally, when considering sexual activity, females singled out body odour from all other sensory experiences as most able to negatively affect desire. Auditory stimulants may also serve to intensify sexual arousal and the experience of pleasure. Making sounds during sexual arousal and sexual activity is widespread among primates and humans. These include sighs, moans, strong expirations and inspirations, increased breathing rate and occasionally, at orgasm, screams of ecstasy. Many of these sounds are highly exciting to people, and act as strong reinforcers of sexual arousal, creating a powerful positive feedback effect. Thus, copulatory vocalisations are likely to serve mutual sexual stimulation for mating partners. Even when not coupled with ""touching"", sounds can be highly sexually arousing. Commercial erotic material (mainly produced for the male market) uses such sounds extensively. As early as the 1920s and 30s, several genres of singers turned to ""low moans"" for erotic effect. Vaudeville Jazz singers often incorporated sex sounds into the narrative of the lyrics. Even contemporary music such as Prince's ""Orgasm"" or Marvin Gaye's ""You Sure Love to Ball"" includes sounds of the female orgasm. Research has shown music to be an auditory sexual stimulant. In one mood induction study, exposure to certain music resulted in significantly greater penile tumescence and subjective sexual arousal for men. In a similar experiment, women did not show significant physiological responses to certain types of music but did report higher levels of sexual arousal. Further studies have looked at the connection between auditory stimulation and the experience of sexual pleasure. Whilst the highest levels of physiological and subjective arousal were found for visual stimuli, spoken-text was found to elicit sexual arousal in men, implicating sounds as a means of sexual stimulation. Phone sex is one type of arousal inducer that makes use of this effect. Sexual arousal includes feelings, attractions and desires, as well as physiological changes. These can be elicited not only by physical but also mental stimulations, such as fantasy, erotic literature, dreams, role-play, and imagination. Sexual fantasy is a form of mental sexual stimulation which many people engage in. It is where a person imagines a sexual experience while they are awake. Fantasy has less social or safety limits than in real life situations. It gives people more freedom to experiment or think of things they could not necessarily try in real life and can be anything from imagining your spouse naked, to imagining a sexual experience with a mythical creature. Common sexual fantasies include imagining activities with a loved partner, reliving past experiences and experiences with multiple partners of the opposite gender. It is also common to have fantasies about things you would not do in real life and about taboo or illegal activities, such as forcing another, or being forced by another to have sex, intercourse with a stranger and sex with a boy or girl or older partner. It is useful for research because it makes differences between male and female heterosexual preferences clearer than studies of behaviour. Many sexual fantasies are shared between men and women, possibly because of cultural influence. However, there are still gender differences that have been found. Men are more likely than women to imagine being in a dominant or active role, whereas women are more likely to imagine themselves as passive participants. Women's fantasies have significantly more affection and commitment, whereas men are more likely to fantasise using visual imagery and explicit detail. One explanation of this difference comes from the evolutionary perspective. Women have a higher minimum parental investment than males (they have 9 months of gestation prior birth and are then the main care givers, whereas men only have to provide sperm to ensure their genes are passed on) and are therefore more likely to want commitment from their partner in order to gain resources to improve their offspring's chance of survival. Fantasies can have benefits, such as increasing arousal more than other forms of sexual stimuli (such as an erotic story) and increasing sexual desire. Individuals who disclose their sexual fantasies to their partners also have a higher sexual satisfaction. However, whether people are willing to open up to their partner generally depends on the content of such fantasies. A more negative effect of sexual fantasy is that it has been linked with sexual crimes, and indeed sexual offenders often report that they have had fantasies related to their offense. However, such fantasies are also common among those who have not been involved in such criminal acts and non-offenders do not use their fantasies to guide their behaviour. Therefore, fantasy alone cannot be used as a sign that someone will become an offender. Nocturnal emission orgasms or ""wet dreams"" or ""erotic dreams"" are when people ejaculate or orgasm during sleep. These occur during REM (rapid eye movement) phases of sleep, which is the main stage when humans dream. This implies that erotic dreams alone are enough to stimulate men, but erections accompany all REM phases. According to self-report data, as many as 22% of young women may also experience orgasm during sleep, with such dreams being more common in college students in higher school years than younger students. The orgasms experienced were positively correlated with high emotionality, including sexual excitement, but also anxiety. Sexual role-play is when people act out characters or scenarios which may sexually stimulate each other. This can include fantasies (discussed above) and fetishes, such as BDSM (bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, sadism and masochism) or age-play. It has been described by some as an adult form of L.A.R.P (live action role-play). Role-play can also be carried out online, by typing stories to each other or pretending to be a character, and is therefore a form of mental stimulation you can engage in with another person without them being physically present. Many adolescents find online role-play pleasurable and arousing. Role-play can also include sexual fan fiction, where characters from well-known stories, that were not sexually or romantically together in the original story, are written into sexual scenes. Slash fiction is a type of fan fiction where the characters of the same sex (originally male-male) engage in romantic or sexual activities. Slash fiction allows people the freedom to share stimulating things that can be counter-cultural. According to the National Library of Medicine, approximately 80% of middle aged women with heart failure have reported a decrease in vaginal lubrication, leading to challenges in successful intercourse. The reduction in lubrication affects the vaginal moisture during sexual activity. Women with hypoactive sexual desire (HSDD) may also experience a lack of interest in sexual stimuli, thus affecting their psychological responses to sexual cues. Within the study conducted by Sandra Garcia and her colleagues, suggested that trauma-related changes may impact genital tissues, affecting blood flow and response to sexual stimulation. As well as when psychologic distress is present it affects the ability to achieve orgasm despite adequate sexual stimulation. This is a result of relationship issues that affect sexual stimulation and sexual response, connecting back to orgasmic difficulties. The deficiency of estrogen leads to conditions like dyspareunia, which is something important for maintaining adequate lubrication. Therefore there is hormonal treatment that is used which is the addition of in-taking estrogen supplements. But as well as the supplementation of testosterone, which was shown as beneficial for enhancing desire, arousal, and sexual satisfaction. There could also be some hormonal changes when it comes to going through the phases of aging. A review in 'The Journal of Sexual Medicine', showed how pre-menopause women showed more sexual dissatisfaction. This was shown due to their hormonal imbalances. When sexual stimulation is perceived, there are systems in the brain that receive the stimuli and respond to it. During physiological sexual arousal, the autonomic nervous system responds to signals from central nervous system and prepares the body for sexual activity. The autonomic nervous system engages the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems, which are responsible for blood flow to genital and erectile tissues, and to muscles that participate in sexual responses. This results in responses like increased breathing rate, heart rate, and pupil dilation. The limbic system also plays a part in how sexual stimuli are received. A study done about pleasure and brain activity in men showed that electrical stimulation of the limbic system is highly pleasurable, and can sometimes generate orgasmic responses. During genital stimulation different areas of the brain are activated in men and women. For men, a study saw that genital stimulation caused part of the cerebral cortex and the insula, which is a part of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, to activate. For women, during clitoral stimulation parts of the secondary somatosensory cortex were activated. In both men and women the amygdala was deactivated.",Normal

"Sir Tejinder Singh Virdee, FRS (Punjabi: ਤਜਿੰਦਰ ਸਿੰਘ ਵਿਰਦੀ, born 13 October 1952), is a Kenyan-born British experimental particle physicist and Professor of Physics at Imperial College London. He is best known for originating the concept of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) with a few other colleagues and has been referred to as one of the 'founding fathers'  of the project. CMS is a world-wide collaboration which started in 1991 and now has over 3500 participants from 45 countries. Virdee was elected Fellow of the Royal Society and of the Institute of Physics (IOP) in 2012. In recognition of his work on CMS he has been awarded the IOP High Energy Particle Physics group prize (2007) and the IOP Chadwick Medal and Prize (2009). In 2012, he was awarded the 2013 Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for 'leadership in the scientific endeavour that led to the discovery of the new Higgs-like particle by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) along with 6 other physicists. He was awarded the 2013 European Physical Society High Energy and Particle Physics Prize and the 2017 American Physical Society Panofsky Prize for his pioneering work and outstanding leadership in the making of the CMS experiment. In 2020 he was awarded the Blaise Pascal Medal of the European Academy of Sciences in Physics. He was also on the Physical Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize in 2020. In 2014, Virdee was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours list for services to science. Tejinder Virdee was born in 1952 to Sikh parents Udham Kaur and Chain Singh Virdee in Nyeri, Kenya. Virdee went to school in Kisumu at the Kisumu Boys High School. Due to the prevailing circumstances in Kenya at the time, his family (of Indian Sikh origin) emigrated in 1967 to Birmingham, England. He credits part of his interest in physics to Howard Stockley, his physics teacher at King's Norton Boys' School, Birmingham, whom he describes as an 'inspirational teacher'. He also remembers visiting Birmingham Museum of Science and Industry, where he stumbled across a cloud chamber sparking his interest in the study of the structure of matter. Virdee obtained a B.Sc. in Physics from Queen Mary College, University of London in 1974. After completing his Ph.D. at Imperial College London, on an experiment conducted at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in California, he joined CERN in 1979 as a Fellow of the Experimental Physics Division. Virdee’s early scientific career (1979-1984) involved verifying the strange notion that the “quarks” (the constituents of the protons the neutrons and all other hadrons) carry fractional electric charge. This was successfully demonstrated by the NA14 photoproduction experiment at CERN in the mid-eighties. Following NA14 he joined the UA1 experiment at CERN's proton-antiproton collider (SPS) where his interest in high-performance calorimetry was developed, leading to his invention of a novel technique of collecting light in plastic scintillator-based calorimeters. Towards the end of UA1, (1990) Virdee, with a few other colleagues, started planning an experiment based on a high field solenoid that would be able to identify the missing elements of the Standard Model (SM) and also to probe in full the physics of the TeV scale. This was to become the CMS experiment at the LHC, one of the most complex instruments science has ever seen. Since 1991 Virdee has played a crucial role in all phases of CMS. Over the last two decades this has covered conceptual design, intensive R&D, prototyping, construction, installation, commissioning, data-taking and finally physics exploitation. He has been the driving force behind many of the major technology decisions made in CMS, especially the selection of the calorimeter technologies. The CMS hadron calorimeter uses the technique he had invented earlier. The possibility of discovering a Higgs-like boson played a crucial role in the conceptual design of CMS, and served as a benchmark to test the performance of the experiment. In 1990 Virdee and a colleague, Christopher Seez, carried out the first detailed simulation studies of the most plausible way to detect the SM Higgs boson in the low-mass region in the environment of the LHC: via its decay into two photons. Understanding that dense scintillating crystals offer arguably the best possibility of achieving excellent energy resolution, Virdee made a compelling case for the use of lead tungstate scintillating crystals (PbWO4) for the electromagnetic calorimeter of CMS and then led the team that proved the viability of this technique, a technique that has played a crucial role in the discovery of the new heavy boson, in July 2012. Virdee was deeply involved in this search for the Higgs boson, especially via its two-photon decay mode. Virdee was the deputy project leader of CMS between 1993 and 2006 and was then elected project leader (Spokesperson) in January 2007 for a period of three years. He oversaw the final stages of construction, installation and data taking with the first collisions at the LHC. Virdee is a major voice in arguing for the long-term future of the LHC accelerator and its experiments. An increase in the interaction rate by almost a factor of around ten is being advocated for the CMS and ATLAS experiments. To benefit fully from this luminosity increase the CMS detector will be upgraded. Virdee is leading efforts to replace the detector's endcaps with a novel silicon-based technology that measures the energy and momentum of particles to unprecedented levels of precision. Beyond his contributions to particle physics he is a promoter of science and education, especially in Africa. He funds science-related education activities in schools and universities in Africa, India and the United Kingdom. Virdee has given several keynote speeches at international conferences, opening or closing addresses at particle physics conferences and public lectures on the LHC Project. These include the 2007 Schrödinger Lecture, the 2012 Peter Lindsay Lectures at Imperial College, the 16th Kaczmarczik Lecture at Drexel University, Philadelphia in 2011, the Keynote Speech at the 2009 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, Reno, USA and joint lectures on the LHC Project with Prof. Edward Witten in Philadelphia, U.S.A. (2008) and Split, Croatia (2009). Amongst his interviews are a dialogue with A. C. Grayling, and an interview with Jim Al-Khalili on the BBC Radio 4 programme “The Life Scientific”.

"Seth-Peribsen (also known as Ash-Peribsen, Peribsen and Perabsen) is the serekh name of an early Egyptian monarch (pharaoh), who ruled during the Second Dynasty of Egypt (c. 2890 – c. 2686 BC). His chronological position within this dynasty is unknown and it is disputed who ruled both before and after him. The duration of his reign is also unknown. Peribsen's name is unusual, in that Set, not Horus, was his patron deity. This goes against the Egyptian tradition of a king choosing the falcon-shaped deity Horus as his royal patron. Peribsen's tomb was discovered in 1898 at Abydos. It was well preserved and showed traces of restoration undertaken during later dynastic periods. The serekh for Peribsen was found pressed in earthen jar seals made of clay and mud and in inscriptions on alabaster, sandstone, porphyry and black schist vessels. These seals and vessels were excavated from Peribsen's tomb and at an excavation site in Elephantine. One clay seal with Peribsen's name was found inside the mastaba tomb K1 at Beit Khallaf. Two large tomb stelae made of granite were found at his burial site. Their shape is unusual and they appear unfinished and rough. Egyptologists suspect that this was done deliberately, but the reasons are unknown. A cylinder seal of unknown provenance shows Peribsen's name inside a cartouche and gives the epithet Merj-netjeru (""beloved of the gods""). This arrangement leads Egyptologists and archaeologists to the conclusion that the seal must have been created later, in memoriam, because the use of royal cartouches began long after Peribsen's reign. Another seal of the same material shows Peribsen's name without a cartouche, but with the royal title Nisut-Bity (""king of Upper- and Lower Egypt"") instead. Existing skeptical views about Peribsen's existence are based on New Kingdom Ramesside king lists, such as the Abydos King List, the Saqqara King List and the Royal Canon of Turin, which all omit Peribsen's name. These, however, are known to have been created nearly 1,500 years after his death and several Fourth Dynasty tombs of priests performing the funerary cult for Peribsen have been uncovered. These tombs report Peribsen's name correctly and their existence demonstrates that Peribsen was seen as a legitimate pharaoh, not subject to damnatio memoriae as Akhenaten later would be. Historians and Egyptologists therefore consider the possibility that Peribsen's name was actually forgotten over time or that his name was preserved in a distorted, misspelled form. Peribsen's royal name is a subject of curiosity for Egyptologists because it is connected to the deity Seth rather than Horus, as was traditional for the name of a pharaoh. Traditionally, the Horus name of the king was written within a serekh: the image of the facade of the royal palace beneath a falcon representing the god Horus (see Egyptian hieroglyphs). Instead, Peribsen chose to have the Set animal, representing Seth, on his serekh. Although Peribsen is the only known pharaoh to have the Set animal preside alone over his serekh, he is not the only king to associate himself with Seth. Examples include the 13th Dynasty pharaoh Seth Meribre, the 19th Dynasty rulers Seti I and Seti II and the 20th Dynasty king Setnakhte. The debate continues over why Peribsen chose this name. Earlier theories favoured the idea that Egypt was split into two realms during Peribsen's time or that he was a heretic who sought to start a new monotheistic religion with Seth as the only worshipped god. However, newer evidence and evaluations tend to show that the Egyptian kingdom was unified, but witnessed a vast and profound reform during the Second Dynasty. Seal impressions from tombs of this era reveal great changes in the titles held by high officials, pointing to a reduction of their power. Further seal impressions show that several deities were worshipped under Peribsen, refuting the monotheism theory. Other contemporary inscriptions indicate that Egyptian grammar was perfected during his time: In particular, the earliest seal impressions with complete sentences date back to Peribsen's reign. Thus, Peribsen's reign was in fact a time of cultural and religious advancement. Peribsen's choice of patron, and his rule during the shadowy period of the mid-Second Dynasty, have led Egyptologists and historians to search for possible explanations for both his name and the troubled times he lived in. The following sections discuss some of the theories that they have put forth. A theory that was popular until the mid-20th century, supported by Egyptologists Percy Newberry, Jaroslav Černý, Walter Bryan Emery and Bernhard Grdseloff held that Peribsen was a heretic who sought to introduce a new, monotheistic state religion to Egypt, with Seth as the only worshipped god. Peribsen's actions were thought to be similar to those of the much later 18th Dynasty pharaoh Akhenaten, who had required Egyptians to serve only the Aten. Newberry proposed that the priests of Horus and Seth fought each other ""in the manner of a War of the Roses"" during the second half of the Second Dynasty. The ""heretic Peribsen"" theory was based on three observations: that the name ""Peribsen"" was excluded from later king lists, that the king's tomb had been destroyed and plundered during antiquity and, finally, that the tomb stelae of Peribsen, that once displayed the Set animal, were badly scratched with the clear intention of effacing the Seth image. Egyptologists hypothesized these were the actions of religious opponents to the Sethian priest-caste. Lauer and Firth relied on the ""heretic Peribsen"" theory to explain the enormous quantity of stone vessels inscribed with the name of First and Second Dynasty kings found beneath Djoser's pyramid in bags bearing seals of Khasekhemwy and Djoser. They proposed that Peribsen had plundered the tombs of his predecessors, followers of Horus, and scattered their funerary equipment. These vessels were gathered in the royal treasury during Khasekhemwy's reign following his reunification of Egypt, and finally put beneath the Step Pyramid by Djoser, in an act of pious devotion. Today this theory, as well as Lauer and Firth's conclusions, is widely questioned. Archaeological evidence of Peribsen has been found almost entirely in Upper Egypt. In particular, his name does not appear in Lower Egyptian records surviving from that time. It is argued that Peribsen may not have ruled over all of Egypt and therefore did not have the authority to force a change in state religion. Another piece of evidence that argues against the ""heretic Peribsen"" theory is the false door of the priest Shery at Saqqara. Shery held office during the early Fourth Dynasty. The inscription on the false door connects the name of Peribsen in one sentence with another shadowy king of the Second Dynasty, Senedj. According to the addendum, Shery was ""overseer of all wab-priests of king Peribsen in the necropolis of king Senedj, in his mortuary temple and at all other places"". This implies that the funerary cult of Peribsen continued at least until the Fourth Dynasty, inconsistent with the assumption that Peribsen's name was not allowed to be mentioned. Additionally, Egyptologists such as Herman te Velde point out that Shery was not the only Fourth Dynasty priest participating in the funerary cult of Peribsen. Inkef, possibly a brother or cousin of Shery, also held the title of a ""supervisor of Ka-priests of Peribsen"". Seal impressions found in Peribsen's tomb at Abydos show several deities: Ash, Min and Bastet, suggesting they were venerated during Peribsen's time on the throne. This finding argues against Peribsen worshipping a single god, or promoting monotheism. The heretic theory of Newberry, Černý, Grdseloff and others was devised from the very limited archaeological information available during their lifetimes. Most of the clay seal impressions found were still undeciphered and untranslated in their time. In the opinion of Sainte Fare Garnot (1956) and te Velde (1956), the name of ""Peribsen"" accords religious meaning, even before association with a deity. The name ""Peribsen"" literally means ""He who comes forth by their will"" or ""His heart and will comes forth for them."" The Egyptian syllable sn means ""them, their, those"", revealing a clear plural writing. Te Velde and Garnot are convinced that Peribsen used the heraldic Seth animal as a serekh patron, but also linked his name to Horus. If true, it would prove that Peribsen worshipped Horus and Seth on an equal footing during his lifetime. An ostentatious plural meaning with religious ambiguity was not uncommon for pharaohs' names in the early Egyptian dynasties. Peribsen may have been perceived as a living incarnation of both Horus and Seth in equal measure, just like his predecessors on the throne. Therefore, Peribsen's name may actually show no break in the sacred tradition; he added the power of Seth to Horus. As further examples, the titles of early dynastic queens used plural patron deities, such as ""she who is allowed to see Horus and Seth"" and ""she who carries Horus and Seth"". Similarly, the unusual serekh of king Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the Second Dynasty, shows the deities Horus and Seth together atop the serekh. Horus wears the White Crown of Upper Egypt and Seth wears the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. The two gods are depicted facing each other in a kissing gesture. This special name was meant to illustrate the dual incarnation of the king as the representative of Horus and Seth, with power over all Egypt. Khasekhemwy's name can be interpreted as an advanced form of Peribsen's serekh name. Egyptologists Ludwig David Morenz and Wolfgang Helck remark that the targeted gouging of Seth-animals did not occur until the New Kingdom of Egypt. The erasure of the Seth chimera on Peribsen's tomb stelae had been attributed to activity shortly after his death under the ""heretic"" theory; new discoveries suggested the defamation occurred centuries later. Historian Dietrich Wildung states that the necropolis of Abydos was not the only one plundered in antiquity: the tombs at Saqqara and Giza were also ransacked. Thus, he concludes that any targeted action against one particular pharaoh can be excluded. The earlier theories of Newberry, Černý and Grdseloff said that the Egyptian state under Peribsen suffered from several civil wars, either economic or political in origin. If he was held responsible for the putative misery in the past, this could explain why later king lists excluded Peribsen. In contrast, more recent theories now hold that, if the Egyptian kingdom was divided, the division happened peacefully. Egyptologists such as Michael Rice, Francesco Tiradritti and Wolfgang Helck point to the once palatial and well preserved mastaba tombs at Saqqara and Abydos belonging to high officials such as Ruaben and Nefer-Setekh. These are all dated from the reign of Nynetjer to that of Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the Second Dynasty. Egyptologists consider the archaeological record of the mastabas' condition and the original architecture as proof that the statewide mortuary cults for kings and noblemen operated successfully during the entire dynasty. If true, their preservation is inconsistent with the theory of civil wars and economic problems during Peribsen's reign. Rice, Tiradritti and Helck think that Nynetjer decided to leave a divided realm because of private or political reasons and that the split was a formality sustained by Second Dynasty kings. The origin of the political division is unknown. It might have happened at the beginning of Peribsen's rule or shortly before. Because Peribsen chose the deity Seth as his new throne patron, Egyptologists are of the view that Peribsen was a chieftain from Thinis or a prince of the Thinite royal house. This theory is based on Seth being a deity of Thinite origin, which would explain Peribsen's choice: his name changing may have been nothing more than smart political (and religious) propaganda. Peribsen is thought to have gained the Thinite throne and ruled only Upper Egypt, whilst other rulers held the Memphite throne and ruled Lower Egypt. Egyptologists Walter Bryan Emery, Kathryn A. Bard and Flinders Petrie believe that Peribsen was also known as Sekhemib-Perenmaat, another Second Dynasty ruler that had connected his name with the falcon god Horus. As evidence, clay seals of Sekhemib found in the entrance of Peribsen's tomb support this hypothesis. Sekhemib's tomb has not yet been found. This theory is debatable; Hermann Alexander Schlögl, Wolfgang Helck, Peter Kaplony and Jochem Kahl argue that the clay seals were only found at the entrance area of Peribsen's tomb and none of them depict Peribsen and Sekhemib's names together in one inscription. Furthermore, they remark that it was customary for a pharaoh to bury his predecessor and seal his tomb; the presence of Sekhemib's seals shows the line of dynastic inheritance. Similar inferences can be drawn from the ivory tablets of king Hotepsekhemwy found at the entrance of king Qa'a's tomb and the clay seals of Djoser found at the entrance of Khasekhemwy's tomb. Schlögl, Helck, Kaplony and Kahl are convinced that the discovery of Sekhemib's seals support the view that Sekhemib immediately succeeded Peribsen and buried him. Scholars Toby Wilkinson and Helck believe that Peribsen and Sekhemib could have been related. Their theory is based on the stone vessel inscriptions and seal impressions that show strong similarities in their typography and grammar. The vessels of Peribsen show the notation ""ini-setjet"" (""tribute of the people of Sethroë""), whilst Sekhemib's inscriptions have the notation ""ini-khasut"" (""tribute of the desert nomads""). A further indication that Peribsen and Sekhemib were related is their serekh names; they both used the syllables ""Per"" and ""ib"" in their names. The false door inscription of Shery might indicate that Peribsen is identical with king Senedj (""Senedj"" means ""the frightening"") and that this name was used in the king lists by proxy, as the Seth name was forbidden to mention. In contrast, Dietrich Wildung and Wolfgang Helck identify Peribsen with the Ramesside cartouche name Wadjenes. They think it is possible that the name Per-ib-sen was misread from a sloppy hieratic inscription of Wadj-sen. As some archaeological records support the view that the Egyptian state was divided during Peribsen's reign, there is continued debate as to why his predecessors decided to divide the realm, and whether Peribsen ruled part or all of Egypt. Egyptologists Wolfgang Helck, Nicolas Grimal, Hermann Alexander Schlögl and Francesco Tiradritti believe that king Nynetjer, the third ruler of the Second dynasty and predecessor to Peribsen, ruled an Egypt that was suffering from an overly complex state administration. Nynetjer decided to split Egypt to leave it to two chosen successors who would rule two separate kingdoms, in the hope that the state administration could improve. Archaeological evidence, such as the imprinted clay seals and inscribed jars, appear to support the claim that Peribsen ruled only in Upper Egypt. A great number of these were found in Abydos, Naqada and at Elephantine, with only a single clay seal bearing his name found in Lower Egypt, at Beit Khallaf. Historians think Peribsen's realm would have extended from Naqada to the Isle of Elephantine. The rest of Egypt would therefore have been controlled by a different, coexisting ruler. Egyptologist Dimitri B. Proussakov supports his theory with notations on the famous Palermo stone concerning the year events of king Nynetjer. From the twelfth year event onward, ""The king of Upper- and Lower Egypt appears"" was amended to ""The king of Lower Egypt appears"". Proussakov sees this as a strong indication that Nynetjer's power over Egypt had diminished. Egyptologists compare the situation to that of king Qa'a, one of the last rulers of the First Dynasty. When Qa'a died, obscure claimants appeared and battled for the throne of Egypt. The struggles reached an apex with the plundering of the royal cemetery at Abydos, whereupon the cemetery was abandoned and Saqqara became the new royal burial site. The conflict was ended by the ascension of king Hotepsekhemwy, the founder of the Second Dynasty. Barbara Bell, another scholar, believes that an economic catastrophe such as a famine or a long-lasting drought affected Egypt. To better address the problem of feeding the Egyptian population, Nynetjer split the realm into two and his successors founded two independent realms, perhaps with intent to reunite after the famine. Bell points to the inscriptions of the Palermo stone, where, in her opinion, the records of the annual Nile floods show constantly low levels during this period. Bell's theory is refuted today by Egyptologists such as Stephan Seidlmayer, who asserts her calculations were incorrect. Seidlmayer has shown that the annual Nile floods were at usual levels at Nynetjer's time up to the period of the Old Kingdom. Bell overlooked that the heights of the Nile floods in the Palermo stone inscription take into account the measurements of the nilometers around Memphis, but not elsewhere along the river. A state-wide drought was unlikely. Egyptian historians such as Helck, Tiradritti, Schlögl, Emery and Grimal are convinced that Peribsen was a co-ruler. The investigation into the rulers of Lower Egypt is ongoing. The Rammesside king lists differ in their order of royal names from king Senedj onward. The royal table of Sakkara and the royal canon of Turin reflect Memphite traditions, which only allowed Memphite rulers to be mentioned. The Abydos king list reflects instead the Thinite traditions and therefore only Thinite rulers appear on that list. Until king Senedj, all the king lists are in agreement. After him, the Sakkara list and the Turin list mention three kings as successors: Neferkara I, Neferkasokar and Hudjefa I. The Abydos king list jumps forward to Khasekhemwy, calling him ""Djadjay"". The discrepancies are considered by Egyptologists to be the result of the division of Egypt during the Second dynasty. Additional contradictory findings are the Horus and Nebty names of kings discovered in the Great Southern Gallery in the necropolis of the (Third dynasty) king Djoser at Sakkara. Stone vessel inscriptions mention the kings Nubnefer, Weneg-Nebty, Horus Ba, Horus ""Bird"" and Za; each of these is mentioned only a few times, suggesting their reigns were short. King Sneferka might be identical with king Qa'a or an ephemeral successor of his. King Weneg-Nebty might be identical with the Ramesside cartouche name Wadjenes. But kings such as ""Nubnefer"", ""Bird"" and ""Za"" remain a mystery. They never appear anywhere else and the number of objects surviving from their lifetimes is very limited. Schlögl, Helck and Peter Kaplony postulate, that Nubnefer, Za and Bird were contemporaries of Peribsen and Sekhemib and ruled over Lower Egypt, whilst the latter two ruled Upper Egypt. Scholars such as Herman TeVelde, I. E. S. Edwards and Toby Wilkinson believe the inscription of the famous Annal stone of Fifth dynasty, a black olivin-basalt slabstone displaying a very detailed king list, argues against the division of the realm. On the stone the kings from 1st to 7th dynasty are listed by their Horus name, their gold name and their cartouche name, their name banderoles end with the name of their royal mother. The lists also contain rectangular windows presenting year events from the day of king's coronation up to his death. The most famous fragments of the Annal stone are called Palermo Stone and Cairo Stone. On the Cairo stone, in line IV, the nine last years of king Nynetjer are preserved (but most of the year windows are illegible now). The date of Nynetjer's death is followed by a new king. Recent investigations reveal that the serekh of that new king is surmounted by a four-legged animal, not by the Horus-falcon. Since the only four-legged heraldic serekh animal in early Egypt was the chimera of the god Seth, despite passionate disagreement, the indicated ruler is likely to be Peribsen. Egyptologists such as TeVelde, Barta and Edwards do not agree; Peribsen might have not been the only king with a Seth-name. The year events under Nynetjer show increasing references to Seth, suggesting the tradition of a Horus name as the sole name of kings might have already evolved. The rise of a king allied with Seth was thus unsurprising. TeVelde, Barta and Edwards think that, in addition to Peribsen, the rulers Wadjenes, Nubnefer or Sened might have been Seth-kings as well; one of them surely was the true direct successor of Nynetjer. The comparatively large amount of archaeological finds from Peribsen's reign contradict the brief estimated length of rulership, only 10 to 12 years, as presented on the Annal stone. The Annal stone gives absolutely no indication of a division of the Egyptian realm. Barta, TeVelde, Wilkinson and Edwards argue that the theory of state division is untenable. An administrative reorganization or split in the priesthood sects is more likely. During his time on the throne, Peribsen founded an administrative center called ""The white house of treasury"" as well as a new royal residence, called the ""protection of Nubt"", located near Ombos (""Nubt"" being the Ancient Egyptian name of Naqada). The administrative titles of scribes, seal-bearers and overseers were adjusted to correspond to the divided bureaucratic state administration. For example, titles like ""sealer of the king"" were changed into ""sealer of the king of Upper Egypt"". This bureaucratic reform may indicate an attempt by Peribsen to limit the power of these officials, further evidence for a bloated and unwieldy state administration under Nynetjer. The administration system under Peribsen and Sekhemib had a clear and well-defined hierarchy; as an example, from highest to the lowest rank: Treasury house (royal and therefore highest in ranking) → pension office → property → vineyards → private vineyard (property of citizens and therefore lowest in ranking). King Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the Second dynasty, was able to re-unify the state administration of Egypt and therefore unite the whole of Ancient Egypt. He brought the two treasury houses of Egypt under the control of the ""House of the King"", bringing them into a new, single administration centre. Peribsen also founded royal edifices such as Per-nubt (""house of Ombos"") and Per-Medjed (""house of meetings"") and created several cities of economic importance. Their names, Afnut (""city of the headdress-makers""), Nebj (""protector's city""), Abet-desheret (""city of the red granite jars"") and Huj-setjet (""city of the Asians'), are mentioned on numerous clay seals alongside Peribsen's serekh, often preceded by the phrase ""visit of the king at..."". Inscriptions on stone vessels also mention an ""ini-setjet"" (""tribute of the people of Sethroë""), which might indicate that Peribsen founded a cult centre for the deity Seth in the Nile Delta. This may suggest Peribsen ruled over the whole of Egypt, or, at least, that he was accepted as king across all of Egypt. One official from Peribsen's reign, Nefer-Setekh (""Seth is beautiful""), the ""wab-priest of the king"", is known to Egyptologists by his stela. His name may highlight the appearance and popularity of Seth as a royal deity. In Peribsen's tomb at Abydos, clay seals were found that demonstrate the first complete written sentence in recorded Egyptian history. The inscription reads: ""The golden oneHe of Ombos hath unifiedhanded over the two realms forto his son, the king of Lower and Upper Egypt, Peribsen"". The title ""The golden one"", also read as ""He of Ombos"", is considered by Egyptologists to be a religious form of address to the deity Seth. Despite his alignment with Seth, numerous deities were worshipped by the populace under Peribsen. Numerous clay seal impressions and jar inscriptions mention the gods Ash, Horus, Nekhbet, Min, Bastet and Kherty. The depictions of the deities are followed by the name of the place or town where they had their principal cult center. On the Cairo stone, a statue of Ash and a fetish of Seth are credited to Peribsen, complementing the clay seal impressions. Curiously, several seal impressions show a sun disc over the Seth chimera atop the royal serekh: the ancient symbol for the god Ra. There is no archaeologic proof that the sun god Ra was part of the Egyptian pantheon at this early date; the appearance of the disc may be the first evidence of the evolving sun cult and theistic change. The sun disc appears in connection to one of the state patrons (for example, under Peribsen's predecessor Raneb the sun was connected to Horus); under Peribsen it was connected to Seth. Under king Khasekhemwy the sun finally received its own name (ra) and, at the time of throne change between Khasekhemwy and his follower Djoser, several priests and officials also connected their name to Ra. Peribsen was buried in the tomb P of the royal cemetery at Umm el-Qa'ab near Abydos. The first excavation of the tomb started in 1898 under the supervision of French archaeologist and Egyptologist Émile Amélineau. This first foray was followed by excavations in 1901 and 1902 under the supervision of British archaeologist Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie. Further exploration of the tomb was undertaken in 1928 by the Swiss Egyptologist Edouard Naville. The tomb's construction is straightforward and, compared to the size of other royal tombs in the same area, surprisingly small. The design model was the tomb of king Djer (third pharaoh of the First dynasty), thought to be the 'Tomb of Osiris' from the Middle Kingdom. The architecture of Peribsen's tomb is similar to the residential palace. The tomb measures 16 metres (52ft) x 13 metres (43ft) and comprises three independent structures nested into one another: in the center is the main burial chamber, measuring 7.3 metres (24ft) x 2.9 metres (9.5ft), and which is made of mud bricks, reeds, and wood. On the north, east and west sides the burial chamber is surrounded by nine small storage rooms leading into one another; on the south face is a long antechamber. A passageway runs between the inner structures and the outer wall. Excavations under the supervision of the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut Kairo (DAIK) in 2001 and 2004 revealed that the tomb had been erected and completed in a great hurry. The building works took place in a single phase; the walls were plastered roughly; and the monument had collapsed several times over the centuries. During the Middle Kingdom, Peribsen's tomb was restored at least twice together with the tomb of Djer, which was thought to be that of Osiris. The tomb had been extensively plundered by tomb robbers during antiquity, yet numerous stone vessels and earthen jars remained. Some of the stone vessels had copper-coated rims and are similar to the better known finds from tomb of Khasekhemwy. Vessels from preceding rulers such as Nynetjer and Raneb were also found. Beads and bracelets made of fayence and carnelian and tools made of copper were excavated. Special findings include a silver needle engraved with the name of king Hor Aha and clay seal fragments with the name of king Sekhemib. The two stone stelae from the entrance, common to burial chambers of the First and Second dynasties, are now on display in two different museums. A royal funerary enclosure made of mud bricks was found close to Peribsen's tomb. Clay seals with Peribsen's serekh name on them were located near the eastern entrance and inside a destroyed offering shrine. The findings support the view that the building was part of Peribsen's burial site. The funerary enclosure is commonly known as ""Middle Fort"". This was first discovered in 1904 under the supervision of Canadian archaeologist Charles Trick Currelly and British Egyptologist Edward Russell Ayrton. The enclosure wall was located on the north-west side of Khasekhemwy's funerary enclosure ""Shunet El Zebib"" (""raisin barn""). Peribsen's measures 108 metres (354ft) x 55 metres (180ft) and housed only a few cult buildings. The enclosure has three entrances: one to the east, one to the south and one to the north. A small shrine, measuring 12.3 metres (40ft) x 9.75 metres (32.0ft) was located at the south-east corner of the funerary enclosure. It once comprised three small chapels. No subsidiary tombs were found. The tradition of burying the family and court of the king when he died was abandoned at the time of Qa'a, one of the last rulers of the First dynasty.",Normal
"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit is a comic novel by P. G. Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom on 15 October 1954 by Herbert Jenkins, London and in the United States on 23 February 1955 by Simon & Schuster, Inc., New York, under the title Bertie Wooster Sees It Through. It is the seventh novel featuring Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves. The novel takes place at Brinkley Court, the home of Bertie's Aunt Dahlia, who is intent on selling her weekly magazine, Milady's Boudoir. Florence Craye and G. D'Arcy ""Stilton"" Cheesewright are major characters in the story. Bertie has grown a moustache, which Jeeves disapproves of. G. D'Arcy ""Stilton"" Cheesewright, a fellow member at the Drones Club who has drawn Bertie's name in the annual club darts sweep, becomes jealous when Cheesewright’s fiancée Florence Craye says she loves Bertie's moustache. Florence and Bertie were engaged in the past, and Stilton mistakenly believes Bertie still loves her. Stilton is also jealous of Percy Gorringe, a playwright dramatizing Florence's novel Spindrift. Disappointed with Stilton after he refuses to grow a moustache, Florence asks Bertie to take her to a night club for research for her next novel. Hoping to talk her into returning to Stilton, Bertie agrees. However, the night club is raided. When Florence tries to run away, Bertie trips a policeman chasing her. Florence escapes and Bertie spends the night in jail before paying a fine of ten pounds. Shortly afterward, Florence and Stilton reconcile when Stilton agrees to grow a moustache. At her home of Brinkley Court, Aunt Dahlia, Bertie's aunt who runs a magazine called Milady's Boudoir, is trying to sell the paper to the Liverpudlian newspaper magnate Mr. Trotter, who brought along his wife Mrs. Trotter and his stepson, Percy Gorringe. Aunt Dahlia has hired the successful novelist Daphne Dolores Morehead, who is staying at Brinkley, to write a serial for Milady's Boudoir, to make the magazine appear successful to Mr. Trotter. Aunt Dahlia is also trying to win over Mr. Trotter with the magnificent cooking of her French chef, Anatole, though this does not seem to be working. Florence has also gone to Brinkley Court. Aunt Dahlia tells Bertie to come to Brinkley to cheer up Percy, who is in love with Florence and upset that she is with Stilton. Stilton discovers that Florence and Bertie went to a night club together, and breaks his engagement to her by telegram. He comes to Brinkley Court, seeking revenge on Bertie, who avoids Stilton. Bertie learns from Aunt Dahlia that she pawned the pearl necklace her husband Tom Travers bought her to pay for the new serial, without telling Tom. She is wearing a fake pearl necklace instead, and fears that Lord Sidcup, a jewellery expert who is coming to see Uncle Tom's silver collection, will reveal the necklace as a fake. Jeeves suggests that Bertie act as a burglar and steal the fake necklace. Bertie attempts to do so but mistakenly enters Florence's bedroom. She is moved to see him and assumes that he is in love with her. When Stilton comes to return her letters, Florence says she will marry Bertie, and Stilton, finding Bertie in Florence's room, becomes aggressive. Bertie saves himself by reminding Stilton about the Drones Club darts sweep: hurting Bertie could cost Stilton fifty-six pounds and ten shillings. Uncle Tom locks Aunt Dahlia's necklace in a safe. In addition, Lord Sidcup is revealed to be the recently elevated Roderick Spode. After selling his Drones Club darts sweep ticket to Percy Gorringe, Stilton again threatens Bertie. Bertie tries, unsuccessfully, to fend off Stilton with a cosh, though Stilton forgets about Bertie and Florence when he sees Daphne Dolores Morehead and falls for her. Seeing Uncle Tom's safe open, Bertie takes a pearl necklace he sees there. Next he talks to Aunt Dahlia, who says she took the fake necklace from the safe. The necklace Bertie took belongs to Mrs. Trotter. Bertie tries to put back the second necklace, but is unable to do so since Mr. Trotter shuts the safe door. Feudal fidelity would no doubt make Jeeves seal his lips, but you can't let fellows go sealing their lips if it means rendering themselves liable to an exemplary sentence, coupled with some strong remarks from the Bench. Come what might, the dirt would have to be dished. — Bertie prepares to confess At breakfast, Aunt Dahlia's butler Seppings presents Mrs. Trotter's pearl necklace on a salver, stating that he found it in Jeeves's room. Though Bertie prepares to confess stealing the necklace to save Jeeves, Jeeves says he planned to find the necklace's owner, since he realized the pearls were fake and assumed the necklace belonged to a housemaid. Spode, or Lord Sidcup, confirms the pearls are fake. Percy admits that he pawned his mother's real pearl necklace to produce the play based on Florence's novel. Florence is touched, and she and Percy get engaged. Mr. Trotter dislikes Anatole's cooking. However, he feels much better after having one of Jeeves's special drinks, and purchases Milady's Boudoir. Grateful to Jeeves, Bertie agrees to shave off his moustache. The novel is typical of the episodic structure of problems and solutions seen in other late Jeeves novels. Wodehouse increasingly used sudden reversals of plot premises as part of this structure. Two examples of this are the reveal that Spode has sold Eulalie Soeurs, and Mrs. Trotter's unexpected decision that her husband should refuse a knighthood. Another way the novel is similar to other late Jeeves novels is that Bertie and Jeeves feud over one specific thing but cooperate in every other way, and their disagreement serves as an amusing plot point without being structurally crucial as in the early Jeeves novels. One of the stylistic devices Wodehouse uses for comic effect is the transferred epithet, as in chapter 11: ""He waved a concerned cigar"". Wodehouse occasionally creates humorous nonce-compounds, sometimes by adding the word -joy to a noun. This occurs when lip-joy is used to mean '""moustache"" in chapter 4. (Similarly, head-joy is used to mean ""hats"" in chapter 1 of Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves.) Bertie often learns intellectual words from Jeeves and uses them in comic ways, as when Bertie references the Latin phrase rem acu tetigisti, an expression introduced by Jeeves, in chapter 21: ""It was enough. I saw that, as always, he had tetigisti-ed the rem"". Another device used for humour is the pun. For instance, a pun occurs in chapter 6, when Florence talks to Bertie after he has spent a night in jail: ""Are you all right now?""""Well, I have a pinched look."" Wodehouse often uses comical names in his stories. Examples of this in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit include the names of Lemuel Gengulphus Trotter (who is against being knighted due to the fact that he would be called Sir Lemuel) and the night-club Bertie and Florence go to, The Mottled Oyster, as well as the other night-clubs Bertie mentions, such as The Feverish Cheese and the Startled Shrimp. Bertie's searching to find the right word is frequently a source of humour, as when he talks to Jeeves about his cousin Thos in chapter 16: ""Let a plugugly like young Thos loose in the community with a cosh, and you are inviting disasters and…what's the word? Something about cats.""""Cataclysms, sir?""""That's it. Cataclysms."" Antagonists in Wodehouse's stories sometimes express desire to commit acts of violence, as in chapter 2: ""And this had led Stilton, a man of volcanic passions, to express a desire to tear me limb from limb and dance buck-and-wing dances on my remains"". The humour in passages of this kind derives from the obviously ridiculous physical impossibility of the events described. Wodehouse's stories feature many references to the stage that emphasize the similarity between the narrative and a stage performance. This includes dialogue resembling a script, theatrical terminology, and characters described with theatrical conventions. For example, Bertie describes Florence when she is upset after Stilton unexpectedly knocks on her door while Bertie is with her: ""Florence clapped a hand to her throat, a thing I didn't know anybody ever did off the stage"". According to a letter Wodehouse wrote to his friend William ""Bill"" Townend on 13 January 1954, Wodehouse originally wrote Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit as a 30,000 word story, which was refused by various magazines. After rewriting it as a novel, Wodehouse realized the problem: no explanation was given for how Jeeves could tell a supposedly valuable pearl necklace was an imitation. Wodehouse wrote in the letter, ""I have just written to a jeweller asking for professional advice on the point. What I want to know is Can anyone be taught to spot imitation jewels, or do you have to have some sort of flair?"" The problem is resolved in the final version of the novel, in which Jeeves states that he learned while studying under a cousin in the profession that cultured pearls have a core. This story marks the second time Jeeves disapproves of Bertie having a moustache. The first time occurred in ""Jeeves and the Hard-boiled Egg"". At one point in the story, Bertie defends his moustache by stating that a moustache looks good on the actor David Niven, with Jeeves replying that a moustache suits David Niven but not Bertie. David Niven had portrayed Bertie Wooster (with a moustache) in the earlier 1936 film Thank You, Jeeves!. In addition to its UK and US publications, this story was also published under the title Double Jeopardy in Canada, in the 4 December 1954 issue of the Star Weekly, with illustrations by Alex Redmond. The US edition includes a long dedication by Wodehouse to editor Peter Schwed. Under the title Bertie Wooster Sees It Through, the story was included in the Wodehouse collection Five Complete Novels, published by the American publisher Avenel Books in May 1983. The story was adapted into the Jeeves and Wooster episode ""The Delayed Arrival"" which first aired on 6 June 1993. The plot remains largely the same, with some minor changes: Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit was adapted for radio in 1979 as part of the series What Ho! Jeeves starring Michael Hordern as Jeeves and Richard Briers as Bertie Wooster.",Normal
"Dr. Brain is a series of educational games made by Sierra On-Line in the 1990s. The objective of each game is solving a series of puzzles in order to proceed further into the game. The series was later picked up by Knowledge Adventure who turned it into a more action-oriented game. The original two games, Castle of Dr. Brain (1991) and The Island of Dr. Brain (1992), are hybrid puzzle adventure games created by an in-house team at Sierra. After the second game was released, Sierra acquired another company, Bright Star Technology, known for its educational games. The series was turned over to a Bright Star team, explaining the change in direction from the second game to the third. The third and fourth are The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain (1995) and The Time Warp of Dr. Brain (1996). Dr. Brain is an elderly absentminded professor. The first two Sierra games follow the Dr. Thaddeus Egghead Brain, and the last two follow Dr. Thaddeaus Puzzle Brain the Third (the brother of Egghead and uncle of Dr. Elaina Brain). Dr. Brain was 'reincarnated' as Dr. Cranium in Quest for Glory IV (both Dr. Brain and Quest for Glory series are designed by Corey Cole, though Dr. Cranium mentions once that one of his descendants would get ""his very own game"".). The background information for Dr. Cranium in the Shadows of Darkness Hintbook written by Lori and Corey Cole states that Dr. T. Egghead Brain is Dr. Cranium's great-great grandson. Knowledge Adventure later released four games based on the original series: The new series is set in 2326 following a new Dr. Brain, a twenty-something genius instead of an old mad scientist (though this may be explained by identifying the young man with Pro). In the newer games, there are generally less education-oriented and more problem-solving puzzles, although most are third or first person games involving throwing switches and stunning guards (IQ Adventure and Action Reaction).",Normal

"Alma Galarza Flores is a Puerto Rican vocalist best known for her work with Danny Rivera in albums Controversia, Ofrenda and Mi Canción Es Paz. She comes from a family of musicians. One of her biggest inspirations was her aunt, singer Nardy Flores who died at a very young age. Alma started her career in 1977 with Vicente Carattini y Los Cantores de San Juan as one of the dancers. A few years later after noticing her vocal abilities, Vicente added her to the choir. Eventually she sang several songs as lead vocalist and finally in 1985's Controversia (Danny Rivera and Vicente's group) she did lead vocals with Danny in two songs (""Controversia"" and ""De Mi Voz Nació La Luz"") and did lead vocals by herself on ""Plena de los Cantores"". Controversia was the transition from Vicente to Danny. After falling in love with her voice, Danny Rivera offered to bring her with him to record albums and to go on tour but with the condition that she quit Los Cantores. Her first album as a soloist was Ofrenda (1986) in which she is the only female soloist. In Dulce Encuentro she sings half the song by herself while in other songs like Jardinero de Cariños she sings lead along with Danny. Although her last album with Danny was Mi Canción es Paz in 1987 she kept touring with him until 1992. In 1997 Alma released her first ever solo album called ""Jájome"". Due to poor support by local radio stations her album didn't sell too well. However, in 2009, TV producer Javier Avilés heard and loved the album and decided he wanted to make a TV special about it for Christmas. The special included 7 of the 8 songs from the album and was first broadcast on Telemundo Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico TV in 2013. Alma will begin recording her second solo album in late 2014. For several years Alma has been playing in duet Matrimonio Musical with guitarist Luis ""Cholo"" Rivera. They play mostly cover songs of several genres including Puerto Rican folk, ballads, merengue, salsa, among others. They also have some original material and an album is due to be released in 2014.",Normal

"Pikmin is a 2001 real-time strategy puzzle video game developed and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. The game was created and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto, and is the first entry in the Pikmin series. The game's story focuses on an alien pilot, Captain Olimar, who crash lands on a mysterious planet and must make use of a native species called ""Pikmin"" to find his ship's missing parts in order to escape within 30 days. Players take control of Olimar and direct the different varieties of Pikmin to explore the game's various levels, overcoming obstacles and hostile creatures, in order to find and recover the missing ship parts. The game was a critical and commercial success and spawned a series of sequels, starting with Pikmin 2, which was released in 2004. The game was ported to Wii in 2008 under the title New Play Control! Pikmin, while a high-definition remaster was released for Nintendo Switch in 2023. The main goal in the game is to retrieve ship parts by using the three varieties of Pikmin available in different combinations. Captain Olimar discovers multi-colored plant-animal hybrids that willingly follow his orders and help him recover the parts. All three of the Pikmin colors that Olimar discovers must be used in order to overcome various obstacles and complete the game. The Pikmin creatures come in three colors: red, yellow and blue. Red Pikmin are the first type found in the game, resistant to fire and the strongest type of Pikmin with respect to combat. Yellow Pikmin can be thrown higher than the other two and can carry explosives called ""bomb rocks"" . They are utilized in various tasks, including carrying objects and enemies, breaking down walls, and defeating enemies. Blue Pikmin are the only ones that are able to survive in water and throw Pikmin of other colors across it. Objects that can be carried vary between ship parts, enemy carcasses and pellets, which are brought back to a base camp established in the current zone, containing Olimar's ship and apparati representative of each kind of Pikmin called Onions, the latter which can convert carcasses and pellets to Pikmin seeds. Only one hundred Pikmin, whether planted or plucked, can be on the ground at a time. The time limit is divided into thirty days. With the exception of the first day, which lasts until the player finds the first ship part, all days in the game are about thirteen minutes in length, which can prematurely end at the player's request or if Olimar's health, replenished at his spacecraft, is depleted from attacks by native creatures. The day also ends prematurely if all Pikmin in the zone go extinct, and the next day will begin with one new seed of every discovered kind of Pikmin. By the end of each day, Olimar needs to stop all work and bring as many Pikmin as possible back to the base camp so that they can flee the planet's nocturnal predators in the safety of their Onions, as they also provide Pikmin shelter and transportation between zones; any Pikmin who do not make it back to base are eaten by said predators on each night prior to Olimar's last day on the planet. At such time, Olimar will write a daily update to his ship log, which may be affected by events on that particular day, reflect on his efforts to escape, or provide useful gameplay hints. As more parts are recovered, the ship regains functionality and can bring Olimar to up to four new zones on the planet to find the remaining parts. The game has three different endings, depending on Olimar's progress in collecting ship parts. Collecting all thirty grants the best ending, while collecting at least the twenty-five mandatory parts within the 30-day time limit grants the normal ending. Failing to do so results in Olimar's ship's life support system failing and Olimar dying from oxygen poisoning. Apart from the main gameplay, Pikmin also contains a Challenge Mode that is unlocked once Olimar gets all three types of Pikmin. Each of the five zones in the main game are available for play. The object of Challenge Mode is to grow the greatest number of Pikmin in one day as is possible. While on an intergalactic vacation, Captain Olimar crashes on an uncharted planet when his ship, the S.S. Dolphin, is hit by an asteroid. Upon entering the planet's atmosphere, numerous parts break off of the S.S. Dolphin. Olimar regains consciousness after the crash and realizes that his life support will only function for another 30 days, after which he will succumb to the planet's oxygen (poisonous to his species). He begins his search for the 30 missing ship parts in hopes of returning home before his life support fails. Immediately after beginning his search, Olimar finds a nearly-extinct plant-like species. He names the species ""Pikmin"" as they are similar in appearance to the ""Pikpik"" carrots he is familiar with on his home planet. When the Pikmin demonstrate their worksmanship, Olimar decides to use them for his quest to retrieve the ship parts. Along the way, he discovers other types of Pikmin and is able to increase their numbers by bringing nutrients and the bodies of defeated creatures back to their hive, which Olimar calls an ""Onion"". The ending is determined by how many parts Olimar and the Pikmin are able to collect. Pikmin was developed by Nintendo EAD and directed by Shigefumi Hino and Masamichi Abe (who had directed 1080° Snowboarding) and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and Hiroyuki Kimura as one of the first GameCube games. Colin Reed, who had programmed 1080° Snowboarding, programmed Pikmin. The foundation of Pikmin technology is in the animation and agency of a multitude of interacting characters. A technical demonstration called Super Mario 128 was shown at Nintendo Space World 2000, showing the performance of the prototype GameCube hardware by animating up to 128 copies of Mario at once. Miyamoto stated in 2007 that ""most of you have already played  - but you played it in a game called Pikmin."" The name ""Pikmin"" derives from the Japanese word used during development to count the small creatures, ""ippiki"", which became ""Piki"", then ""Picky"" and finally ""Pikmin"". The development team of Pikmin expressed their initial trouble finding the game's direction. Hino explains: I still can clearly recall the first time that I saw multiple Pikmin working together to carry a big opponent. Until then, we had been struggling to find the direction that this game should have, but when these ""carry"" actions were completed, we were able to determine the future of Pikmin. The score was composed by Hajime Wakai, who was one of two composers for Star Fox 64. Pikmin was developed on Microsoft Windows. A Windows version of the game with debugging features is hidden on the GameCube version's disc. Upon being revealed at E3 2001, Pikmin garnered positive reception. IGN praised it for its uniqueness and its stunning graphics, with only a few negative points such as a poor camera. It was awarded the title of ""Best PuzzleTriviaParlor Game"" from the Game Critics Awards, beating out ChuChu Rocket! for the Game Boy Advance. It was also runner-up for ""Most Original Game"", losing out to Majestic. It was a nominee for GameSpot's annual ""Best GameCube Game"" and, among console games, ""Most Innovative"" awards. These went respectively to Super Smash Bros. Melee and Grand Theft Auto III. Since its release for the GameCube, Pikmin has received positive reception. It holds an average score of 89100 from Metacritic. It was given the award for interactivity from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Pikmin has received significant praise for its graphics, in particular the design of the surrounding environment. Gaming Age editor Craig Majaski described Pikmin as both stunning and having a detailed environment. Brian McTaggart of the Houston Chronicle praised it for its graphics, gameplay, and originality, but criticized it for being short. As of March 31, 2002, Pikmin has sold over one million copies. Chris Slate reviewed the GameCube version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that ""A charming, addictive game that backs up Nintendo's promise to innovate on GameCube. If you like puzzles, then get your thinking cap on and put those Pikmin to work."" During the 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences honored Pikmin with the ""Innovation in Console Gaming"" award, along with receiving nominations for ""Console Game of the Year"" and ""Outstanding Achievement in Game Design"". The Wii re-release of Pikmin was not as well-received as the GameCube version, though it still had mostly positive reception; it holds an average score of 77100 from Metacritic. In his review of the Nintendo Switch version, PJ O'Reilly of Nintendo Life described the remaster as ""bare-bones"". He compared it to Super Mario 3D All-Stars, where many of the graphical updates consist of upscaling as opposed to a more detailed reworking of the game's textures. He nonetheless praised the core game, calling it a ""must-play"" and giving the remaster a score of 810. In its first week, Pikmin sold more than 101,000 copies. However, sales fell to only between 10,000 and 15,000 copies in the weeks following. Following the release of ""Ai no Uta"" by Strawberry Flower, an image song related to Pikmin, its sales recovered slightly to about 22,000 copies in a week. The song appeared in the Japanese commercials for the game, but soon became an unexpected hit song, eventually eclipsing Pikmin's sales. In the weeks of December 24, 2001 and January 6, 2002, Pikmin sold approximately 53,000 copies and 102,000 copies respectively. To date, Pikmin has sold at least 1.19 million copies worldwide; 680,000 in the United States and 507,011 in Japan. By January 3, 2010, the Wii version of Pikmin had sold 169,036 copies in Japan. Since its release, Pikmin has developed a vocal and devoted fanbase. Pikmin and its sequel Pikmin 2 are part of the New Play Control series, a selection of GameCube video game remakes with additional support for features of the Wii. It was released on December 25, 2008 in Japan, February 6, 2009 in Europe and March 9, 2009 in North America (original version only). New Play Control! Pikmin uses the Wii Remote, and requires the player to point and click on the screen to do various tasks instead of manually moving a cursor with a control stick. It was also announced that the game saves day-by-day records of the player's playthrough, allowing the player to restart from any recorded day of their choice. In an interview, director Shigefumi Hino stated that besides adding motion controls, they wanted to include the ability to go back to saves they have made in the past, allowing players to replay all 30 days one by one in order to improve. HD remasters of Pikmin and Pikmin 2 for Nintendo Switch were announced and released digitally on June 21, 2023 and was released physically on September 22, 2023.",Normal

"Perpetual prayer (Latin: laus perennis) is the Christian practice of continuous prayer carried out by a group. The practice of perpetual prayer was inaugurated by the archimandrite Alexander (died about 430), the founder of the monastic Acoemetae or ""vigil-keepers"". Laus perennis was imported to Western Europe at St. Maurice's Abbey in Agaunum, where it was carried on, day and night, by several choirs, or turmae, who succeeded each other in the recitation of the divine office, so that prayer went on without cessation. Called the Akoimetoi (""Sleepless Ones""), these monks prayed ""a monastic round of twenty-four offices to fill every hour."" The inauguration of laus perennis at Agaunum c. 515 was the occasion of a solemn ceremony, and of a sermon by St. Avitus which survives. The ""custom of Agaunum"", as it came to be called, spread over Gaul, to Lyons, Châlons, the Abbey of Saint Denis, to Luxeuil, Saint-Germain at Paris, Saint Medard at Soissons, to Saint-Riquier, and was taken up by the monks of Remiremont Abbey and Laon Abbey, though the Abbey of Agaunum had ceased to practice it from the beginning of the ninth century. The various Roman Catholic orders of nuns dedicated to the perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament may be seen as a modern variation on this theme, because in addition to the usual complete daily liturgical celebration of the Eucharist and Divine Office, these monastic communities also observe a perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, which usually involves having at least two members of the monastic community always being present in prayerful, silent contemplation of the Blessed Sacrament (i.e., a consecrated Host) exposed to view in a monstrance on the altar of the principal chapel. These monastic communities may themselves see their particular vocation as a part of a larger, more traditional monastic order, such as the Benedictine Sisters of Perpetual Adoration in Clyde, Missouri. The first known Protestant continuous prayer was the ""Hourly Intercession"" of the Moravian Brethren in Herrnhut, Saxony. Beginning in 1727, the prayer continued 24 hours a day every day uninterrupted for over 100 years. The Moravian Unity began this continuous prayer vigil anew in 1957 as part of their 500th anniversary observance. Today, perpetual prayer is a common practice in many churches. Often the term 24-7 prayer is used to express that the prayer continues 24 hours 7 days a week. A notable example of current day perpetual prayer is the Jerusalem House of Prayer, International House of Prayer in Kansas City as well as other prayer houses such as the Justice House of Prayer that were inspired by this ministry. Many churches organize 24-7 prayer weeks that last for one or several weeks. Also, many of the Cursillo, Walk to Emmaus and other similar Three Day and 4th Day Movements employ a similar laus perennis model during the actual retreats as 4th Day members who have already attended the events sign up for and maintain a continuous prayer clock throughout each retreat of each community with specific prayers for each new participant, or pilgrim.",Normal

"Jundiaí is a municipality in the state of São Paulo, in the Southeast Region of Brazil, located 57 kilometres (35mi) north of São Paulo. The population of the city is 423,006 (2020 est.), with an area of 431.21km². The elevation is 761 m. The GDP of the city is U$16.6 billion (R$36.6 billion). The budget for 2013 is U$787 million (R$1.63 billion), according to the official data of the City Hall. The locally most-accepted history of the first non-native American colonizers of the locale were Rafael de Oliveira and Petronilha Rodrigues Antunes who fled São Paulo for political reasons and who in 1615 then founded what became known as the Freguesia de Nossa Senhora do Desterro (""The Parish of Our Lady of the Landless""). The municipality was officially founded on December 14, 1655, when it was elevated to the category of village. Its first urbanization was carried out in 1657. Jundiaí has borders with Várzea Paulista, Campo Limpo Paulista, Franco da Rocha, Cajamar, Pirapora do Bom Jesus, Cabreúva, Itupeva, Louveira, Vinhedo, Itatiba and Jarinu. Formerly spelled Jundiahy, the name of the town comes from the Tupi language, jundiá means ""fish with barbs"" (the Rhamdia quelen species) and í means river. Loosely translated, it means ""Catfish River."" The city received massive numbers of Italian immigrants in the late 19th century and early 20th century, making most of the city's inhabitants of Italian descent, which constitutes about 75% of the city's population. Amongst other immigrant groups, there are: Portuguese, Spanish, German and small amounts of Hungarian and Slavic peoples. Recently, Jundiaí has enjoyed a steep population growth, in large part fueled by a shift of residents from the megalopolis of São Paulo, seeking better living conditions. The region burst onto the national stage with the production of grapes, especially with the ""pink"" variety of the Niagara grape. To stimulate the production of grapes, with the support of the Associação Agrícola de Jundiaí e Prefeitura (Agriculture Association of Jundiaí and Town Hall), in 1934 Antenor Soares Gandra created the Festa da Uva (Grape Festival), not to be confused with a festival of the same name in Caxias do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul. Since 1964 the Festa da Uva is celebrated every even-numbered year, alternating with the Festa do Morango (Strawberry Festival) in the park Parque Comendador Antonio Carbonari but most known as the Parque da Uva (Grape Park). The first Festa do Morango was in 1965 in the Poste neighborhood of the city. Later, because of the increase in agriculture participants and of the public interest, the event was transferred to the Parque Comendador Antonio Carbonari. The Serra do Japi (Japi mountain range), situated southeast of the city, is a state park that has a natural reserve with one of the largest forested areas in the state of São Paulo, with beautiful landscapes and many opportunities for ecotourism, large hotel-farms and extreme sports. The Jundiahy section is a historical area amongst the rivers Jundiai, Guapeva and Mato. It is an affluent neighborhood with fancy houses, gardens and a traditional small community business. Paulista is the city's football (soccer) club. The team, which plays at Jayme Cintra Stadium, was the champion of Copa do Brasil 2005 (Cup of Brazil). The Jundiaí Airport serves the city and region for small airplanes. Jundiaí has a connection in the Jundiaí station with Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM). It has a system of public transportation that costs R$5,00 (USD 0,97) for a one way ticket, as of 2023. Most of the buses have wheelchair lifts and a few have monitors that broadcast videos about the city and education. The lines are all connected by terminais (terminals), what makes the users' transportation faster and cheaper since there is free circulation in the terminals to the linhas alimentadoras (feeding lines), which carry the passengers from the terminals to their respective destinations . Regular users can register and use a yellow, reloadable electronic card. Students can register for a blue card that charges only half price for each ticket. The elderly or disabled can register for a grey or green card which allows free admittance.",Normal
"William Grant Fournier  (June 21, 1913 – January 13, 1943) was a United States Army soldier and a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration—the Medal of Honor—for his actions in World War II. Fournier was raised by his aunts and uncles in the town of South Kingstown, Rhode Island and enlisted in the Navy in 1931, at the age of 18, where he served for nearly a decade before retiring. Fournier re-enlisted in the military before the beginning of World War II, this time in the Army, from Winterport, Maine in September 1940, and by January 10, 1943, was serving as a Sergeant in Company M, 35th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. During a Japanese attack on that day, at Mount Austen, Guadalcanal, in the Solomon Islands, he refused an order to withdraw after many men in his unit had been killed or wounded and, with fellow soldier Technician Fifth Grade Lewis Hall, stayed behind to man a machine gun. Hall was killed at the gun, while Fournier was badly wounded and died three days later. Both men were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor on June 5, 1943. Fournier, aged 29 at his death, was buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii. Sergeant Fournier's official Medal of Honor citation reads: For gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty. As leader of a machinegun section charged with the protection of other battalion units, his group was attacked by a superior number of Japanese, his gunner killed, his assistant gunner wounded, and an adjoining guncrew put out of action. Ordered to withdraw from this hazardous position, Sgt. Fournier refused to retire but rushed forward to the idle gun and, with the aid of another soldier who joined him, held up the machinegun by the tripod to increase its field action. They opened fire and inflicted heavy casualties upon the enemy. While so engaged both these gallant soldiers were killed, but their sturdy defensive was a decisive factor in the following success of the attacking battalion.",Normal

"The 231st Combat Communications Squadron, District of Columbia Air National Guard, was a tenant unit of the 113th Wing based at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, United States. The squadron used traditional military communications systems such as the Defense Switch Network (DSN), the Automated Digital Network (AUTODIN), and Defense Messaging System (DMS), as well as off-the-shelf commercial communications systems. The 231st began on 1 February 1952, when the 8205th Air Base Squadron was activated. The unit's mission was to receive, maintain, and store equipment as well as provide trained personnel for the soon-to-be formed 231st Airways and Air Communications Service (AACS) Squadron (Mobile) which was to be stationed at Camp Simms, Washington, DC). The unit was inactivated on 26 August 1952, when its personnel and equipment were transferred to the 231st AACS Sq (Mobile). On 1 July 1961, the 231st AACS Sq (Mobile) was renamed the 231st Mobile Communications Squadron. The unit kept this name until January 1966, when the unit became the 231st Mobile Communications Squadron (Bare Base). A separate 231st Flight Facilities Flight (FFF) assumed air traffic control functions. In 1968, the words ""Bare Base"" were removed from the Squadron designation, and the unit mobilized for the Pueblo Crisis. Activated for two weeks, the 231st was demobilized on 17 April of that year. In 1969, the 231st saw its first change of command when Lt. Col. Tuckerman retired and was replaced by Maj. Charles Milton. Tuckerman's 17 years as commanding officer was the longest of any commander in the history of the 231st. By 1971, the 231st had a role in both federal and state support with its participation in the DC National Guard's Task Force Blue. This mission enabled the 231st to provide civil support to the District of Columbia during times of civil disturbance or to aid the Metropolitan Police Department by being deputized for other events. The 231st took part in various civil missions, including the 1961 Nikita Khrushchev visit to the United States, the 1963 Civil Rights March. In 1972, the Flight Facilities Flight was merged into the 231st, and on 8 December 1972 the unit was inactivated and returned to the National Guard Bureau. The unit was renamed the 231st Mobile Communications Squadron (Tactical Air Base) to reflect its standalone capability. In May 1976, the word ""Mobile"" was replaced by ""Combat"" in the Squadron's official designation. That year saw another change to the Squadron's operations as it began to move from its 25-acre (100,000m2) home at Camp Simms to Andrews Air Force Base. The buildings to be occupied by the 231st began construction in July 1976, and they were completed by August 1978. The unit accomplished its first overseas deployment in 1981 when members of the squadron participated at Exercise Flintlock 81 in England. The 231st provided the Air National Guard's first radar approach control operations in 1983 at Martinsburg, and it also pioneered the Air Guard's first airspace surveillance support to Camp David beginning in 1983. In 1985, the unit was renamed the 231st Combat Information Systems Squadron. In October 1986, it was renamed again, getting its current designation, the 231st Combat Communications Squadron. At the end of the Cold War the unit began a new era of operations with Operations Desert Shield and Storm. During Operational Display Determination in 1991, the unit deployed 20 members to Turkey to support humanitarian assistance to the Kurds in Northern Iraq. In 1999 the unit again responded when the squadron received a Presidential Selective Reserve Call-Up (PSRC) for operations in the NATO Bosnia and Kosovo Campaigns. During the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the unit was active in setting up a static ground communications system to support the 113th Wing's airfield operations in establishing combat air patrols over the nation's capital. In January 2003 the unit was called by the 1st Air Force to provide communications command and control in support of the Integrated Air Defense (IAD) of the National Capital Region during the 2003 Presidential State of the Union Address. Twenty personnel from the unit volunteered to pack up 60 short tons of equipment to support Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. Three members of the unit were deployed into the combat theater during Operation Iraqi Freedom, while another 12 personnel worked at the Air National Guard's Crisis Action Team from 2001 to 2004 in support of Operation Noble Eagle. In 2004, the unit began to receive the new Theatre Deployable Communications gear, technology designed to transmit and receive communications anywhere in the world. The system is designed to reduce the communication problems normally associated with airlift and manpower. During Hurricane Isabel in October 2003, the unit provided equipment to the 911 Emergency Response Center in Baltimore. This was the first time that the DC Air National Guard had provided equipment support outside of the District to another State. During Hurricane Katrina in September 2005, members of the unit deployed to New Orleans and Pineville, LA to provide communications in support of recovery efforts. In 2007, the 231st Combat Communications Squadron was designated for inactivation, effective March 2008. During its lifetime, the 231st won 5 Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards.",Normal

"Thomas Parker (11 July 1829 – 25 November 1903) was Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon Superintendent of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway from 1886–1893. He introduced a new type of locomotive in Britain, which used a Belpaire firebox. Parker was born in Ayrshire in 1829, and began his career as an apprentice at the Greenock works of the Caledonian Railway. In 1858 he moved away from Scotland. At the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway he was Carriage and Wagon Superintendent at the railway's Gorton works. He was one of the first to construct 6-wheeled bogie coaches, and in 1885 he produced one of the first dining car designs in Britain. In 1886, he replaced Charles Reboul Sacre as locomotive, wagon and carriage superintendent. In 1891 he introduced the first locomotive on a British railway to use a Belpaire firebox, which had been used on export locomotives built by the local manufacturer Beyer Peacock since 1872. The continuous vacuum brake and internal communication cord were introduced by the railway, gaining Board of Trade approval in 1893. Parker retired in 1893 and was succeeded by Harry Pollitt.

"Domingo de Soto, O.P. (1494 – 15 November 1560) was a Spanish Dominican priest and Scholastic theologian born in Segovia (Spain), and died in Salamanca (Spain), at the age of 66. He is best known as one of the founders of international law and of the Spanish Thomistic philosophical and theological movement known as the School of Salamanca. He is also known for his contributions to mechanical physics: His works on mechanics, which he presented in his book ""Physicorum Aristotelis quaestiones"", in 1551, served as the basis for Galileo's and Isaac Newton studies. De Soto was born in Segovia in 1494. He studied philosophy and theology at the Universities of Alcalá and Paris, and obtained a chair in philosophy at Alcalá in 1520. Soto resigned from this post suddenly and headed for the abbey of Montserrat, hoping to join the Benedictines, but he was instead led to the Dominicans, entering their community at San Pablo de Burgos in 1524 and becoming professor of dialectics at their Segovia house of studies in 1525. Appointed to the Dominican chair in theology at Salamanca in 1532, he was promoted to the principal chair in 1552, as successor to Melchor Cano. From his earliest days in the university classroom, Soto undertook an attack on the via moderna and pressed for a revival of Aristotle. At Salamanca he collaborated with Francisco de Vitoria and Cano in their methodological reforms and on the development of what came to be known as positive or fundamental theology. Sent as imperial theologian to the Council of Trent by the emperor Charles V, Soto soon distinguished himself for his learning and piety (1545–1547). Steering the council away from compromise with the Protestants, he served as one of the principal defenders of tradition on such key questions as original sin, predestination, justification, the scriptural canon, and the authority of the Vulgate Bible. In 1547, when the council was interrupted, Soto was appointed confessor and spiritual adviser to Charles V, a post he fulfilled for two years. Immensely pleased by Soto, Charles offered him the bishopric of Segovia. Soto refused the honor and in 1550 returned to teaching at Salamanca. That same year he took part in the celebrated debate held at Valladolid on the treatment of New World natives, joining his Dominican brethren in a thorough condemnation of the idea that the Indians were inferior beings worthy of enslavement. Soto’s chief opponent in this controversy was Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda, chaplain and official chronicler to Emperor Charles V. Sepúlveda’s defeat at the hands of Soto and other Dominicans led to the enactment of laws protecting the rights of native peoples in the New World. In addition to producing such influential philosophical and theological works as the Summulae (1529), a manual of logic; De natura et gratia (1547), a polemic against Protestant soteriology; and his commentaries on Aristotle (1543 and 1545), on Paul's epistle to the Romans (1550), and on Peter Lombard's Sentences (1557), Soto contributed significantly to the development of political and legal theory, principally through his De iustitia et iure (1553), his most important jurisprudential work, in which he proposed that the ordinance of reason (rationis ordinatio) was the mechanism by which laws could be evaluated. He also took the view that international law (jus gentium) was a part of the law of specific communities (later termed positive law) rather than a moral or natural law. True to the school of Salamanca's predilection for ethical questions and to its conviction that theology should be used to create a Christian moral order based on natural law, Soto also devoted attention to the issue of poverty, producing a landmark study, Deliberatio in causa pauperum (1545), and devising ways to feed and lodge the poorer students at Salamanca. Like his fellow Spanish Dominicans Vitoria and Cano, Soto contributed substantially to the reinvigoration of Roman Catholicism in the sixteenth century by strengthening and broadening the theological curriculum, by stressing the need for continuity with the scholastic tradition (especially with Thomism), and by actively seeking social justice. Soto died in Salamanca on 15 November 1560. De Soto was concerned about the complexity that had emerged from unclear moral standards of usury. He complained that the merchants had invented convoluted schemes in order to meet the conflicting demands of church leaders. His position should be seen within the background of his Dominican background and historical context. De Soto was involved in an active debate in the medieval era on the sterility of money and the requirements of natural law given this sterility. His rationale on interest is explained by Langholm. Woods and D'Emic characterize de Soto's attitude toward usury in significantly different ways. D'Emic reports that De Soto thought voluntary contributions given from borrower to lender in gratitude were acceptable, but strictly forbid the lender from pressuring the borrower. He also asserts that De Soto thought lenders were permitted to hope for such contributions along with other motives of benevolence and friendship, but regarded the sole motivation of financial gain as immoral ""mental usury"". Woods, on the other hand, reports that De Soto did not believe Christ had declared usury to be sinful at all, and did not believe that Luke 6:35 had anything to do with lending at interest. In 1551, Domingo de Soto became the first to state that a body in free fall accelerates uniformly. This key concept in physics was essential for the posterior studies of the gravity laws by Galileo and Newton. In the 20th century, Pierre Duhem credited him with important achievements in dynamics and viewed his work as a forerunner of modern mechanics. In 1556, Soto published a treatise on law, De Justitia and Jure (Justice and the Law), that is considered a foundational text in the general theory of law, and international law, in particular. Like his teacher Francisco de Vitoria, Soto helped to provide a modern insight to the Spanish conquests in the New World, helping to build the concept of people's rights, including the right to private property of the native Americans. Soto is also famous for having defended the rights of the legitimate poor against imperial and urban policies restricting access to poor relief.",Normal
"Smaller were an English alternative rock, Britpop band from Liverpool, active during the 1990s. They had hits with ""Wasted"" and ""Is"" in 1996 and 1997. The band was formed in the early 1990s by former Cook da Books guitaristsinger Peter ""Digsy"" Deary, his brother Steven (drums), Jason Riley (guitarvocals), and Paul Cavanagh (bass guitar). The band's debut release was the single ""God I Hate This Town"" in 1995. They recorded a session for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show in November that year. A second single failed to chart, but they broke into the UK top 75 with ""Wasted"" in September 1996. Their next single, ""Is"", which featured Noel Gallagher on guitar, gave them their biggest hit, reaching number 55 in the UK in March 1997. The band's debut album, Badly Badly, was released in April 1997, featuring further contributions from Gallagher. A second album was recorded, featuring a guest appearance from Richard Hawley, but it remained unreleased, various members of the band left and were replaced by friends of the Smallers - Lee Watson on guitar and Chris Mullin on bass joined 1999, drummers Bren Moore & Chris Campbell came along later and the transition from Smaller to The Sums happened in 2005.

"4 Way Street is a live album by Crosby, Stills & Nash, and their second album as Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. It was originally released as Atlantic Records SD-2-902, shipping as a gold record and peaking at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. A document of their tour from the previous year, the live recordings presented were taken from shows at the Fillmore East (New York City) on June 2 through June 7, 1970; The Forum (Los Angeles, California) on June 26 through June 28, 1970; and the Auditorium Theatre (Chicago, Illinois) on July 5, 1970. At the time this album was recorded, tensions between the band members were high, with their dressing-room fights becoming the stuff of rock legend, even being referenced by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention in their 1971 LP Fillmore East - June 1971. The tensions led to CSNY dissolving shortly after the recording of 4 Way Street; they would reconvene for a stadium tour in the summer of 1974. The next release of new studio material by the group proper would not be until CSN in 1977, without Neil Young. The original double album LP came packaged in a gatefold sleeve without a track listing. On the gatefold was a black-and-white picture of the band sitting on a bench, with the heads of Graham Nash and David Crosby framed by a wire clothes hanger hanging in front of them, with recording information and credits in the lower-right-hand corner. The only track listings appear on the album's labels and on the fold-out poster that also included full lyrics. At the time of these concerts in mid-1970, many songs included on the eventual album had yet to be released as part of the combined and individual work of the four principals. Crosby's ""The Lee Shore"" had been recorded during the sessions for Déjà Vu but would not appear until the band's 1991 box set, and his controversial ménage à trois composition ""Triad,"" which had been recorded but not released by his former band The Byrds, had been recorded by Jefferson Airplane on their Crown of Creation album but this is the first issued performance by Crosby himself. ""Love the One You're With"" would be the hit single taken from Stephen Stills, Stills's debut solo album, released later that year. ""Chicago"" by Nash would appear on his Songs for Beginners released in 1971, the same year as 4 Way Street, while ""Right Between the Eyes"" would be later surface as a demo on his box set Reflections. ""Don't Let It Bring You Down"" and ""Southern Man"" by Young would be released on After the Gold Rush, his third album also released later that year. Young's ""On the Way Home"" had appeared on the final Buffalo Springfield album, but with a lead vocal by Richie Furay rather than Young. Stills' ""49 Bye-ByesAmerica's Children"" medley interpolates the only top ten hit by Buffalo Springfield, his song ""For What It's Worth."" The band did include both sides of what was at the time of the shows their new record, the single ""Ohio"" and its B-side ""Find the Cost of Freedom."" Sides one and two featured acoustic guitars and demonstrated the band as a group of individuals also pursuing independent careers while sides three and four featured the full band playing electric guitars and rock and roll. On sides one and two and on the 1992 bonus tracks, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young all performed solo while Crosby & Nash previewed their later partnership with ""The Lee Shore"" and ""Right Between the Eyes"" performed by the pair. On April 13, 2019, for Record Store Day, Atlantic Records released a three-LP version of the 1992 Expanded Edition. It was mastered by Chris Bellman and pressed on 180-gram vinyl. Sides 1, 2, 3 and 4 contained the original track listing of the 1971 version, while the additional tracks ""King Midas In Reverse"", ""Laughing"", and ""Black Queen"" were pressed on Side 5, and ""The LonerCinnamon GirlDown By The River"" were pressed on Side 6. The album reached number one on the Billboard 200 upon its release and also garnered a positive review in Rolling Stone, in which critic George Edward Kimball called it ""their best album to date."" Other contemporary reviews have also been positive. Nash produced an expanded form of 4 Way Street for compact disc, released on June 15, 1992. The expanded edition included four solo performances on acoustic guitars, one by each member. Neil Young performed a medley of three songs from his first two solo albums; Stephen Stills included the at-the-time unreleased ""Black Queen"" from his eponymous debut; Crosby contributed his also yet to be issued ""Laughing"" from his 1971 debut LP; and Nash performed ""King Midas in Reverse,"" The Hollies' single from 1967, which although credited to Allan Clarke, Nash and Tony Hicks, was written solely by Nash. Additional tracks from the tour appeared on the CSN box set released in 1991, as well as Young's The Archives Vol. 1 1963–1972 released in 2009.

"The long song (Mongolian: ᠤᠷᠲᠠ ᠢᠢᠨᠳᠠᠭᠤᠨ, Urtyn duu) is one of the central elements of the traditional music of Mongolia. This genre is called ""Long song"" not only because the songs are long, but also because each syllable of text is extended for a long duration. A four-minute song may only consist of ten words. Certain long songs such as Uvgin shuvuu khoyor, also known as Jargaltain delger (lit. 'Old man and the Bird') take up to three hours to sing at full length, with all thirty-two stanzas. Lyrical themes vary depending on context; they can be philosophical, religious, romantic, or celebratory, and often use horses as a symbol or theme repeated throughout the song. Eastern Mongols typically use a Morin khuur (horse-head fiddle) as accompaniment, sometimes with a type of indigenous flute, called limbe. Oirat groups of the Western Mongols traditionally sing long songs unaccompanied or accompanied with the Igil. The Mongolian long song folk music tradition has ties to other national traditions and customs, including Mongolian history, culture, aesthetics, ethics and philosophy. The main feature of the long song is the shuranhai (prolonged, tenuto notes with deeply modulated vibrato on the vowels). The Mongol aizam long songs are ancient grand songs that possess extensively broad vocal diapason and diverse vocal movement techniques, elaborate singing elements and vocal improvisations such as dan (single) and davkhar (double) shurankhai (tenuto notes with deeply modulated vibrato on the vowels), nugalaa (sharp notes modulated in lower pitch), various vocal ‘soothing’ long-drawns, upward and downward usrelt (tone leaps or sudden transmission to higher or lower tones), tsokhilgo (vocal modulated pulsation), tsatslaga (sprinkling), khayalga (bestrewing or free improvised tone), shigshree (sifting or repeated vocal vibration) and other unique singing techniques. These features give the long song profound philosophical, meditational character, often depicting the spacious mountain valleys and a sense of tranquility, believed to represent the Mongolian soul. Three major styles are identified in long songs: besreg urtyn duu (""minor long song""), suman urtyn duu (""ordinary long song"") and aizam urtyn duu (""major' or majestic long songs""). Again, the styles reflect the way of the performance of the shuranhai and other techniques rather than the lengths of the songs. The word ‘Aizam’ comes from the non-lexical vocable of ‘Aya, zee khu’ at the beginning of the grand long song, which features a broad melody with a context of philosophical theme, ceremony and quality of ode, honor, respect or solemnity. The aizam grand long songs are sung in a sequence at the beginning of a ceremony or feast, in accordance with the special ceremonial rules, and constitute the summit of the long songs which test the skills and capability of the singer and morin khuur (horse-headed fiddle) player. UNESCO declared the Mongolian Long Song one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2005. On April 12, 2013, the 'Mongolian Statehood Long Song' was officially exalted at the Mongolian Statehood History Museum located in the State Ceremony Great Hall of the Government House of Mongolia. 'Mongolian Statehood Long Song' is an album of nine Mongolian aizam (""grande"") long songs, including Ertnii saikhan (""Ancient Splendid""), Tumen Ekh (""Myriad's Leader""), Khuur Magnai (""Fiddle Leader""), Durtmal saikhan (""Iridescent Splendid""), Kherlengiin bariya (""Sight of Kherulen River""), Ikh Zambuutiviin naran (The Sun over the Placid World), Asaryn undur (""Heavenly Noble""), Erkhem tur (Statehood of Excellence) and Enkh mendiin bayar (""Celebration of Welfare""). These songs were sung by Dorjdagva Myagmarsuren, long song singer and now independent researcher. He served as a researcher at the International Institute for the Study of Nomadic Civilizations, a UNESCO branch institution, in 2007-2021. The morin khuur musician on the project is Battulga Batbold, one of the most proficient morin khuur musicians at present. This album is the first and only recording of full-length Mongolian grand long songs, which were almost lost during the socialist regime, when the long song was only allowed to be sung on stage for 3–5 minutes. It did become a significant event in the history of Mongolian musicology, folk music tradition, cultural heritage and continuation and preservation of Mongolian classic art of long song, according to Mongolian renowned scholars, researchers, academicians and musicologists. The songs on the album feature singing at full length (direct audio recording without any pause, music arrangement nor engineering), complete lyrics, authentic Mongolian singing techniques, different singing styles of Central Khalkha or Eastern Mongolia and Western Mongolia as well as ancient melody of each song restored on the basis of his research of a dozen years as well as accompaniment of authentic traditional Morin khuur with leather cover and horse-hair strings. The total length of the nine long songs is 258 minutes, each song with a length of 25–35 minutes. The single edition of Mongolian Statehood Long Song encased in a wooden case inlaid with nine jewels is donated to, registered and kept at the State Intangible Heritage Fund of National Cultural Heritage Center of Mongolia. In September 2014, the album of Mongolian Statehood Long Song by M.Dorjdagva was released publicly with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Mongolia and the Arts and Culture Development Foundation of Mongolia. Music researcher Ojuna W. Pilcher has published several studies of the long song in the region of Alxa League in Inner Mongolia. She has observed that the long song today expresses a nostalgia of the past after modernization, and “visual and zoological metaphors connected to the nomadic lifestyle are not only highly significant to urtyn duu’s song texts, categorization, and singing technique but are also closely related to ornamentation, the achievement of vocal timbre, the singers’ understanding of nomadic herding life, and their feelings of longing and nostalgia as expressed through the music.”",Normal

"Daniel Lionel Hanington (June 27, 1835 – May 5, 1909) was a New Brunswick, Canada politician and jurist. He was born at Shediac, New Brunswick, the son of Daniel Hanington, and was educated there and at Mount Allison Academy in Sackville. He went on to study law and was called to the New Brunswick bar in 1861. In that same year, he married Emily Myers Wetmore. He served as a school trustee for several years and was clerk for the Westmorland County court from 1867 to 1870. Hanington ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the provincial legislature for Westmorland in 1870 but was elected in an 1870 by-election as a Liberal-Conservative. He was defeated in 1874 then regained his seat in 1878 and entered the cabinet of Premier John James Fraser as minister without portfolio and succeeded Fraser as premier in 1882. Hanington was sympathetic to Acadian rights and appointed a member of that community, Pierre-Amand Landry, to the senior cabinet position of provincial secretary. However, Hanington faced a leader of the opposition, Andrew G. Blair who had organised the Liberal Party into a powerful force. In 1883, Blair defeated Hanington's Conservative government in a Motion of No Confidence and won the subsequent election. Hanington continued as leader of the opposition but was unable to defeat Blair's Liberals in the 1886 election. He remained in the legislature until 1892 and, in 1896, he accepted an appointment to the bench as a member of the province's Supreme Court. He was the presiding judge at the last trial of Tom Collins.",Normal
"Harold Lightman QC (8 April 1906 in Leeds – 27 September 1998 in London) was an English barrister, who was awarded the unique honour of a dinner at Lincoln's Inn to celebrate his 90th birthday. Harold Lightman was the son of a Lithuanian refugee, who had fled to Leeds, England, and then spent a some time in Australia. He returned to Leeds, married a Scottish-born Jew of German parentage. His father set up a furniture-making business in Leeds. Lightman was educated at the City of Leeds School until he was 14, when he began to get bad headaches. He then worked in his father's factory, and at the age of 18 found out that his headaches were due to myopia and were cured by wearing glasses. Then, while his father was on holiday, he did a good deal for the business; his reward of £100 allowed him to study at evening classes in Leeds, and qualify as an accountant. By 1927, aged 21, he was a partner in an accountancy firm, the director of two manufacturing companies, and had written a book on company financing. He joined the Liberal Party, having already, aged just 17, shared a platform with David Lloyd George. He was the Liberal candidate for the Bramley ward in the 1927 Leeds City Council election. He failed to be elected, but was offered three Parliamentary candidatures for the 1929 General Election. However, he decided to study for the Bar rather than stand for Parliament. In 1931 he went to London to complete his legal studies. He was called to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1932. Lightman had trouble in his early legal career because he had not been to university and was Jewish (it was then not fashionable among smart firms of London solicitors to brief Jewish barristers, particularly those from recent immigrant families). However, he overcame these handicaps by great determination and a considerable knowledge of accounts. The latter enabled him, while still a pupil, to help the head of his chambers at 1 New Square, Alexander Grant QC, who was so impressed with Lightman's advice that he invited him to stay on as a member of chambers. He stayed for 10 years until Grant's death in 1942, when he moved to 13 Old Square, headed by Reginald Goff QC, later a Lord Justice of Appeal. During World War II, Lightman served in the Home Guard; he was awarded a Defence medal in 1946. His practice continued to grow after the war. His work, due to his knowledge of accountancy, was largely in the fields of company law and insolvency, but in all fields he was well regarded by his solicitor clients and his fellow barristers as someone who always gave his work the detailed care and attention it needed and whose advocacy was sound and reliable. He had been writing articles for legal magazines and in 1945 he co-authored the 40th edition of Gore Browne, Company Law and Emergency War Regulation. Lightman became a QC in 1955. In 1960, he was elected a Liveryman of the Glovers' Company. In 1962 he was appointed a bencher of Lincoln's Inn and was elected to the Council of the Anglo-Jewish Association. In 1966 he became head of his chambers, one of the first Jews to hold such a position. He was involved in the first ever case in which an Appeal Court judge heard a case outside London - Lord Justice Romer heard it at his home in Kent. However, Lightman may be best remembered for his defence in 1965 of a deserted wife when Lord Denning ruled (in National Provincial Bank v Ainsworth) that a bank could not oust her from the matrimonial home even although her husband had defaulted on a mortgage. (The House of Lords reversed Lord Denning's decision.) Lightman's career was cut short in 1967, when he suffered a stroke; although with great determination he taught himself to write with his left hand, he was unable to resume his practice. He and his wife continued to live in a flat in Lincoln's Inn where he was able to enjoy the company of his friends: his great geniality made him a popular member. His uncle Victor was the second Jewish Justice of the Peace (JP) in Leeds and President of the Leeds Jewish Board of Guardian. In 1936, he married Gwendoline Joan Ostrer, of the family which controlled the Gaumont Film Company. They had three sons:Stuart Lightman; Sir Gavin Lightman, a High Court judge and Professor Stafford Lightman. His grandson, Daniel Lightman, is also a barrister. Obituaries in",Normal

"Countess Juliane of Nassau-Siegen (3September 1587 – 15February 1643), German: Juliana Gräfin von Nassau-Siegen, official titles: Gräfin zu Nassau, Katzenelnbogen, Vianden und Diez, Frau zu Beilstein, was a countess from the House of Nassau-Siegen, a cadet branch of the Ottonian Line of the House of Nassau, and through marriage landgravine of Hesse-Kassel. Juliane was born at Dillenburg Castle on 3September 1587 as the fifth child and second daughter of Count JohnVII the Middle of Nassau-Siegen and his first wife, Countess Magdalene of Waldeck-Wildungen. Juliane was brought up in the strict Calvinist tradition, but was also taught old and new languages. In addition to her siblings, the stepbrothers and -sisters from her mother's first marriage also lived in the child-rich household at Dillenburg Castle. The marriage of her eldest stepbrother, Count Philip LouisII of Hanau-Münzenberg, to Countess Catherine Belgica of Nassau, a daughter of Prince WilliamI the Silent of Orange, was also celebrated here in 1596, a festive highlight of Juliana's childhood. In February 1603, only three months after the death of his first wife Agnes of Solms-Laubach, Landgrave Maurice of Hesse-Kassel made a marriage proposal to the fifteen-year-old Juliane. The marriage took place three months later at Dillenburg Castle. Through his marriage to Juliane, Maurice's religious policy was influenced as he forged the closest of alliances with the House of Nassau-Siegen, which practised an outspoken Calvinist policy in the Holy Roman Empire. In domestic politics, Juliane strengthened the weight of the Calvinist party in Kassel, thus sharpening Maurice's aversion to the nobility, which was already dissatisfied with his policies. Soon after his marriage, the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel was considered in imperial politics as a protagonist of the Calvinist cause, alongside the Electoral Palatinate, who also belonged to the relatives of the House of Nassau. Despite her Calvinist upbringing, Juliane led a fairly representative court life with Maurice, but she always valued her financial independence and kept careful track of her expenses. As Maurice had three sons from his first marriage, Juliane soon sought to pass on income and property rights to her children. In the autumn of 1623, troops of the Catholic League under Tilly were quartered in Hesse-Kassel. Maurice's diplomatic trips to the Protestant courts in Northern Germany were, despite the hectic schedule, clearly escapist. Not only the Hessian estates of the realm, but also Juliane publicly accused him of having led the country to ruin and then abandoned it. When the estates independently entered into negotiations with Tilly to obtain the withdrawal of the troops of the Catholic League or at least a reduction in the war burden, Maurice accused them of treason. The breach that thus occurred was definitive. The estates, the councillors and Juliane in particular urged Maurice to resign from government. On 17March 1627, he was forced to resign in favour of his son WilliamV. Prior to this, Juliane had managed to secure a quarter of Hesse-Kassel –the so-called Rotenburger Quart– for her and her children in the House Treaty of 12February 1627, in order to secure their income. From this quarter, after her sons Herman and Frederick died without heirs, emerged the cadet branch Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg, founded by Landgrave Ernest. In the family conflict with Maurice, who fought with her over money, household goods and the education of the children, Juliane first defended her own interests and then those of her children, but without coming to a confrontation with her stepson, the ruling Landgrave WilliamV. But she was also very active in the conflict within her own Nassau-Siegen family. She stood up for the Calvinists in the county of Nassau-Siegen who suffered from the recatholicisation attempts of her brother JohnVIII the Younger, who had converted to the Catholic Church and was in Spanish service. Juliane was able to put her interest in state administration into practice after she had gained the relevant knowledge in the Rotenburger Quart, which she initially managed together with her eldest son Herman. When Maurice had to resign, Juliane initially stayed at Kassel Castle and moved with her children to Rotenburg an der Fulda in 1629, while Maurice lived first in Frankfurt and later in Eschwege. Faced with the threat of war, Juliane again sought brief shelter at Kassel Castle in 1631 and then lived until her death in the Nassauer Hof at the River Fulda, later called Packhof vor der Schlagd, which Maurice had already given her in 1617. Juliane was self-confident even in foreign policy; she attended the Electors' Day in Mulhouse in 1627 and contributed to the rapprochement between the branches Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt in the so-called 'Main Agreement'. Of far-reaching significance was the contact with Sweden that she initiated in 1630 through the mediation of her relatives from the House of Orange-Nassau, which led to the Swedish-Hessian Covenant of Werben in the following year, firmly binding the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel to Sweden. Juliane died in Eschwege on 15February 1643. She was buried in Kassel on 23March 1643. Adolphus Fabritius wrote a Leichenpredigt for her, which was published in Kassel in 1643. Juliane married Landgrave Maurice of Hesse-Kassel (Kassel, 25May 1572 – Eschwege, 15March 1632). The Beilager took place at Dillenburg Castle on 21May 1603Jul. and the Heimführung in Kassel on 4June 1603Jul.. From this marriage, the following children were born: Juliane has many known descendants. All reigning European monarchs, with the exception of the Fürst of Liechtenstein, are descendants of her.

"Rubens ""Rubinho"" Gonçalves Barrichello (Portuguese pronunciation: ; born 23 May 1972) is a Brazilian professional racing driver who competed in Formula One between 1993 and 2011. He scored 11 Grand Prix wins and 68 podiums. As of 2023, he competes full-time in the Brazilian Stock Car Pro Series, driving the No. 111 Toyota Corolla E210 for Full Time Sports. Following stints with the Jordan and Stewart teams, Barrichello drove for Ferrari from 2000 to 2005 as Michael Schumacher's teammate, finishing as championship runner-up in 2002 and 2004, and third in 2001, while contributing to five constructors' titles for the team. At the end of 2005 Barrichello left Ferrari to drive for Honda. In 2009, he finished third in the Drivers' Championship for Brawn GP, as his teammate Jenson Button won the driver's championship, and the team won the constructors' title. He was also appointed chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association in 2010. After two years with the Williams F1 team, Barrichello moved to the IndyCar Series in 2012 with KV Racing Technology. After only one year and being unable to find a ride for the 2013 season, he moved back to Brazil to participate in the Stock Car Series, winning the championship in 2014 and 2022. From 2013 until 2014 he covered F1 race weekends for Brazil's TV Globo, interviewing drivers and team members on the grid and commentating during qualifying and race coverage. He later left to co-host and star in the YouTube channel Acelerados. The paternal side of his family comes from Veneto, Italy (from the town of Riese, in the province of Treviso). His maternal side of the family is of Portuguese origin. Both his father and paternal grandfather are also named Rubens, and Barrichello shares his father's birthday: 23 May. Therefore, Rubens Barrichello was known as Rubinho (Portuguese for ""little Rubens""), which has become his nickname. Barrichello won five karting titles in Brazil before going to Europe to race in the Formula Vauxhall Lotus series in 1990. In his first year, he won the championship, a feat he replicated the following year in the British Formula 3 Championship, beating David Coulthard. He very nearly joined Formula One, the highest category of single seater racing, at just 19 years of age. Instead he competed in Formula 3000 in 1992. He finished third in the championship, and joined the Jordan Formula One team for the 1993 Formula One season. During this time, and also early in his Formula One career, Barrichello lived in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, UK. In Barrichello's third race, the European Grand Prix, he started from 12th place in very wet conditions but was fourth by the end of the first lap. He ran as high as second and was running third, having passed the Williams of Damon Hill and Alain Prost, before encountering a fuel pressure problem. His Jordan's reliability in 1993 was poor, and he finished few races. Barrichello regularly outpaced his more experienced teammates, Ivan Capelli and Thierry Boutsen. In the French Grand Prix, he almost scored his first Grand Prix point (and the team's first that year) but Michael Andretti passed him on the final lap for the sixth and final points-scoring position. His only points finish of the season came at the Japanese Grand Prix with fifth place, ahead of his new teammate Eddie Irvine. These 2 points put him in 18th place in the standings. 1994 started with a fourth place in Brazil and a third place at Aida, which was his first podium finish. These results put Barrichello in second place in the drivers' ranking, behind Michael Schumacher, who had won the two races. However, at the San Marino Grand Prix, he suffered a violent crash during Friday practice, hitting the wall at the Variante Bassa and flipping the car. The accident knocked him unconscious and threatened his life, with his tongue blocking his airway. Barrichello credited the on-track work of Sid Watkins for saving his life. The race weekend saw a succession of serious accidents, of which two were fatal: Roland Ratzenberger died during Saturday's qualifying session when he crashed his Simtek at the curva Villeneuve, while on Sunday, during the race, Barrichello's mentor Ayrton Senna crashed his Williams at Tamburello and also died. Barrichello was deeply affected by the deaths. Later in the season, he took pole position at the Belgian Grand Prix, and led some laps at Estoril. His pole position at Spa-Francorchamps set the record for the youngest driver to secure pole position at that time. He concluded the season with fourth place in Adelaide. He finished the season sixth overall in the Drivers' Championship with 19 points, outscoring Irvine, who scored six. During the 1995 season, Barrichello scored a second-place finish in Montreal, but the Jordan cars were less reliable than in 1994 mostly because Jordan took over the works Peugeot engine contract from the McLaren team. In three races he lost seven points on the final lap—a high-speed collision with Mark Blundell at Silverstone, and mechanical failures at Barcelona and in Hungary. Barrichello finished the season in 11th with 11 points, one ahead of Irvine. There were high hopes for 1996. The Benson & Hedges cigarette brand brought an infusion of sponsorship to the team. Barrichello was amongst the frontrunners in Brazil, the second race of the season, before spinning off after his brakes overheated. However, as the season progressed, Jordan became less competitive. Barrichello's relationship with team owner Eddie Jordan soured during 1996, and at the end of the year, after being linked to strong teams, including Benetton (the seat was later filled by Gerhard Berger due to the Austrian bringing in more sponsorship), he left for the newly formed Stewart Grand Prix. His final season at Jordan resulted in 14 points. Stewart's debut season in 1997 saw frequent reliability problems, and Barrichello finished only three races. The highlight was a second-place finish in Monaco, which put him 13th in the standings. Teammate Jan Magnussen scored no points. The same year, Barrichello married Silvana Giaffone on 24 February. She is a cousin of Brazilian Indy Car driver Felipe Giaffone and a niece of the Stock Car Brasil champions, Affonso Giaffone Filho and Zeca Giaffone. 1998 was not much better for Stewart, with two fifth places being the team's best results. Despite the poor reliability of the team, Barrichello consistently beat teammate Magnussen, which resulted in the latter being dropped at the French Grand Prix, replaced by Jos Verstappen, another teammate beaten by Barrichello. 1999 was a much better year for the Stewart team. Barrichello qualified third at his home race in Brazil, outpacing Michael Schumacher's Ferrari, and led some laps, until his engine blew near 'Subida dos Boxes'. He also took pole position in the wet qualifying session in France, and three podium finishes, at the San Marino, French, and European Grands Prix. The latter race was won by his teammate Johnny Herbert. Despite this, Barrichello again generally outpaced his teammate. Over the course of the year, he caught the eye of Ferrari boss Jean Todt, and he was signed for the 2000 season. In 2000, Barrichello achieved his first Grand Prix victory at the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, when he and the team chose to stay on dry-weather tyres when it was raining on part of the circuit. This risky call saw him leap-frog the McLarens who chose to pit for wet weather tyres to win the race, having started from 18th on the grid. This was the longest any driver in Formula One history had waited for a maiden Grand Prix win at the time. Barrichello had a consistent debut season for Ferrari, finishing most races on the podium, but was outscored by Michael Schumacher, Mika Häkkinen and David Coulthard. Barrichello finished the season ranked fourth after supporting Schumacher as he battled and defeated Häkkinen for the Drivers' Championship, and helping Ferrari win the Constructors' Championship. Barrichello finished the 2001 season in third place, achieving a total of 10 podium finishes and scoring a total of 56 championship points. He nearly achieved a win in Monza, in which the Ferrari pit crew performed badly. He finished the season winless, and again he played a major supporting role for Schumacher, helping him win his second Drivers' Championship with Ferrari and helping the team win the Constructors' Championship for the third consecutive year. Barrichello's success at Ferrari continued in 2002, when he won four races for the team and finished a career-best second place in the Drivers' Championship, scoring 77 championship points. The year was marked by controversy, however, when Ferrari team orders required Barrichello to allow the trailing Schumacher to pass him on the final straight of the Austrian Grand Prix to take victory. Schumacher exchanged podium places with Barrichello at the podium ceremony and gave Barrichello the winner's trophy. The drivers were fined for disrupting podium protocol and Ferrari's blatant team orders led to the FIA banning team orders beginning in 2003. Barrichello finished the 2003 season in fourth place, scoring 65 points, including wins at Silverstone and Suzuka, and again played a crucial role in helping Schumacher and Ferrari win the drivers' and Constructors' Championships. In the 2004 season, Barrichello finished second behind Schumacher in only seven of the first thirteen races, but he won both the 2004 Italian Grand Prix and the 2004 Chinese Grand Prix to clinch second place in the championship, finishing the year with 114 points and 14 podiums. Though Barrichello had good cars during his Ferrari era, his best result at his home race was a third place in 2004. He failed to finish eleven of the fifteen Brazilian Grands Prix in which he has competed. In the 2005 season, Ferrari lacked the pace of previous years because of the changing of tyre rules. Ferrari used Bridgestone tyres, which were less effective than those of their competitors Michelin. Barrichello's best results this season were two second places in Melbourne and then at the United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis, when all the Michelin-running cars retired after the formation lap, leaving only six cars in the race. He finished the season in eighth place in the drivers' standings with 38 points, his worst season with Ferrari. In an August 2022 interview with Felipe Massa, he states that Barrichello had a contract with Ferrari running until 2006, after which he was to be replaced with Kimi Raikkonen for the 2007 season. But in early 2005, Honda had approached him to drive for them, and unhappy with the treatment Ferrari had given him, decided to ask the team to terminate his contract in 2005. He was thus replaced by Felipe for the 2006 season. In August 2005 he announced that he would be leaving Ferrari at the end of the year to join Honda. Barrichello's lucky number is ""11,"" which was the number his kart bore when he won his first race. In 2006, his new teammate Jenson Button gave Barrichello the number for his car in goodwill. Barrichello was initially outpaced by Button, and claimed that the car did not suit his driving style, particularly under braking. After modifications to the car he was able to be more competitive. In Monaco, he nearly got his first podium with the team, but then he was given a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane and finished fourth. Though he lost a podium, it was the best result at the Monaco Grand Prix for Honda (as a team) or any Japanese team. For the race Barrichello exchanged helmet liveries with Tony Kanaan, a Brazilian Indy Car driver and one of his best friends. On the same weekend, Kanaan raced in the 2006 Indianapolis 500 race using Barrichello's helmet livery. Barrichello qualified third for the Chinese Grand Prix, ahead of Schumacher and Räikkönen. He finished the season seventh in the drivers' standings with 30 points, 26 behind Button. Barrichello did not score any points during the 2007 season, because of the Honda RA107's lack of pace. Despite retiring only twice, a ninth place in the British Grand Prix was his best result of the season and he only once qualified in the top 10. Despite this, Honda confirmed on 19 July 2007, that Barrichello would remain with the team as a race driver for the 2008 season. This gave him the opportunity of making the five race starts he required to break Riccardo Patrese's record for the driver that has started the most Grands Prix, a record that had stood for 14 years. In the first race of the 2008 season, Barrichello qualified 10th, ahead of Button. He finished 6th but was disqualified for ignoring a red light at the pit exit. He also received a stop-and-go penalty during the race for entering the pits while they were closed during a safety car period. In Malaysia, gearbox problems limited his performance and he finished 13th. In Bahrain he again finished out of the points. The Turkish Grand Prix was Barrichello's 257th Grand Prix, breaking Patrese's record of 256 Grand Prix starts and becoming the most experienced driver in F1 history. The particular Grand Prix at which he broke this record has been disputed, as he technically did not start some races, such as the 2002 Spanish Grand Prix, but Barrichello and Honda chose Turkey to be the location of the official celebrations. In Monaco, he scored his first points since 2006 and in Canada he scored consecutive points, finishing 7th after starting in 9th position. He led some laps because of the appearance of the safety car, but fell back down the order towards the end of the race. At Magny-Cours, Barrichello did not repeat his performance from the two previous races and qualified in 17th. After a gearbox change, he dropped to 20th. In the race, he finished 14th. At Silverstone, which he said he considers to be his second home, he qualified 16th, outpacing Button. With heavy rain on race day, through good use of an extreme wet tyre he finished 3rd, achieving his first podium since 2005. However, in Germany, a collision with David Coulthard ended his hopes for points. In Hungary, he was lapped by the leader, repeating the same performance in Valencia. In Belgium he qualified 16th but had to retire because of a gearbox fault. At a wet Monza, he was second-fastest in Friday practice and started from 16th on the grid. He managed to get up to 9th but as a result of using the wrong type of tyre in his second pit stop he ended up 17th. At the first ever night race in Singapore he was in a good position to score some points after pitting before the pit lane closed for the safety car period, but shortly afterwards the engine failed and he had to retire. In Japan he started from 17th on the grid, but managed to get up to 13th by the end of the race. In China he managed to get into Q2 for the first time in ten races, and would have started 14th. But after Mark Webber had his ten place penalty for an engine change added he was moved up to 13th. On race day he had a good start, and got up to 10th early on and held a strong mid-table position all race and finished 11th, five places ahead of Button, who had struggled all weekend. At his home Grand Prix in Brazil, he was sporting an alternative helmet design in tribute to Ingo Hoffmann, and finished 15th. On 5 December 2008 Honda announced that they were quitting F1, because of the economic crisis. This led to months of uncertainty as to whether a buyer could be found, and whether they would retain Barrichello. Just weeks before the season opener in Melbourne, team manager Ross Brawn purchased the Honda team, renaming it Brawn GP and removing the threat of possible closure. Barrichello was the subject of persistent rumours suggesting he would lose his seat to the young Bruno Senna, nephew of his friend, idol and mentor Ayrton Senna. Ultimately Brawn elected to retain Barrichello to partner Jenson Button in 2009. At Barcelona during the final pre-season test, both Barrichello and Button surprised the paddock with extremely competitive lap times, outperforming others by as much as two seconds, and foreshadowing the performance the team would show in the early races. In Melbourne, Barrichello topped the timesheets in the first two elements of qualifying, but qualified second on the grid behind teammate Button. Despite a poor start caused by his engine slipping into anti-stall, he did well to recover and lost only a couple of positions at the start. However, he sustained damage to the front wing and rear diffuser in the first corner incident when he was bumped from behind by Heikki Kovalainen in his McLaren that saw him hit Mark Webber in the Red Bull damaging Webber's car as well as his hopes of a good finish. Despite this, Barrichello ultimately finished the race in second place after Sebastian Vettel and Robert Kubica collided with just 2 laps remaining. He started eighth in Malaysia after getting a grid penalty for a gearbox change and finished the race in fifth place after the race was abandoned at Sepang due to heavy rain. At Shanghai, he outpaced Button in qualifying, but struggled with his car's brakes when one of them stopped working in the first stint and finished in fourth, recording the race's fastest lap. In Bahrain, his front wing adjustor failed during his qualifying run thereby compromising his aggressive 3-pit-stop race strategy, and thus managed only fifth place. He qualified third on the grid for the Spanish Grand Prix, but overtook Button and second place man Vettel on the first straight, to lead the race in the first corner. He was unable to capitalise on his three-stop strategy as a result of a lack of pace caused by massive amounts of understeer on his third set of tyres in his third stint, finishing behind Button, who changed to a 2-stop strategy during the race. At Monaco, Barrichello was pipped for pole by a late-charging Button and Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen. A good start saw him leapfrog the Finn into Sainte Devote. Barrichello's supersoft tyres did not last as well as Button's in the first stint and he pitted earlier than planned, and Button took a commanding lead. The top three remained unchanged for the duration of the race, save some reshuffling during the pit stop windows. At the completion of lap 47, Barrichello became the driver who has completed most laps in Formula One history, surpassing Michael Schumacher's total of 13,909 laps. In Turkey, he again had gearbox problems and retired for the first time in the season, leaving Button to increase his points advantage, while in Britain, Barrichello qualified second behind Vettel, before beating Button for the first time in 2009 en route to third place. In Germany, Barrichello took the lead at the first corner but after his first stop, he came out behind Felipe Massa who held him up. A fuel rig problem during his second stop meant that he finished the race in sixth, a place behind teammate Jenson Button. After the race he publicly blamed Brawn GP saying ""It was a good show from the team in how to lose a race"" and ""They made me lose the race"". Team principal Ross Brawn said of the incident ""He had the 11th-fastest time of the race. You can't win a race with that speed"". However, he refused to criticize Barrichello for his outburst. Barrichello has since admitted he overreacted, and he would not have won as the Red Bull cars were half a second a lap quicker than him. In Hungary, the Brawn cars struggled and lacked pace because of problems with the tyres and aerodynamics. Barrichello finished 10th, his first finish outside the points in 2009, and three places behind Button. In Valencia, Barrichello took his 10th Grand Prix win, his first in five years and the 100th win by a Brazilian driver in Formula One, allowing him to move up to 2nd in the Championship. He paid tribute to injured compatriot Felipe Massa with a plaque on the top of his race helmet. At Spa, he qualified 4th, but suffered from anti-stall for the third time in 2009 and he found himself last, but missed the first lap crash which took out four drivers including teammate Button. While the safety car was out he pitted and changed strategy which enabled him to climb back up to 7th. During the last three laps the car had an engine oil leak, but he still managed to finish, before his car caught fire in the pit lane after the race. At Monza, he qualified 5th, despite carrying more fuel to try a different strategy with only one stop. After passing Kovalainen at the start, Barrichello managed not to lose too much time, as he had the advantage of just one stop against Hamilton, Räikkönen and Sutil's two-stop strategy. By Hamilton's second pit stop, Button and Barrichello were running first and second. Hamilton tried to pressure Button by forcing his car, but on the last lap he crashed, giving third place to Räikkönen, and fourth to Sutil. Barrichello won the 11th race in his Formula One career, and gained more points on Button in their fight for the world title. In Singapore, he had to change his gearbox and take a five place grid penalty. During qualifying he crashed his car while in fifth place. As a result of Nick Heidfeld starting from the pitlane, Barrichello would start 9th and finished sixth, while Button finished fifth. In Japan, he originally qualified 5th, but was given a five place grid penalty for failing to slow down during a yellow flag situation near the end of Q2 when Sébastien Buemi crashed. He was on course to finish fifth with Button behind, which would have been enough for Brawn GP to clinch the Constructors' Championship, but a safety car period in the closing stages of the race for Jaime Alguersuari's crash meant that Nico Rosberg and Heidfeld were able to stay out ahead and save fuel, dropping Barrichello to seventh. With Button finishing eighth, Barrichello closed the points deficit to fourteen and putting Brawn almost out of reach for the Constructors' title. In Brazil, Barrichello claimed pole in a rain-soaked, qualifying session with title rivals Button and Vettel down the order in 14th and 16th, respectively. A puncture cost Barrichello a chance of taking the title to the final race, as he failed to secure enough of an advantage over Button to do so. Button finished fifth to become champion. In Abu Dhabi he qualified and finished 4th. With Vettel winning the race, he secured second in the standings, with Barrichello finishing third in the championship with 77 points. In 2010, Barrichello was offered a contract by McLaren. He did not accept because he had already signed a contract with Williams, and did not want to renege on his pledge to that team. The McLaren seat was ultimately filled by Barrichello's 2009 teammate Jenson Button. On 2 November 2009, Williams confirmed Barrichello and Nico Hülkenberg as their official race drivers for the 2010 season. This meant that Barrichello would be in Formula One for at least another season, and would go on to become the first driver in Formula One history to compete in over 300 Grands Prix. In pre-season testing, Barrichello finished at the top of the timesheets once, because of rain. In some sessions, he was outpaced by his rookie teammate Hülkenberg. Williams was the second team in terms of kilometres covered and showed some reliability, but were off pace from front-runners Red Bull, Ferrari, and McLaren. At the first race of the season in Bahrain, Barrichello qualified eleventh on the grid, and finished tenth in the race. In Australia, he went on to finish eighth, moving him to within two points of Senna's mark. He stalled on the grid in Malaysia due to an overheating clutch, but recovered to twelfth place at the finish. In China, he finished twelfth again. In Spain he benefited from Lewis Hamilton's late crash to score two points, finishing in 9th, despite starting 18th on the grid and equalling Senna's record. In Monaco, he qualified ninth and moved up to sixth position through the first corner. Later, he had a suspension failure caused by a loose drain cover and crashed heavily. After crashing he threw the car's steering wheel out, as he was sitting in the middle of a 120mph corner with his car on fire. This was then run over by Karun Chandhok's Hispania. At the Turkish Grand Prix, he qualified fifteenth. Due to an overheating clutch at the start, he dropped down to 20th position. A poor pit stop failed to help his cause and he finished in fourteenth position. It was similar at the Canadian Grand Prix, when Barrichello again finished in fourteenth. He qualified eleventh, narrowly missing Q3 but his anti-stall system kicked in at the start of the race. After recovering well, he later collided with Jaime Alguersuari when Alguersuari came across too late to cover his line, the damage blocking Barrichello's left brake duct. In Valencia, the Williams team brought big upgrades and ran their version of the F-duct. Barrichello qualified ninth with the same time as his teammate Hülkenberg. He was running seventh when the safety car was deployed at the end of lap nine, and pulled straight into the pits. When the safety car pitted he was able to fend off Kubica to finish fourth, his highest finish so far of the season. Post-race, nine cars were investigated for speeding under the safety car, and were later given a five-second penalty. This made no difference to Barrichello's position, and he became the highest-scoring Brazilian driver in Formula One history, overhauling Ayrton Senna's career tally of 614 points, that Barrichello had been tied on since the Spanish Grand Prix. He added further points to his total with fifth at Silverstone, and tenth in Hungary, with a twelfth at Hockenheim in between. Barrichello celebrated his 300th Grand Prix at the Belgian Grand Prix, but retired in damp conditions after colliding with Fernando Alonso's Ferrari on the first lap. Before the race, he was elected as Chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association to replace the outgoing Nick Heidfeld. At Monza, he qualified in tenth, and had a rather lonely run in the race to finish in the same place to score another point. In Singapore, the FW32 sported a new front wing, and Barrichello put this to good use to set the sixth fastest time in qualifying, although Williams technical director Sam Michael reckoned the car was fast enough to be a couple of positions higher. In the race despite losing places to Robert Kubica and Nico Rosberg at the start, Barrichello had a solid run to sixth at the finish. In Japan, he qualified in a strong seventh, he raced strongly before fading to ninth as he was overtaken by the two Saubers towards the closing stages of the race. In Korea he qualified tenth despite being blocked by Michael Schumacher. In a wet race he suffered heavy tyre wear on the intermediates that he was running on, and in the closing stages of the race he was passed by Robert Kubica and Vitantonio Liuzzi, dropping him to seventh place at the finish. At Interlagos he qualified a strong sixth in variable conditions with teammate Hülkenberg starting from pole position. After a delayed pitstop, his traditional bad luck on home soil returned when he suffered a puncture after briefly colliding with Jaime Alguersuari, costing him any chance of scoring points. In Abu Dhabi he again qualified strongly in seventh place, and maintained that position shortly after the start. However, when the safety car was deployed following Michael Schumacher's and Vitantonio Liuzzi's crash, many drivers like Robert Kubica, Vitaly Petrov and Nico Rosberg took advantage of this by pitting early. This had a negative effect as they did not need to pit again, and Barrichello finished outside of the points. On 15 November 2010, Williams confirmed Barrichello as one of the team's drivers for the 2011 season. His teammate in 2011 was Pastor Maldonado. In Australia he retired with a transmission problem. He retired again in Malaysia with leaking hydraulics. He finished outside the points in the next three races before a pair of ninth places in Monaco and Canada. He came twelfth in Valencia, and thirteenth in Britain, but retired in Germany because of an oil leak. After that, he finished every race outside the points, but made no further retirements. His final race at the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix was a quiet farewell where he finished 14th, ahead of former teammate Michael Schumacher. In a 2022 interview, Barrichello revealed he was fired by Frank Williams through a phone call in early January 2012, and on 17 January 2012, Williams confirmed that Bruno Senna would replace Barrichello at Williams for the 2012 season. Senna was chosen due to his financial backing. Former Caterham F1 team principal Manfredi Ravetto said in an interview that a contract was signed with Barrichello to replace Kamui Kobayashi for the final three races of the season, providing the car would be competitive. It was not, and the Caterham team went into administration, so Barrichello did not join the team. On 25 January 2012, American journalist Robin Miller reported that Barrichello was to test an IndyCar for KV Racing Technology with friend Tony Kanaan. The test was held at Sebring over 30–31 January and 1 February. He also tested for the team at Infineon Raceway in late February. On 1 March 2012 Barrichello joined KV Racing Technology for the 2012 season, to drive the team's number eight entry alongside Kanaan and E. J. Viso, sponsored by Brazilian construction company, Embrase. Barrichello raced in his first Indianapolis 500 on 27 May 2012. He led a total of two laps and finished 11th, and in doing so won the 2012 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year title. During the rest of the season he took two top six finishes, and finished the year in 12th position in the championship. Barrichello joined a Peugeot team of the Brazilian racing series Stock Car Brasil (now called Stock Car Pro Series) for the final three races of the 2012 season as a guest driver. Since 2013 he drives a Chevrolet as a regular member of the Full Time Sports team. Since Nonô Figueiredo already used the number 11, Barrichello's lucky number, he chose 111 instead. In the 2013 season, he finished the season in 8th place overall, with a best race result was a second-place finish. Continuing to drive a Chevrolet for Full Time Sports in 2014, Barrichello was crowned the 2014 champion, winning two races and securing a further 4 podium finishes. This was Barrichello's first championship in 23 years, dating back to his 1991 British Formula 3 title. In 2015, Barrichello finished in 4th place overall. In 2016 he claimed three wins and nine podiums, finishing second overall behind Felipe Fraga. He finished 5th in 2017, 4th in 2018, 5th in 2019, 6th in 2020 and 2021, earning at least one individual win each year. In 2022 he won the series for the second time with three victories in the individual races. In 2020, Toyota sent him to Argentina to compete in the Super TC 2000 and Top Race V6 championships. Barrichello's helmet is white with an orange-red oval shape on the rear, an orange-red shape around the visor, an orange red line under the helmet and a blue circle on the top with azure and sky blue cylinders—similar to those on the helmet of former world champion Emerson Fittipaldi—with a golden star in the middle (usually five-pointed, although the recent designs had it six-pointed). The white part of the helmet changed to silver for some races during the 1999 season. After signing for Ferrari in 2000, teammate Michael Schumacher changed the colours of his helmet at the Monaco Grand Prix to avoid confusion, since the two drivers' original helmet colours were identical (the only real difference being that Schumacher's helmet had a red band which wrapped around its back from the visor, fading into gold and back). At the 2001 Brazilian Grand Prix, the oval shape and the shape around the visor were painted to resemble the Brazilian flag, and at his 300th Grand Prix, his helmet once again carried the Brazilian flag colours. At the 2006 Monaco Grand Prix he had the helmet livery of fellow Brazilian and good friend Tony Kanaan, who in turn had Barrichello's helmet livery while racing in 2006 Indianapolis 500 which was held on the same day because they said it would be the closest either of them would get to competing in the biggest race of the year of the category the other raced in. At the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, Barrichello drove with a helmet in tribute to Ingo Hoffmann, former F1 driver and multiple Stock Car Brasil champion who was retiring that year. At the 1995 and 2011 Brazilian Grands Prix, he wore a helmet painted to include elements of his own helmet design, and the classic design of Ayrton Senna's helmet. During the 2009 season he used the Brawn GP fluorescent colours on his helmet. † As Barrichello was a guest driver, he was ineligible to score points. * Season still in progress.

Barrichello formerly held the fastest time by a Formula One driver around the Top Gear test track during the show's Star in a Reasonably Priced Car segment. His lap time of 1:44.3 put him ahead of the Stig by 0.1 seconds. This led to Jeremy Clarkson making frequent references to the Stig developing a deep-seated hatred of Barrichello. In February 2018, Barrichello was rushed to hospital after suffering headaches where it was discovered that he had a benign tumour which was later removed. On F1's podcast, ""Beyond The Grid"", he revealed he got divorced in 2019.

"Gutnau Priory, also spelled Guttnau or Guttenau (German: Kloster Gutnau, Guttnau or Guttenau), was a small Benedictine nunnery in Neuenburg am Rhein, in the district Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald in Baden-Württemberg in southern Germany. According to Caspar Molitor, abbot of St. Blaise's Abbey, the nunnery was founded in 1181 by Guta, sister and heiress of the last lord of Au (Auggen, Owon), on and with her inheritance; Guta was a nun of Sitzenkirch Priory, which was subordinate to St. Blaise's. The nunnery buildings were apparently first sited right on the bank of the river Rhine, but were later relocated further inland for fear of flooding. In 1260 nuns from Sitzenkirch moved to Gutnau without the permission of the abbot of Saint Blaise's, but were made to return to Sitzenkirch in 1261. By the 15th century the community had become very impoverished. In 1423 the premises burned down to the ground, and there were not enough funds for more than an inadequate reconstruction. By 1492 the monastery was no longer able to finance itself and became a subordinate provostry of St. Blaise's Abbey. There were only two nuns in 1513. In 1525 the nunnery was plundered and laid waste in the Peasants' War, although according to Caspar Molitor a community of some sort was resident in 1530. It is presumed to have been dissolved during the Reformation in 1556. St. Blaise's Abbey retained the lands for some years. By 1630 they had passed to Bürgeln Priory, and by 1657 to that of Krozingen. Such buildings as remained were destroyed by the French in 1675. In 1780 the last remaining property rights were sold. There are no surviving remains of the nunnery. 47°47′38″N 7°34′20″E﻿ ﻿47.7940°N 7.57214°E﻿ 47.7940; 7.57214",Normal
"James Espir (born 17 October 1958), is an English middle-distance runner, whose career spanned the late 1970s and early 1980s. Espir competed for Shaftesbury Harriers Athletics Club and for Great Britain. Son of neurologist Michael Lucien Ernest Espir (1926–2015) and Patricia (née Smouha), Espir was born into a secular Jewish family with athletic background; his maternal grandfather Edward Smouha won the bronze medal as a member of the Great Britain team in the 4 x 100 metre relay at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Espir's uncle Brian Smouha ran for Great Britain at sprint distances in the early 1960s, and his paternal grandfather Louis Espir ran a four-and-a-half minute mile in 1913. Espir was educated at Harrow School where he excelled at running. His talent attracted the attention of Harry Wilson, coach to the world's greatest miler at that time, Steve Ovett. Under Wilson's guidance, Espir embarked on a rigorous training schedule with Ovett and other world-class athletes, and competitive success soon followed. At the age of 18, Espir was the UK Junior 3000 metres champion both indoors and outdoors, and had already represented his country at senior international level. As a 21-year-old in 1980, he ran 1500 metres in 3 minutes 38.2 seconds, a time which would have stood as a British record ten years previously. The following year Espir ran a mile in 3 minutes 56.7 seconds, thereby becoming the fastest Jewish miler ever. In the 1981 Maccabiah Games in Tel Aviv, Israel, he won the 1500 metres and 5000 metres Gold Medals on successive days, and two days later set an Israeli All-comers' record at 1500 metres. Espir's winning times in the 1981 Maccabiah 1500 metres and 5000 metres finals remain, as at January 2023, the current Maccabiah Games records for those events. Espir's subsequent athletics career was frequently interrupted by injury. After one such lay-off he returned to running under a new coach, Alf Wilkins, and went on to retain his Maccabiah Games 1500 metres title in the 1985 Maccabiah Games. After this he retired from top-class athletics to pursue a career in banking. Espir continued to compete at club level as a member of Shaftesbury Harriers, at distances from 800 metres up to the Marathon. (In 1986, Shaftesbury Harriers amalgamated with Barnet Copthall Ladies Athletics Club to form Shaftesbury Barnet Harriers). Espir completed the 2004 London Marathon at the age of 45 in a time of 2 hours 47 minutes and 3 seconds, despite stumbling in slippery conditions around five miles from the finish and stress-fracturing his hip and four vertebrae of his back.",Normal
"""7 Summers"" is a song by American country music singer Morgan Wallen from his second studio album, Dangerous: The Double Album (2021). Wallen wrote the song along with Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne, and it was produced by Joey Moi. Wallen did not originally intend to include the song on the album, but following a demo version of the song gaining popularity on social media, he decided on its inclusion. The song was officially released as the second single of the album on August 14, 2020. A country and soft rock track, it features suspended chords and guitar layering. Lyrically, Wallen sings of his lost love and reminisces about their romance that took place, as the title suggests, seven summers ago. ""7 Summers"" received positive reviews from music critics, who praised Wallen's vocals, Moi's production, and its overall mood. Time would rank the song the seventh best of 2020. Upon its release, the song broke the single-day Apple Music streaming record for a country song. The song debuted at number one on Billboard's Hot Country Songs and number six on the Billboard Hot 100, making Wallen only the second solo male country artist to earn a Billboard top 10 debut, 21 years after Garth Brooks did so as Chris Gaines in 1999. It has since been certified triple platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Wallen would release a short film for the song and would later perform it as part of his appearance on Saturday Night Live. While at the beach with his children, songwriter Shane McAnally came up the idea of a song titled ""7 Summers"", as it was his seventh summer going to the beach with his family. He would pitch the title to Wallen who found the title to be interesting and would begin writing the song alongside McAnally and Josh Osborne, while bringing in Joey Moi to produce the song. During the COVID-19 quarantine, Wallen was nominated by fellow country musician Jake Owen to do a demo on Instagram; he accepted the challenge and performed what would become the song's first verse and chorus in April 2020. Wallen was initially uncertain whether the song would be included on his second album, however he changed his mind after the demo received positive feedback from fans and went viral on video-sharing app TikTok, earning over 24 million views prior to its official release. On August 4, in response to a fan who posted on TikTok that they were waiting for Wallen to release the song, he announced it would be released the following week. In a statement on the song's release, Wallen said: ""Social media played a huge part in me releasing this song, especially this early. It's a cool thing – me being on the fence about it, then being able to put it out and get people's feedback. Seeing the response played the biggest part in this release. I think that speaks to just how much fans mean to me and fans mean to music"". ""7 Summers"" has been described as a blend of 1980s style country music and soft rock, with Wallen stating that he was influenced by rock bands Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles, whom he grew up listening to with his father. While writing the song, song writer Shane McAnally sought to incorporate a wistfulness and bittersweet quality that would distinguish it from the more lighthearted songs that he typically wrote. Wallen would include experiences from his upbringing in the lyrics. The song contains ringing, suspended chords, and layered guitars meant to add a maximalist element, a ""shimmering mid-tempo groove"", and a ""breezy, island-influenced"" melody. Wallen's vocals are ""nostalgic"", ""bittersweet"", ""wistful"", and ""daydreamy"" as he reminisces on a lost summer romance that took place, as the title suggests, seven summers ago, while also pondering if his summer lover still thinks about ""that boy from East Tennessee"", referring to himself. His nostalgia takes him back to an unforgettable summer that is ""all too vivid"", with a ""time traveling chorus"" indicating a second chance with his former romance may be possible. The song was officially released on August 14, 2020, as the second single from Wallen's second studio album Dangerous: The Double Album. Upon its release, the song was met with positive reviews from music critics, with them praising Wallen's vocals, Moi's production, and the overall mood of the song. Billboard's Melinda Newman gave the song overall praise, calling it reminiscent of the easy listening music of the mid 20th century and stating: ""Wallen's wistful vocals, Joey Moi's pitch-perfect production and the yearning for a time and love long gone pack a gentle wallop"". Allie Clouse of the Knoxville News Sentinel deemed the song a ""nostalgic summer soundtrack"". Think Country Music's Jamie Gard declared it""the country soundtrack of the season"", opining that the song would captivate listeners with its ""irresistible sway"". CountrySwag's Erica Zisman described the song as ""having imagery like no other"". Rolling Stone's Jon Freeman called the song ""dreamy"", complimenting Moi's ""atmospheric"" production, stating that it ""perfectly fits the mood of Wallen's story"". At the years end, Time ranked it the seventh best song of 2020. Since its release, ""7 Summers"" has grown to be a fan favorite track and is frequently cited as being one of Wallen's best songs. On November 10, 2020, Wallen released an eight minute cinematic short film for the song directed by Justin Clough. Filmed in Nashville, the film features Wallen in his acting debut as a small town high school baseball star whose father pressures him to pursue a professional baseball career, while he fears that doing so might force him to leave behind his high school sweetheart. In the film, after failing to make the big leagues, Wallen returns to his hometown and discovers that his lost love has new life without him. The video was inspired by a period in Wallen's life in which he got injured playing baseball and struggled adjusting to community college, as well as by him reminiscing on old conversations with his high school girlfriend. The film received positive reviews, with reviewers praising Wallen's acting and its cinematic nature. The film also served to tease tease Dangerous: The Double Album, with him stating that the release date of the album could be found in the film. Fans spotted the numbers 1, 8, and 21 in the film, hinting at a release of January 8, 2021, the ultimate release date of the album. ""7 Summers"" set the record for the biggest first-day streams for a country song on Apple Music, garnering 4.6 million streams and debuting at number three on the global chart. It also broke Spotify's first day record for a country track by a solo artist. The song debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Wallen's first top 10 entry, as well as the second top 10 debut ever for a song by a solo male country artist, the first since Chris Gaines (Garth Brooks)' ""Lost in You"" in 1999. This also made Wallen the first contestant from The Voice to score a top 10 single. The song would peak at number three on the Rolling Stone Top 100, the highest charting solo country song in the charts history. The song peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart in February 2021, becoming Wallen's first single to miss the top 10 on the airplay chart since his debut single ""The Way I Talk"" peaked at number 30 in 2017. Its chart run was halted as a result of SiriusXM Satellite Radio, iHeartRadio, Entercom, and Cumulus Media all issuing directives to their stations to remove Wallen's music from airplay, following controversy after the singer was caught on camera using a racial slur with friends as they were entering his Nashville home. The song has been certified triple platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). ""7 Summers"" strong commercial performance was primarily driven by TikTok and streaming, a rare occurrence in country music which typically relies on radio airplay and physical sales more than other genres. The success of the song through streaming was cited by the Los Angeles Times as ""helping move country music into the 21st century"". Wallen first performed ""7 Summers"" live on September 10, 2020, in Austin, Texas as part of Tito's Handmade Vodka Presents: Made to Order Festival. On December 5, 2020, Wallen performed the song on his Saturday Night Live debut to an audience of 6.1 million viewers. On January 8, 2021, Wallen performed the song live on The Bobby Bones Show along with other songs on his album. Information taken from AllMusic.

"Basic Instinct is a 1992 neo-noir erotic thriller film directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe Eszterhas. Starring Michael Douglas, Sharon Stone, George Dzundza, Jeanne Tripplehorn, and Wayne Knight, the film follows San Francisco police detective Nick Curran (Douglas) as he investigates the brutal murder of a wealthy rock star. During the course of the investigation, Curran becomes entangled in a passionate and intense relationship with Catherine Tramell (Stone), an enigmatic writer and the prime suspect. The script for Basic Instinct was developed by Eszterhas in the 1980s, and it became the subject of a bidding war. Carolco Pictures secured the rights to the film and brought Verhoeven on board to direct. Stone was cast as Tramell after the role was rejected by several actresses. Production was plagued by protests and intense conflict between Eszterhas and Verhoeven. Basic Instinct premiered in Los Angeles on March 18, 1992, and was theatrically released in the United States by TriStar Pictures on March 20, 1992. The film received mixed reviews upon its release, with praise for the performances of the cast, score, and editing, while its writing and character development were criticized. It also generated controversy due to its sexually explicit content, violence, and depiction of homosexual relationships. Despite the public protest, Basic Instinct was a commercial success, grossing $352.9 million worldwide and becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 1992. Since its release, Basic Instinct has undergone a critical reevaluation. The film has been recognized for its groundbreaking depictions of sexuality in mainstream Hollywood cinema, and was described by one scholar as ""a neo-film noir masterpiece that plays with, and transgresses, the narrative rules of film noir."" Numerous versions of the film have been released on videocassette, laserdisc, DVD, and Blu-ray, including a director's cut with extended footage previously unseen in North American cinemas. A sequel, Basic Instinct 2, was released 14 years later in 2006. The film stars Stone, but was made without the involvement of Verhoeven or Douglas. It received negative reviews and was relatively unsuccessful. Homicide detective Nick Curran investigates the murder of retired rock star Johnny Boz in San Francisco. Boz was stabbed to death with an ice pick while having sex with a mysterious blonde woman. Nick's prime suspect is Boz's girlfriend, crime novelist Catherine Tramell, whose novel mirrors the crime. Catherine is uncooperative and taunts the investigators by smoking and exposing herself. Although she is released, Nick discovers that she has a history of befriending murderers. This includes Roxy Hardy, Catherine's girlfriend, who impulsively killed her two younger brothers at the age of 16, and Hazel Dobkins, who killed her husband and children. Nick, who accidentally shot two tourists while high on cocaine during an undercover assignment, attends counseling sessions with Police Psychologist Dr. Beth Garner. The two have an on-and-off affair. Nick discovers that Catherine is using him as the basis for the protagonist of her latest book, in which his character is murdered after falling for the wrong woman. He becomes suspicious that she has bribed Lt. Marty Nilsen for his psychiatric file. In response, Nick assaults Nilsen in his office. Nilsen is found murdered, and Nick is suspected and placed on leave. Nick and Catherine embark on a passionate but tense affair. One night, Nick sees Catherine snorting cocaine with Roxy at a club. They return to Catherine's place and Roxy observes Nick and Catherine having rough sex, with Catherine tying Nick to the bed. This mirrors the way Boz was tied up by the mystery blonde. Jealous of Nick, Roxy tries to run him over with Catherine's car but dies when the vehicle crashes. Catherine is saddened by Roxy's death and confesses to Nick about a college encounter with a girl that ended badly as the girl became obsessed with her. Nick identifies that girl as Beth; Beth claims that it was Catherine who was obsessed. Nick discovers that a college professor of Catherine and Beth's was killed with an ice pick in an unsolved homicide that inspired one of Catherine's early novels. Nick discovers the final pages of Catherine's book, where the fictional detective finds his partner's body in an elevator. Catherine breaks off their affair, leaving Nick upset and suspicious. He meets his partner, Gus Moran, who has arranged to meet Catherine's college roommate to learn about Catherine and Beth. Gus is stabbed to death with an ice pick in the elevator and Nick finds Gus' body in a fashion similar to the description in the book. Beth arrives unexpectedly and claims that she received a message to meet Gus. Nick suspects Beth of killing Gus and shoots her when he believes she's reaching for a gun. However, Beth was only fiddling with her keychain. Evidence implicates Beth in the murders of Boz, Nilsen, Moran, and her own husband. The investigators also find photos and newspaper clippings of Catherine that imply an obsession with her. Nick is left confused and dejected. Catherine meets him at his apartment and explains her reluctance to commit to him due to her loved ones dying. However, they have sex and discuss their future. As they do, an ice pick is seen under the bed, implying that Catherine was the killer all along. The screenplay, which was written in the 1980s, sparked a bidding war until it was finally purchased by Carolco Pictures for US$3million. Eszterhas, who had previously been the creative force behind several blockbuster films such as Flashdance (1983) and Jagged Edge (1985), managed to complete the script in just 13 days. However, Verhoeven had suggested changes to the script that Eszterhas strongly disagreed with, including a lesbian sex scene that Eszterhas deemed ""exploitative"". With Verhoeven unwilling to budge, Eszterhas and producer Irwin Winkler left the production. Gary Goldman was subsequently brought on board to rewrite the script four times at Verhoeven's suggestion. However, by the fourth draft, Verhoeven himself acknowledged that his proposals were ""undramatic"" and ""really stupid"". By the fifth and final draft, the script had returned to Eszterhas' original vision, with only minor tweaks to visuals and dialogue. As a result, Joe Eszterhas received sole writing credit for the film. In preparation for the car chase scene, Douglas drove up the steps on Kearny Street in San Francisco for four nights by himself. The home of Stone's character, prominently featured in the film, is said to be in Stinson Beach, California, just north of San Francisco. In reality, the scenes were shot at a mansion near Carmel-by-the-Sea, about 120 miles (190km) south of San Francisco. The property had been previously owned by the late adventurer Steve Fossett and his wife until her death in 2017. In 2018, the residence was purchased by software engineer Gary Vickers, who combined it into an estate with four adjoining cottages he also owned; he put the entire property on sale the following year for $52.4 million. By 2022, the asking price had been lowered to $29.6 million. Mel Gibson, Kevin Costner, and Richard Gere were considered for the role of Nick Curran, which eventually went to Michael Douglas. Douglas was cast in the project early on. He recommended Kim Basinger for the role of Catherine Tramell, but she declined. He also suggested Julia Roberts, Greta Scacchi, and Meg Ryan, but they all turned down the role. Debra Winger, Michelle Pfeiffer, Geena Davis, Kathleen Turner, Kelly Lynch, Ellen Barkin, and Mariel Hemingway all turned down the role as well when offered by Verhoeven and producers. Verhoeven considered Demi Moore, but ultimately chose Sharon Stone, with whom he had previously worked on Total Recall. Verhoeven had been particularly struck by the way she quickly transitioned from evil to love in a couple of seconds before her character's death in that film. Michael Douglas was upset that the relatively unknown Stone was cast in the role, determined to have another A-list actress star in the movie with him. Worried about taking the risk on his own, he said, ""I need someone to share the risks of this movie.  I don't want to be up there all by myself. There's going to be a lot of shit flying around."" Stone was paid $500,000 for her role, while Douglas received $14 million. The musical score for Basic Instinct was composed by Jerry Goldsmith and earned him nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. Goldsmith described the process as challenging, stating, ""Basic Instinct was probably the most difficult  I've ever done. It's a very convoluted story with very unorthodox characters. It's a murder mystery, but it isn't really a murder mystery. The director, Paul Verhoeven, had a very clear idea of how the woman should be, and I had a hard time getting it. Because of Paul pushing me, I think it's one of the best scores I've ever written. It was a true collaboration."" In terms of featured music, commercially released tracks played a minor role in the film. The club scene prominently features ""Blue"" by Chicago house music performer LaTour and ""Rave the Rhythm"" by the group Channel X, as well as ""Movin' on Up"" by Jeff Barry and Ja'Net DuBois. Chris Rea's ""Looking for the Summer"" is heard during a scene between Douglas and his partner at Mac's Diner. The film's official soundtrack was released on March 17, 1992. In 2004, Prometheus Records issued an expanded version of Goldsmith's score, which included previously omitted sections and alternative compositions for certain elements. The film opened in North American theatres in March 1992, and after being entered into the 1992 Cannes Film Festival continued on to a worldwide release. Basic Instinct is rated R for ""strong violence and sensuality, and for drug use and language"". Initially, the film was given an NC-17 rating by the MPAA for ""graphic depictions of extremely explicit violence, sexual content and strong language"". However, under pressure from TriStar and Carolco, Verhoeven cut 35 to 40 seconds from the film to achieve an R rating. Verhoeven described the changes in a March 1992 article in The New York Times: Actually, I didn't have to cut many things, but I replaced things from different angles, made it a little more elliptical, a bit less direct. The European theatrical release did not require these cuts. The uncut version was later released in the USA on home video. Following its theatrical version, an unrated version of the film was released on video in 1992, running at 129 minutes. In 1997, a DVD release containing only the R-rated version was issued, followed by a ""collector's edition"" DVD release in 2001. This edition contained the uncut version of the film along with a commentary by Camille Paglia and a small ice pick (which was actually a pen), the villain's weapon of choice. This version, which runs 127 minutes, was subsequently re-released twice in 2003 and 2006, respectively. In March 2006, the unrated version, also known as the ""director's cut"", was re-released on DVD and labeled as the ""ultimate edition"". The film was released on Blu-ray in 2007 with the ""director's cut"" label. The theatrical release of the film was cut by 35 to 40 seconds to avoid an NC-17 rating, with some violence and sexually explicit content removed. The missing or censored material, later released on video and DVD as the director's cut, included: In 2021, StudioCanal released a restored 4K Ultra HD 'collector's edition' of the film on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download in the UK (June 14), Australia (July 7), and New Zealand (July 14). The restoration was supervised by the director and completed in 2019–2020, using the original 35MM negative. Additionally, a new documentary titled ""Basic Instinct, Sex, Death & Stone"" was added as a special feature. Basic Instinct opened in theaters in the United States and Canada on March 20, 1992, and became one of the highest-grossing films of that year. It debuted at number one at the US box office, grossing $15million in its opening weekend. After briefly dropping down the charts, it returned to number one in its fifth week, where it remained for four weeks. In total, the film grossed $117.7 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally, it grossed $352,927,224, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film released in 1992 worldwide. In Italy, it had a record opening of $5.44million and remained number one for four weeks, ultimately grossing $20million and becoming the highest-grossing film for the year. It was the highest-grossing film in Spain of all time, with a gross of $21.6million, and in the United Kingdom, it was number one for three weeks and the highest-grossing film for the year with a gross of £15.5 million. It was also number one for the year in France ($27 million), Germany (4.5 million admissions), South Africa ($3 million), Iceland, and Ireland. In Australia, it was number one for three weeks and the second-highest-grossing film for the year, grossing A$13.1 million. Basic Instinct's critical reaction was mixed. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 57% based on 74 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2010 and the consensus that ""Unevenly echoing the work of Alfred Hitchcock, Basic Instinct contains a star-making performance from Sharon Stone, but is ultimately undone by its problematic, overly lurid plot."" On Metacritic the film holds a score of 43 based on 28 critics, indicating ""mixed or average"" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale. Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised the film, saying ""Basic Instinct transfers Mr. Verhoeven's flair for action-oriented material to the realm of Hitchcockian intrigue, and the results are viscerally effective even when they don't make sense."" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also praised the film, saying it was a guilty pleasure film; he also expressed admiration for Verhoeven's direction, saying his ""cinematic wet dream delivers the goods, especially when Sharon Stone struts on with enough come-on carnality to singe the screen,"" and praised Stone's performance: ""Stone, a former model, is a knockout; she even got a rise out of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Verhoeven's Total Recall. But being the bright spot in too many dull movies (He Said, She Said; Irreconcilable Differences) stalled her career. Though Basic Instinct establishes Stone as a bombshell for the Nineties, it also shows she can nail a laugh or shade an emotion with equal aplomb."" Australian critic Shannon J. Harvey of the Sunday Times called it one of the ""1990s finest productions, doing more for female empowerment than any feminist rally. Stone—in her star-making performance—is as hot and sexy as she is ice-pick cold."" The film had many detractors. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded it two out of four stars, saying the film was well crafted but died down in the last half-hour: ""The film is like a crossword puzzle. It keeps your interest until you solve it. Then it's just a worthless scrap with the spaces filled in."" Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune also gave a negative review, calling it psychologically empty: ""Verhoeven does not explore the dark side, but merely exploits it, and that makes all the difference in the world."" The film generated controversy upon its release due to its explicit sexuality, violence against women, and its negative depiction of both a bisexual woman and homosexual relationships. In recent years, controversy over the film has become regenerated over Verhoeven's direction and the treatment of Stone and other women working on the film. After the script was made available to gay rights activist groups in early 1991, concerns arose as to the film's depiction of homosexual relationships, and the portrayal of a bisexual woman as a murderous psychopath. Activists claimed that the film followed a pattern of negative depictions and stereotypes of homosexuals in film. While Eszterhas was open to addressing these concerns, Verhoeven, Douglas, and producer Alan Marshall rejected the changes, claiming that they ""undermined"" Eszterhas' script and ""lessen the integrity of the picture."" Upon resuming filming in San Francisco in late April 1991, gay and lesbian rights activists and demonstrators attended, and the San Francisco Police Department's riot police were present at every location to manage the crowds. Protesters outside the filming locations held signs that said ""Honk if you love the 49ers"" and ""Honk if you love men."" On April 29, Marshall ordered a citizen's arrest and personally identified each protester he wanted arrested. However, this did not result in any action by the local police department. Members of the lesbian and bisexual activist group LABIA protested against the film on its opening night. Others also picketed theatres to dissuade people from attending screenings, carrying signs saying ""Kiss My Ice Pick"", ""Hollywood Promotes Anti-Gay Violence"" and ""Catherine Did It!""""Save Your Money—The Bisexual Did It"". Verhoeven himself defended the groups' right to protest, but criticized the disruptions they caused, saying ""Fascism is not in raising your voice; the fascism is in not accepting the no."" Film critic Roger Ebert mentioned the controversy in his review, saying ""As for the allegedly offensive homosexual characters: The movie's protesters might take note of the fact that this film's heterosexuals, starting with Douglas, are equally offensive. Still, there is a point to be made about Hollywood's unremitting insistence on typecasting homosexuals—particularly lesbians—as twisted and evil."" Camille Paglia denounced gay activist and feminist protests against Basic Instinct, and called Sharon Stone's performance ""one of the great performances by a woman in screen history"", praising her character as ""a great vamp figure, like Mona Lisa herself, like a pagan goddess."" Women's rights groups also protested the film over its negative depiction of women and a brutal rape scene, with a branch of The National Organization for Women calling the film ""the most blatantly misogynistic film in recent memory."" Its Los Angeles branch president at the time claimed the movie sent a message ""that women like violence, women like to be used, women like to be raped."" The film was also criticized for glamorizing cigarette smoking. Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas was later diagnosed with throat cancer and publicly apologized for glamorizing smoking in his films. Since the release of the film, Stone has alleged multiple times that a scene in which her vulva was exposed as she crossed her legs was filmed without her knowledge. Stone later said she was told that her lack of underwear would only be alluded to and not shown. She had been wearing white underwear until Verhoeven said they reflected light on the camera lens and asked her to remove them, assuring her that only a shadow would be visible. Stone stated that it was not until she saw the film in a screening room with a test audience that she became aware of the visible nudity, leading her to slap Verhoeven in the face and leave the screening. In her 2021 memoir, Stone alleged once again that she was misled by Verhoeven with regard to the circumstance of the filming of the scene, even though she ultimately did not seek an injunction against it. Verhoeven responded that it was ""impossible"" and ""she knew exactly what we were doing."" However, despite having a ""radically different"" memory about the particular scene, he praised Stone's performance and said they are on good terms. However, in her 1998 Inside the Actors Studio interview, Stone said that while she was initially angry, she realized the director's decision was the right one, saying ""And I thought about it for a few days and I knew in my heart, he was right. I hated that it existed, I hated it more than he stole it from me instead of allowing me to choose. But he was right."" Jeanne Tripplehorn has also said that the notorious scene in which her character and Douglas' had brutal, bruising sex was somewhat ""lighter"" when described to her by Verhoeven before shooting. During the trial of the murder of Jun Lin, the prosecution stated that Luka Magnotta was inspired by the film and Stone's character, Catherine Tramell. AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains",Normal

"Imagination inflation is a type of memory distortion that occurs when imagining an event that never happened increases confidence in the memory of the event. Several factors have been demonstrated to increase the imagination inflation effect. Imagining a false event increases familiarity, which may cause people to mistake this as evidence that they have experienced the event. Imagination inflation could also be the result of source confusion or source monitoring errors. When imagining a false event, people generate information about the event that is often stored in their memory. Later, they might remember the content of the memory but not its source and mistakenly attribute the recalled information to a real experience. This effect is relevant to the study of memory and cognition, particularly false memory. Imagination inflation often occurs during attempts to retrieve repressed memories (i.e. via recovered memory therapy) and may lead to the development of false or distorted memories. In criminal justice, imagination inflation is tied to false confessions because police interrogation practices involving suspects to imagine committing or planning the crime in question. In 1996, Elizabeth Loftus, Maryanne Garry, Charles Manning, and Steven Sherman, conducted the original imagination inflation study. The study examined the effect of imagining a childhood event on childhood memories. It was the first study to examine the effects of imagining false events on memory in the absence of other factors present in previous studies, such as social pressure. In the study, the act of imagining unexperienced childhood events, such as being rescued by a lifeguard or breaking a window with one's hand, increased confidence that the events had occurred. After people imagined events with low initial confidence ratings (i.e. ones which they originally said they had not experienced) they became more confident that the events took place compared with unimagined ones. Due to the unreliability of memory, it is not possible to be certain whether or not someone has had a given experience based solely self-reports. This leaves open the possibility that imagination does not actually have any effect on beliefs about false past events, but instead helps people retrieve actual memories of true experiences. In 1998, Lyn Goff and Henry Roediger used a different method to study imagination inflation effect for events that could be confirmed. It also looked at the effect of imagination on recognition reports rather than confidence ratings. Participants performed certain actions (such as breaking a toothpick) but not others, then imagined doing other actions in the overall set, and finally were given a list of old actions encountered in the first two parts of the study and brand new actions. Participants were more likely to mistakenly say that they had performed imagined actions compared to unimagined actions. Later studies have used similar methods with a pre-test rating of a series of events, an intervening cognitive task using the events, and a post-test confidence rating. These have shown that a similar imagination inflation effect occurs when instead of imagining, people simply explain how events could have happened or paraphrase them. These findings suggest that vivid imagining is not always necessary for ""imagination inflation"" to occur; explanation or paraphrasing may function to make the false event seem more fluent and thus more familiar without producing a detailed image of it. Other research has investigated what types of events can show an imagination inflation effect, often using a method similar to Goff and Roediger's, in which participants perform some actions but not others, then imagine some of them, and later mistakenly believe they have performed imagined actions but not control unimagined ones. One comparison found a similar imagination inflation effect for actions identical to those in Goff and Roediger's study (i.e. ""break the toothpick"") and altered, bizarre versions of such actions (i.e. ""kiss the magnifying glass""). Another found an effect when people imagined a highly unusual action such as kissing a vending machine or lying on a couch and talking to Sigmund Freud. Some people have developed false beliefs of having performed bizarre actions or experienced more ordinary events even after imagining somebody else, rather than themselves, performing them. The cause of the imagination inflation effect is debated. There is evidence that source-monitoring framework, the familiarity misattribution theory, and the effects of sensory elaboration contribute to the formation of false memories through imagination inflation. It has been theorized that these effects, and other unknown effects, all contribute to the imagination inflation effect. The source-monitoring framework, developed by Thomas et al., states that memories are not specified as real or imagined. Thus, under this framework, after imaging an event, it is difficult to distinguish whether the memory is real or not. Under the familiarity misattribution theory, the imagination inflation effect is likely to occur because imagining an event increases familiarity with that event. This familiarity is then misattributed and interpreted as evidence that the event actually occurred. Thomas et al. argue that perceptual components of imagining events confuse actual lived memories because of elaboration. When participants included sensory details while recalling imagined events, participants were more likely to falsely remember the imagined events. Participants were thought to confuse imagined events with actual events because of the specific and elaborate nature of their imagination. The results of the study argue that elaboration (in the form of vivid sensory details) leads to increased formation of false memories. Imagination inflation has implications for the criminal justice system, in particular interrogation and interviewing procedures. Interrogators who ask suspects to repeatedly imagine committing a crime risk making their suspects more confident that they are the perpetrators, ultimately producing false confessions from innocent suspects. In one case in the United States in the 1990s, after an intense police interrogation, a man who initially denied accusations of raping his daughters admitted to crimes that were even denied by his accusers, including abusing his children and leading a satanic cult which sacrificed babies. The psychologist Richard Ofshe argued that the confessions were false memories created by repeated suggestion. In another interrogation technique, interrogators ask suspects to explain how a crime might have been committed or how they themselves could have done it. This practice has been suggested as another cause of self-generated false confessions because it forces an innocent suspect to create a believable narrative of their own guilt. This is supported by research in which people explained how a false childhood event could have occurred, and, after, became more confident that it had really happened. A 2001 critique argued that the original findings of the 1996 imagination inflation study did not in fact reflect changed beliefs about the past via imagination, but were instead a product of regression to the mean. That is, events with confidence ratings at the extreme (low or high) ends of the scale at the first time of measurement happened to have such scores due only to observational error, so they became more moderate at post-test. The authors of the 1996 paper disagreed with this interpretation, pointing out several issues that they found in Pezdek's reasoning. In particular, they agreed that regression to the mean was present in their own data and contributed to the overall changes in confidence at the second test. But this could not explain the finding that imagining events that were low in confidence led to a greater increase in ratings than for unimagined low-confidence events, as regression to the mean should affect all events equally.",Normal

"Muriel A. Howard (b. 19471948) (formerly Muriel A. Moore) is the former president of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU) in Washington, D.C., and served as the seventh president of Buffalo State College at the State University of New York (SUNY) system from 1996 to 2009. Prior to her presidency at Buffalo State College, she was the vice president for public services and urban affairs at the SUNY educational institution, the University at Buffalo, where she worked for 23 years. Howard was educated at public universities in New York State, as well as at Harvard University, where she graduated from the University's Institute of Management. Howard has been a leader and member of many corporate boards of directors; and councils and committees in higher education and city government. Further, she has been the recipient of many awards and honors throughout her career. Howard was born in Wilson, North Carolina, but lived some of her later childhood years and youth in Queens, New York. She moved to Buffalo, New York when she became a student at the University at Buffalo. She received her Bachelor of Arts in sociology from Richmond College, City University of New York; and her master's of education and doctorate in educational organization, administration, and policy from the University at Buffalo, She also graduated from Harvard University's Institute of Management. Howard has received six honorary degrees, including, in part: Howard's professional and scholarly interests include the support of education; educational leadership; and the representation of women and minorities in both the academy and public service. Howard held the highest post at the University prior to becoming President of Buffalo State College. She was a member of UB President Bill Greiner's administrative team. Upon being named to her position as vice president for Public Service and Urban Affairs at UB, Howard had much to share regarding her vision for UB. In a December 2, 1992 Buffalo News article by Henry L. Davis, Howard is quoted, stating about UB upon her new appointment: As the leader of Buffalo State College, Howard headed a campus of more than 11,000 students; approximately 1,700 faculty and staff; and a financial operation of more than $214million. She is also the first woman to have led the college. Former New York State Assembly Member Sam Hoyt graduated from the College and the college was in his district; he shared his perspective about Howard's appointment. Of Howard's appointment to the Buffalo State College presidency, Hoyt said of her in the December 12, 1995 city edition of The Buffalo News: Howard (then-Moore) began her leadership at the college as Interim President. Prior to coming to the college, Howard had little experience in interacting with faculty, however her organizational skills and ability to resolve conflicts were praised. Additionally, she was praised as a ""tough administrator"" who ""knows the system"" by former Buffalo Common Council President George K. Arthur; and it was said that she had the respect of students. The college had a reputation as a ""tough place to manage,"" and was expected to have difficulty in attracting qualified candidates to the position of the presidency. Quoted in an April 24, 1996 article by Karen Brady in The Buffalo News, Howard stated about the College: In her Inaugural Address, Howard focused on the diversity of the college as a strength. In 1996, Howard is quoted in a November 2, 1996 edition of the Afro-American Red Star, a requite from her Inaugural Address, stating: Within one month of assuming her leadership position at the college, Howard shared three short-term goals for strengthening it in an address to faculty. Those three goals included ""increasing recruitment and retention of students; developing strategies to address the 1996-97 budget;  dealing with the 'institutional climate' that has emerged."" On the 125th anniversary of the college in 1996, Howard oversaw many events that celebrated the quasquicentennial event. On that day, there were proclamations issued by Buffalo Mayor Anthony Masiello as well as Erie County Executive Dennis Gorski. Celebrations included a cake in the shape of Rockwell Hall, a champagne toast, a big band, a chorale ensemble and additional wind ensembles, fireworks, tours of campus arts centers, exhibits, and a play area for kids. During her tenure as interim president, Howard's main goal is ""dealing directly with allegations of racial and sexual discrimination"" at the college. Howard stated in February 1996 that the college had held 60 programs on racial and cultural diversity, and gender during the previous fall. The Institute for the Healing of Racism began a two-month forum in the Spring 1996 semester at the college; and closed hearings on sexual harassment and gender bias were being held within the College Senate's Committee on the Status of Women. Howard stated her belief of the College being ""a real role model for the community."" In the period from 1996 to 1998, there were a number of deans and administrators who had been on leave through an arrangement with the previous college president, F.C. Richardson, and SUNY, andor who had resigned to take other posts or due to retirement. In 1996, as a result of those on leave or because of resignations, there was only one permanent academic post that had remained filled at the college. At that time, there were five top leaders at the College who were either on leave or who had resigned to take other posts. Howard was in the process of considering applicants in order to fill open andor interim positions during that time. One dean who left to take another position stated that it was a time in the college's history in which important leadership choices were to be made that would take the institution into the next century. In 1997, through Buffalo Mayor Anthony Masiello's office and under the direction of Buffalo State College's Center for Applied Research in Interactive Technologies, CityNet, an advanced telecommunications network that links 14 educational and community sites in Buffalo was launched. For more than two years, Masiello and his team worked with NYNEX and Bell Atlantic to lay the foundation for the network, which is funded by Bell Atlantic for $1.9million. Of the launching of the telecommunications network, Howard stated in a November 25, 1997 Buffalo News article by Karen Brady: In 1998, Howard made a personal effort to expand the Nurturing Initiative and Achievements (NIA) in Students Mentor Program at the college by offering a distance learning program at San José, Costa Rica. Howard went to Costa Rica in order to inaugurate a network that connects San Jose's Lincoln School with the college, as well as Clarence Central, Grover Cleveland, and City Honors high schools. Reported in a 1998 Buffalo News article was that Howard envisioned in 1995 that the Carriage House on the property of the President's Residence could be transformed into a guest house. The House had been used as servant's quarters after it was first built. The Junior League of Buffalo and Chase Pitkin contributed to the remodeling of the Carriage House, with the Junior League identifying it as its 1997 Decorator Show House. The Carriage House was built in 1912; and now serves as a guest house for visitors of the college, providing much lower rates for accommodation than hotels at which visitors would otherwise stay. Howard participated in talks with the Buffalo Psychiatric Center, the Buffalo Mayor's Office, and others regarding usage expansion for the psychiatric center. Buffalo State College has occupied Buffalo Psychiatric Center lands since the 1960s; and phases of expansion have occurred in recent years that have revitalized and refurbished parts of the facility, including the Richardson Olmsted Complex, for different uses. One of the interests of the college was to use lands for expansion, and to build a new Burchfield Penney Art Center, a desire that was eventually achieved. Regarding the College's interests for joint use of the psychiatric center land, Howard stated in a June 10, 1999 article by Kevin Collison in The Buffalo News: I think the answer to the property is to bring together the public needs of education and also have space for clean private enterprise to bring dollars into the community. During the Fall semester of 1998, controversy surrounding the campus bookstore contract was made public. Traditionally, Follett College Stores - the largest college bookstore company in the country - held the bookstore contract at the college. Concern by college administration that many college textbooks were being sold beyond the list price prompted the submission of a new bookstore contract with Barnes & Noble by Howard to the state comptroller, Carl McCall. Barnes & Noble is the largest book retailer in the United States. As a result, - and due to the college already maintaining a contract with Follett - the executive board of the college's Faculty Student Association (FSA) voted to withhold $25,000 in discretionary funds during that semester, funds that are traditionally issued to the college president for discretionary purposes. This move by the FSA was unprecedented; however the aim of involvement by FSA was to obtain a judicious decision about the matter from the state comptroller. The bookstore contract for 1998 also included that a new building to house it would be constructed. Howard ended up contracting with Barnes & Noble amid appeals to the state comptroller by two of three bidders for the bookstore contract. In a 1998 article by FSA President Michael Paluch that appeared in The Buffalo News, Paluch stated that, as a result of the change, ""Textbook prices will be higher, student wages will be lower, and the college will get substantially less construction dollars for a new store from Barnes & Noble than from the Faculty-Student Association."" In 1996, Howard spoke at a businesswomen's networking luncheon reception at the College that celebrated Women's History Month, and more specifically, Women's History Week. In 1998, Howard attended the second conference of African-American college presidents, held in Washington, DC. The Washington Post article of June 14, 1998 by Peter S. Goodman stated that only 26 college presidents in the United States at the time were African-American, this number being reflective of the more than 1,800 colleges in America that are majority-white. The main purpose of the conference was to create dialogue about race in higher education and to increase the numbers of African-Americans holding top leadership posts in American academia. When Howard announced that she was leaving the college to take on the national role of leading the AASCU, an organization that advocates for and promotes the interests of 430 public colleges and universities, Hoyt stated that her crowning achievement at the college was likely the Burchfield Penney Arts Center. Former New York State Assembly Member Sam Hoyt stated that Howard raised the college's stature both in the state and the nation. He additionally stated that she would be difficult to replace, and that she would be sorely missed. Her leadership of the College provided increased stability for it, as well as increased student enrollment during her 13 years there. During her last year as president of the college, Howard's salary was reported to be $220,000. In 2009, it was announced that Howard would be leaving Buffalo State College to become the president of the AASCU in Washington, DC. From August 2009 to January 2018, she served in that capacity. She is the first African-American and first woman to be president of the organization. In 2009, Howard was interviewed for an article that appeared in The Chronicle of Higher Education with regards to her appointment as president of the AASCU. In her interview by Sara Hebel in 2009 that was published in The Chronicle of Higher Education, Howard stated regarding her leadership style: As AASCU president, Howard has shown support for comprehensive immigration reform. She has stated support for the Pass the Dream Act, for enhancing H1-B Visas, and for streamlining green cards. She states that all of these actions will support students in America who are undocumented, and will help maintain American competitiveness, as well as keeping ""talent...at home."" In 2013, Howard gave the keynote address at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Brockport's Annual Diversity Conference. The theme of the 2013 Conference was ""Building Community through Diversity: Championing Access and Equity;"" and Howard's speech was titled, ""Community and the 21st Century Student."" The focus of Howard's speech was on how public colleges and universities can achieve that objective. In her 2013 keynote speech given at SUNY Brockport, Howard is quoted, stating about students, schools, and diversity: Howard retired as president of AASCU in January 2018, and Dr. Mildred García was appointed president of AASCU. Howard's community involvement included membership on the executive committee for the Buffalo Niagara Partnership, Niagara University Board of Directors, Buffalo Public Schools Foundation Board of Directors, and the King Urban Life Center Board of Directors. She also served on the corporate board of directors for the Farm Credit of Western New York, and the Fleet Bank Community Advisory Board.

"The women's artistic team all-around competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics was held at Earls Court Exhibition Centre on 13 and 14 August. It was the third appearance of the event. The gymnastics format continued to use the aggregation format used in 1928 and 1936, the previous appearances of the event. The parallel bars, however, were replaced by the flying rings (the only time women competed using the flying rings in the Olympics). Each nation entered a team of eight gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise on the vault and beam, and a compulsory exercise on the flying rings, with the scores summed to give a final total. Each team also performed two group exercises. The top six individual scores on each team and the two group exercises were summed to give a team all-around score. No individual medals (for either all-around or apparatus) were awarded for women.",Normal
"Jarren William Duran (born September 5, 1996) is an American professional baseball outfielder for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). Listed at 6feet 2inches (1.88m) and 200 pounds (91kg), he bats left-handed and throws right-handed. He has played for the Mexico national baseball team. Duran attended Cypress High School in Cypress, California, then played three seasons of college baseball at California State University, Long Beach, where he was primarily a second baseman. In 2017, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the seventh round of the 2018 Major League Baseball draft. Duran spent his first professional season with the Lowell Spinners and Greenville Drive, batting a combined .357 during 2018. He started the 2019 season with the High-A Salem Red Sox, and was promoted to the Double-A Portland Sea Dogs on June 3. In mid-June, Duran was added to the top 100 prospects list of Baseball America, at number 99. Duran was named to the 2019 All-Star Futures Game, going 1-for-2 after entering the game in the sixth inning. In mid-September, Duran was named the High-A (Class A-Advanced) player of the year by Baseball America, and was named the Red Sox' minor league baserunner of the year. Overall during 2019 with both Salem and Portland, Duran batted .303 with five home runs and 38 RBIs in 132 games. Duran was invited to spring training by the Red Sox in 2020. He did not play that season, due to cancellation of the minor league season. In November 2020, Duran was ranked by Baseball America as the Red Sox' number five prospect. During the 2020–21 Puerto Rican Winter League season, he was named MVP of the final series, helping Criollos de Caguas to the championship. The Red Sox invited Duran to their spring training for the second consecutive season in 2021; he subsequently started the season with the Triple-A Worcester Red Sox. On July 16, he was selected to Boston's 40-man roster. He made his MLB debut the following day, starting in center field against the New York Yankees. In his first at-bat, he collected a hit off of Gerrit Cole and came around to score two batters later. He hit his first major-league home run on July 19 against Ross Stripling of the Toronto Blue Jays. Duran was placed on the COVID-19 related injured list on August 6, and returned to the lineup two days later. On August 24, Duran was optioned back to Triple-A, having batted .221 with 33 strikeouts in 89 plate appearances with Boston. He was recalled to Boston two days later, when Hunter Renfroe was placed on the bereavement list. On September 3, Duran was placed on the COVID-related list. He was activated on September 23 and optioned to Worcester. Overall with Boston during the regular season, Duran appeared in 33 games, batting .215 with two home runs and 10 RBIs. He also made 60 appearances for Worcester, batting .258 with 16 home runs and 36 RBIs. Duran started the 2022 season in Triple-A with Worcester. He was ranked 84th in the list of baseball's top 100 prospects by Baseball America. Duran was with Boston for the game of May 6, while Kiké Hernández was on the COVID-related injured list. He was also briefly with Boston in early June, while Jackie Bradley Jr. was on the paternity list. He was again recalled in mid-June when Christian Arroyo was placed on the COVID-related list. Duran remained with Boston until being placed on the restricted list in late June when the team traveled to Toronto, due to his vaccination status. On July 22, he once again fell victim to Toronto, this time in center field at Fenway Park where he lost track of a fly ball and apparently gave up on the play, resulting in Raimel Tapia of the Blue Jays scoring an inside-the-park grand slam; the Red Sox lost the game, 28–5, setting a Blue Jays record for the largest margin of victory. Duran was optioned back to Worcester on August 27, when Trevor Story was activated from the injured list. Duran was later recalled by the Red Sox for one game in Toronto, on September 30, having been vaccinated since the June series. Overall for the season, Duran played in 58 major-league games, batting .221 with 3 home runs and 17 RBIs, and 68 minor-league games, batting .283 with 10 home runs and 38 RBIs. Duran was optioned to Triple-A Worcester to begin the 2023 season. He was recalled to Boston on April 17, after an injury to Adam Duvall Over the next several months, Duran established himself as an effective hitter (ranked fourth in MLB for doubles) and base stealer (24-for-26) at the major-league level. He became a fixture in Boston's lineup, and established himself as an everyday player. On August 22, however, he was placed on the injured list due to a toe injury. On August 29, it was announced that Duran would undergo a season-ending surgery for turf toe. Duran batted .295 with 8 home runs and 40 RBIs through 102 games in 2023, adding 24 stolen bases. At the time of his injury, his 34 doubles were seventh in MLB and fourth in the American League. On September 4, the team transferred him to the 60-day injured list. Duran is of Mexican descent through his father. He played in the 2021 Caribbean Series for the Criollos de Caguas, where he helped lead the team to the championship game and was selected to the All-Tournament Team. In May 2021, Duran was named to the roster of the United States national baseball team for the Americas Qualifying Event. While the team qualified for the 2020 Summer Olympics, held in Tokyo in 2021, Duran was not included on the Olympic roster, due to the possibility of being called up by the Red Sox.",Normal

"The North Western Expressway and the Lane Cove Valley Expressway was a planned but later cancelled freeway route in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, intended to link the Sydney central business district to its north-western suburbs, and ultimately the Sydney–Newcastle Freeway to Newcastle. The entirety of the Sydney to Newcastle route was to be known as the F3 Freeway, a name that remains as a common name of the Sydney–Newcastle Freeway. The North Western Expressway refers to the section between the Western Distributor and Victoria Road at Huntleys Point, while the Lane Cove Valley Expressway refers to the section between Huntleys Point and Wahroonga, passing through Lane Cove Valley. The route was planned as early as 1962 (even providing a proposed freeway ""dotted line"" in the UBD street directories of the 1970s). The original route was to start at the Western Distributor, connecting to Gladesville Bridge via a new elevated freeway. The route would continue approximately to the intersection of Delhi Road and Epping Road. The section from Fig Tree Bridge at Hunters Hill to Gladesville Bridge and the Western Distributor were the only completed sections, with the former section completed in 1965 with the opening of Tarban Creek Bridge. Work on stage one, from Ultimo to Pyrmont Bridge Road, began in 1974. Twelve people were arrested during protests in Ultimo against the expressway, a green ban was imposed by the Builders Labourers Federation, and the Whitlam government threatened to cut off $42 billion in road funding if the NSW government continued with construction. As a result, construction was suspended. The Wran government cancelled the project in 1977, as a part of a change in government policy regarding freeways. After cancellation, the section between Fig Tree Bridge and Lane Cove Road became part of the proposed Castlereagh Freeway. The section between Delhi Road and Epping Road was shown on a 1984 Department of Main Roads map, but was removed by 1988 when that map was reprinted. The Castlereagh Freeway evolved to become the North West Transport Link, now the M2 Hills Motorway, which was completed in 1997 and follows the originally planned route from Epping Road to Seven Hills. The section between Fig Tree Bridge and Epping Road was abandoned. The corridor of land to link the F3 and the M2 via the Lane Cove Valley was reserved for road use since 1988. It was abandoned by the state government in 1996, but was retained as open space. An alternative F3 to M2 link has been built as the NorthConnex and opened in 2020, under a different alignment.",Normal

"SS Comet was a steamship that operated on the Great Lakes. Comet was built in 1857 as a wooden-hulled propeller-driven cargo vessel that was soon adapted to carry passengers. It suffered a series of maritime accidents prior to its final sinking in 1875 causing the loss of ten lives. It became known as the only treasure ship of Lake Superior because she carried 70 tons of Montana silver ore when it sank. The first attempts to salvage its cargo in 1876 and 1938 were unsuccessful. Comet was finally salvaged in the 1980s when the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society illegally removed artifacts from the wreck. The artifacts are now the property of the State of Michigan and are on display as a loan to the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. The fate of her silver ore cargo is unknown. Comet's wreck is now protected by the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve as part of an underwater museum. The 181-foot (55m), 744-ton wooden propeller ship Comet, along with her sister ship, the Rocket, was launched in 1857 by Peak and Masters of Cleveland, Ohio. Her direct-acting vertical engine was manufactured by Cuyahoga Steam Furnace of Cleveland. Comet was originally built as a pure workhorse. Upper deck cabins for passenger accommodations were not added until the winter layup of 1859–60. Comet went through a variety of owners. She was first owned by Dean Richmond (New York Central Railroad). Her last owners were W.M. Hanna and George W. Chapin of Cleveland. Comet was involved in a series of maritime accidents prior to her final sinking in 1875. In 1863, she sank another boat in a collision on Lake Erie. She was run aground on a reef off Port Washington, Wisconsin in Lake Michigan in 1865. In August 1869, she rammed and sank the sidewheeler Silver Spray. Comet sank for the first time in 1869 after a collision with Hunter below Detroit, Michigan. Both vessels sank, were raised, and returned to service. Comet cleared Duluth, Minnesota on 23 August 1875 bound for Buffalo, New York with intermediate stops on Lake Superior. After she had rounded Whitefish Point Light on a clear, starlit night about 8:05 PM of 26 August 1875 and was heading on the usual southeast course to Point Iroquois Light, her lookout spotted a white light in the dusk right on their course. Fifteen minutes later, after the lookout spotted a red light, Captain Dugat altered course a point to port, heading southeast half south. Just moments later the green lights of an approaching vessel appeared. When Captain Dugat realized he had swung across the bow of a steamer, he blew one blast on the whistle and ordered a hard turn, but it was too late. Shipwreck historian Janice Gerred reported that the ""Canadian steamer Manitoba struck the Comet stem on about 20 feet (6.1m), forward the stern on the port side right down to the water's edge."" The Toronto Globe reported an eye witness account that Comet's hull parted and sank almost immediately; the upper works crumbled and sank within one minute. Two men were crushed when the steamers collided. One man was hanging from a window sash on Manitoba, lost his grip, and was heard exclaiming, ""Oh Lord, I am gone"" as the suction of the wreck pulled him down. Ten men, including those below deck, did not survive. Six men jumped from the wreck to the decks of Manitoba whose boats picked up four more survivors. Captain Dugat, the master, two shipmates, two wheelsmen, one fireman, one lookout, and one porter survived. Manitoba made every effort to save everyone possible. She took the rescued to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, where they were given passage to Cleveland. The United States maritime investigation absolved Comet's Captain Dugat of any blame for the collision in 1876. The Canadians absolved Manitoba's Captain Symes of any blame. Comet was first dubbed a ""true treasure ship"" by shipwreck historian Frederick Stonehouse in 1973. When she sank, her vessel was valued at $45,000 and the cargo at $50,000. The Sault Evening News of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan announced in 1980 that Comet was the ""only known treasure ship on the bottom of the lake"" when interviewing Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society  spokesperson Tom Farnquist. Comet carried 500tons of pig iron, some copper ore, 54 sacks of wool, and 70tons of Montana silver ore picked up at Duluth and consigned to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Efforts to salvage Comet's cargo failed in 1876 and again in 1938 when the wreck could not be found. The GLSHS in the 1980s extensively filmed and salvaged the Comet wreck. Comet was first located in the 1970s by Great Lakes diver Kent Bellrichard of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Bob Nicholls and Tom Farnquist of the GLSHS again located Comet on 6 June 1980. In July 1980 Farnquist announced ""divers will attempt to salvage as much of the silver as well as other salvageable material or artifacts. All of the process will be filmed. Proceeds will be used by the Shipwreck Society for further exploration and for the Society's museum work."" Michigan's Antiquities Act of 1980 prohibited the removal of artifacts from shipwrecks on the Great Lakes bottomlands. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE) 1992 raid on the GLSHS offices and Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum included seizure of artifacts that GLSHS had illegally removed from Comet, but her cargo of Montana silver ore was not accounted for in the Affidavit of Search Warrant & Investigation Report. Artifacts from the Comet wreck are on display in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum as a loan from the State of Michigan by a 1993 settlement agreement with the GLSHS following the DNRE raid on the museum in 1992. Comet lies in 230 feet (70m) of water at 46°43.02′N 84°52.00′W﻿ ﻿46.71700°N 84.86667°W﻿ 46.71700; -84.86667 in Whitefish Bay of Lake Superior. Scuba diving to the wrecksite requires advanced technical diving skills. Great Lakes diver Steve Harrington reported that ""divers will find much of the hull intact with twin standing arches."" The wreck is protected for future generations by the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve as part of an underwater museum. Several other ships have borne the name ""Comet"" including the PS Comet (1814), and another that broke apart in 1812 after a few runs. Cave dive sites:",Normal
"The King of the Cats (or The King o' the Cats) is a folk tale from the British Isles. The earliest known example is found in Beware the Cat, written by William Baldwin in 1553, though it is related to the first-century story of ""The Death of Pan"". Other notable versions include one in a letter written by Thomas Lyttelton, 2nd Baron Lyttelton, first published in 1782, M. G. Lewis told the story to Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1816, and a version was adapted by Joseph Jacobs from several sources, including one collected by Charlotte S. Burne. Walter Scott reported that it was a well known nursery tale in the Scottish Highlands in the eighteenth century. It can be categorised as a ""death of an elf (or cat)"" tale: Aarne–Thompson–Uther type 113A, or Christiansen migratory legend type 6070B. A man travelling alone sees a cat (or hears a voice), who speaks to him, saying to tell someone (often an odd name, presumably unknown to the character) that someone else (normally a similarly odd name) has died, though other versions simply have the traveller see a group of cats holding a royal funeral. He reaches his destination and recounts what happened, when suddenly the housecat cries something like ""Then I am the king of the cats!"", rushes up the chimney or out of the door, and is never seen again. An early mention of TybertTibert (the king of cats) can be found in William Caxton's 1481 print of the fable This is the table of the historye of reynart the foxe. In William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, Tybalt is referred to by Mercutio as ""Prince of Cats"", and though this is more likely in reference to TibertTybalt the ""Prince of Cats"" in Reynard the Fox, it demonstrates the existence of the phrase from at least the 16th century in England. Beware the Cat, written in 1553 and first published in 1561, known as the first horror fiction text longer than a short story and possibly the first novel (or novella) ever published in English, contains two traditional tales about cats, which appear in similar forms both before and after its publication; of which ""The King of the Cats"" is a notable example. A king or lord of the cats appears in at least two early Irish tales. Most notably, some versions of the Imtheacht na Tromdhaimhe (The Proceedings of the Great Bardic Institution) include a dispute between Senchán Torpéist the bard and king Guaire Aidne mac Colmáin of Connacht, which led to the bard first cursing all mice, killing a dozen of them in shame, followed by the cats who should have kept the mice in check; in retaliation, the king of the cats, Irusan son of Arusan hunts Senchán down intending to kill him, but is in turn killed by St Kieran. This tale was reworked by Lady Jane Wilde as ""Seanchan the Bard and the King of the Cats"", published in her 1866 book Ancient Legends of Ireland, and included in W. B. Yeats' 1892 book Irish Fairy Tales. The second was retold as ""When the King of the Cats Came to King Connal's Dominion"" in Padraic Colum's 1916 book The King of Ireland's Son. Cats are connected in many folklore traditions with the supernatural and supernatural beings such as elves and fairies. John Dunlop wrote a poem version of the story, inspired by the version found in Lord Lyttelton's letters, which was included in Poems on Several Occasions from 1793 to 1816 (1836). The story was mentioned in Henrietta Christian Wright's 1895 book Children's Stories in American Literature. On the death of Algernon Charles Swinburne in 1909, W. B. Yeats (then 38 years of age) was reported to have declared to his sister ""I am king of the cats."" Polish-French modern artist Balthus inscribed his 1935 self-portrait ""A Portrait of H.M. The King of the Cats Painted by Himself."" Stephen Vincent Benét's 1929 short story ""The King of the Cats"" based around this folk story was selected by The Library of America for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American Fantastic Tales, edited by Peter Straub. Straub's 1980 novel Shadowland references this tale as a central theme. Frances Jenkins Olcott's 1942 anthology Good Stories For Great Holidays included a version of Charlotte S. Burne's ""The King of the Cats"" adapted by Ernest Rhys. Barbara Sleigh's 1954 children's book Carbonel: The King of the Cats is inspired in part by this tale, as are its two sequels, The Kingdom of Carbonel and Carbonel and Callidor, which make up the Carbonel series. Paul Galdone published a children's picture book in 1980 titled King of the Cats. In John Crowley's 1987 novel The Solitudes, ""The King of the Cats"" is explicitly related to ""the Death of Pan"" as recorded by Plutarch and interpreted by Augustine of Hippo as a shift in World Ages. China Miéville takes the idea of a king of the cats from this story and Robert Irwin's ""Father of Cats"" from The Arabian Nightmare for his 1998 novel King Rat. American author P. T. Cooper's 2012 middle-grade children's novel, The King of the Cats, starts off with a retelling of the original legend but then picks up where the legend left off. The novel tells of the death of Tom Tildrum and the crowning of his successor, Jack Tigerstripes, who is told by a feline oracle on his coronation day that he is destined to be captured by a human and to end his life in exile. The resulting 217-page adventure is reminiscent of a Disney-style talking-animal story such as The Lion King. The title track of American rock band Ted Leo and the Pharmacists' 2003 EP Tell Balgeary, Balgury Is Dead was inspired by a County Cork version of ""The King of the Cats"", with the title referring to the cats' names in the story, and mention in the song of the story's setting, the graveyard at Inchigeelagh. Kim Newman's novella Vampire Romance (2012) has a group of vampire elders gathering after the downfall of Count Dracula to decide which one of them will become the next ""King of the Cats""; the story explicitly refers to the Tom Tildrum folk tale. This legend is referenced in the mangaanime, The Ancient Magus' Bride (chapters 4–7episodes 4–5): A cat, named Molly, is the current King of the Cats, and the first King is called ""Tim"" Also in other mangaanime, Aria the Natural by Kozue Amano, Cait Sith was featured as one of the characters. He was depicted as anthropomorphic fat black cat and rules over the Cats' Kingdom in Neo-Venezia, often involved mainly in more supranatural arcs. The story is referenced in the videogame Ni No Kuni where the kingdom of Ding Dong Dell is ruled by an anthropomorphic cat named King Tom Tildrum XIV. His counterpart in the human world is a housecat named Timmy Toldrum.",Normal
"Minervino José Lopes Pietra (born 1 March 1954) is a Portuguese former footballer who played as a right-back. He appeared in 323 Primeira Liga games over the course of 16 seasons, with Belenenses and Benfica (28 goals scored). Subsequently, he became a manager, working mainly as an assistant and having spells with both clubs. Born in Lisbon, Pietra started his professional career with local C.F. Os Belenenses, making nearly 150 official appearances with the first team in his five-year Primeira Liga spell and scoring nine goals. In 1976 the 22-year-old signed for S.L. Benfica, where he would remain until his retirement. With Benfica, Pietra won, always as an important defensive unit, the league in 1977, 1981, 1983 and 1984, adding five Taça de Portugal trophies. In 11 seasons he appeared in 320 games in all competitions, netting on 25 occasions; he also helped the club to the 1982–83 UEFA Cup final, lost to Belgium's R.S.C. Anderlecht (1–0 abroad, 1–1 at home). In the mid-1990s, Pietra began working as a manager, successively with Boavista FC, Belenenses, Benfica, F.C. Alverca (under his former Benfica teammate António Veloso, his fullback counterpart), F.C. Barreirense and G.D. Estoril Praia, the latter two as head coach. After nearly one decade out of the game he returned to Benfica in 2007, acting as match scout for two years then joining Jorge Jesus' coaching staff two years later, remaining with the side for several seasons in the latter capacity. Pietra earned 28 caps for Portugal, his first game being on 14 November 1973 in a 1–1 draw against Northern Ireland for the 1974 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, at the age of only 19. He appeared regularly the following years, but did not attend any major international tournament. Pietra's last match was on 21 September 1983 in a 5–0 win over Finland for the UEFA Euro 1984 qualification stages. Portugal reached the finals in France, but he was overlooked for the squad that eventually finished third. Benfica",Normal
"Pelham Jones Merrill (December 1, 1907 – November 5, 1991) was a justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama from 1953 to 1976. Merrill was born in Heflin, Alabama, into a prominent Alabama family; his father, Walter B. Merrill, would also serve as a state court legislator and judge. Merrill graduated from the University of Alabama in 1926 and received an LL.B. from the University of Alabama School of Law in 1934, thereafter entering the practice of law in Heflin. He maintained an office there until he took his seat on the Alabama Supreme Court in 1953.

"The Sixth and Forest Historic District is located in Des Moines, Iowa, United States. It is a Victorian era suburban commercial district on the northeastern and northwestern corners of the junction of 6th and Forest Avenues, and originally contained six buildings. The buildings on the northeast corner have subsequently been torn down. The historic district has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1996. It is a part of the Towards a Greater Des Moines MPS. The commercial district at the intersection of Sixth and Forest Avenues is the largest suburban commercial node in the Des Moines area during the Victorian era. It was located in the largest of the city's late-19th- and early-20th-century suburbs, North Des Moines. Land use in the district is clearly defined in the area. All of the residential units are located on the second floor of the buildings with commercial stores on the first floor. There are no single-family houses in the district. Typical of Victorian districts is the presence of a lodge hall. An Odd Fellows hall was located at 1401 Sixth Avenue and is no longer in existence. The first floor of the building was rented out for commercial use while the second floor was used by the fraternal organization. Sixth Avenue was a major street car line in the city, and Forest Avenue was a major east-west route during the Victorian era. This contributed to the economic success of the area while it was being developed. Transportation corridors also encouraged higher population density. Multi-family dwellings were built along Forest Avenue and several churches were established in the area. North Park Congregational Church, which no longer exists, was on the southwest corner of Sixth and Forest Avenues. The Sixth and Forest Historic District contains both sophisticated and more modest expressions of Victorian commercial architecture in Des Moines. The quality of building materials in this district is generally superior to that of other suburban commercial nodes in the city from the same era. A couple of distinguishing features of the district is the use of polychrome brick and a variety of brick textures used in the construction of several of the buildings. The Orvis Block, which was an example of this, is no longer in existence. The Temple Block on the northwest corner of the intersection is a richly embellished two-story structure. It is composed of five commercial spaces on its first floor and stretches along a half-city block. The extended facade line of the building is unified by symmetrically placed bays, an undulating rhythm of its second floor belt course and a dentils along the cornice. The round arch above the entrance to the residential space in the Temple Block suggests the Romanesque Revival style. The Odd Fellows Hall, although a large two-story structure, was an example of a more modest use of architectural detailing. The small, single-story commercial building next door to it on Sixth Avenue was similar in its architectural details.",Normal

"Maxwell Scott Green (born December 15, 1984), better known as Max Green, is an American musician who is the former bassistbacking vocalist and one of the founders of the band Escape the Fate, the former rhythm guitarist and vocalist for the band The Natural Born Killers, and former bassistbacking vocalist for the band Falling in Reverse. He is currently the bassistbacking vocalist for his own band, Violent New Breed. Green was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and moved to Pahrump, Nevada, when he was in 4th grade. After living there for three years, he moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. Green has played guitar since his childhood and dreamed of becoming a professional musician. During his teenage years, Green began playing the bass guitar, inspired by the albums Progress, Resignation and ... And the Battle Begun by the band RX Bandits. He borrowed many ideas for his music from Spencer Chamberlain's (singer of Underoath) screamed vocal technique. As a teenager, Green participated in several bands as a bassist. After meeting fellow musician Ronnie Radke in high school, the two formed the band True Story, which later formed into the first-lineup Escape the Fate. Green is best known for his work in Escape the Fate. He left the band and joined Falling in Reverse which he also left only months after joining. He is now the founder of a band called Violent New Breed. Green formed Escape the Fate with Ronnie Radke and Monte Money in mid-2002. After joining the post-hardcore music scene in Las Vegas, the band managed to win a contest to open up for My Chemical Romance which led to the band signing with Epitaph Records and recorded their first album, Dying Is Your Latest Fashion, which was released in September 2006. Following the arrest of Ronnie Radke, the band replaced Radke with Craig Mabbitt from Blessthefall, and released their second album, This War Is Ours. After many international tours, the band had garnered popularity worldwide, and signed with major label Interscope Records. They made their major label debut with their third album, titled Escape the Fate, in November 2010. In November 2010, Green overdosed on heroin, and was removed from Escape the Fate. This resulted in the band being forced to cancel their tours in Europe with Bullet for My Valentine. Soon after the cancellation of these tours, it was widely rumored that Green had left the band. Green later returned to the band. On March 4, 2012, Max Green stated on his Twitter account that he was no longer playing in Escape the Fate due to personal and musical differences. Mabbitt hinted in an interview with Alternative Press that Green's departure was due to drugs. TJ Bell, former rhythm guitarist of Motionless in White, replaced Green in the position of bassist. After his departure from Escape the Fate, Green joined as rhythm guitarist and vocalist of the band The Natural Born Killers with Clayton Ryan as lead vocalist (formerly with A Smile From The Trenches), Brent Ashley as bassist (formerly with Wayne Static Current), Philip Kross as lead guitarist (formerly with Vampires Everywhere) and Farahn Gaiter as drummer (formerly with In The Name Of). The band played their first show on May 6, 2012, in Hollywood. On October 6, 2012. the band released their debut EP ""Oblivion"" and after Max Green left in late 2012, the band disbanded. On July 10, 2013, Green reunited with Escape the Fate for a one-off show playing This War Is Ours. In July of that year, Green announced during an interview to Alternative Press that he had been sober for 58 days and that the ""old Max is back"". It was announced on September 16, 2013, that Green would be returning to bass for Escape the Fate's tour with Five Finger Death Punch; Green was brought back when the band's guitarist, Monte Money, had refused to go on tour. On October 28, 2013, Craig Mabbitt announced in an interview with Ronnie Radke that Green was officially back in Escape the Fate, with Max joining as the bassistbacking vocalist, TJ Bell moving to rhythm guitarist, and Kevin Thrasher joining as the lead guitarist. On May 9, 2014, Green announced his second departure from the band, citing lack of fulfillment and passion as reasons. On May 12, 2014, it was announced that Green had joined Ronnie Radke's band, Falling in Reverse. Along with Green's arrival, Falling in Reverse bassist Ron Ficarro exited the band. “Ron was probably the best bass player I've ever played with,” says Ronnie Radke, “but at this moment in time I feel it is best to part ways with him. I respect him and wish nothing but the best for him. Max quitting Escape the Fate was like a godsend. It was a no brainer to have him join. I've known him half my life and this will be a great new chapter to start."" Green adds: “Reuniting with longtime friend Ronnie Radke in his band Falling in Reverse feels nothing but right at this time in my life. I look to forward to playing shows and creating memories together again with him and his amazing band of bros.” On June 11, 2014, the band covered the Green Day song, ""She's A Rebel"", for a Kerrang! tribute album. On October 6, 2014, a month before the Black Mass tour with Black Veil Brides started, it was announced that Green had left the band due to personal issues unrelated to the band. The departure was amicable. In 2013 before rejoining Escape the Fate, Max formed a band called Violent New Breed and released 2 demo tracks titled ""Here We Are"" and ""Freight Train"". After parting ways with Escape the Fate and a short stint with Falling in Reverse in 2014, Green began Violent New Breed the following year. Shortly after its launch, he gave a preview of the new project with several demos including ""Only the Strong Survive"", ""Casket Dream"" and ""Devil’s Deal"". In 2016, Violent New Breed set out on their first tour as well as issuing their debut six-song self-titled EP with Green as vocalist and rhythm guitarist, Mikey Alfero as lead guitarist, Brent Ashley as bassist and Glenn Crain as drummer. After a period of time off, the group announced this May that they would be returning with an entirely new lineup. Green as bassistbacking vocalist, Sean Russell as vocalislead guitarist, Shawn McGhee as rhythm guitarist and Charlie Nicholson as Drummer. The band marked their comeback by recruiting Light the Torch vocalist Howard Jones for “Bury Me” their first single off Bad Reputation. Following second single “Before I Fall” in August, they're now sharing a third, “Worth It.” The new track mixes emotion-tinged melodic vocals with face-melting riffs, striking the perfect balance. That balance was also felt in the studio, with Green revealing the production solidified his excitement in his new lineup. Days ahead of their premiere album release and the first collection of work with their new lineup, the band are now sharing “Crazy"" video The track opens with muted riffs before blasting into high-energy instrumentation with gritty vocals. The band's full-length, ""Bad Reputation"", released on October 25, 2019, via SBG Records. In late 2019, the lead singer left the band, leaving the band in a hiatus. In December 2021, the band posted on their Instagram a completely new line up, with Max still playing bass. On November 3, 2023, Violent New Breed announced they had broken up over creative differences.

He began managing them; he later managed the bands Witness the Forecast, and Secrets Kept in Suicide. In 2013 he produced the band The Culprit. In 2015 Green managed the band With Full Force.",Normal
"The Enterprise was an early steamboat operating on the Willamette River in Oregon and also one of the first to operate on the Fraser River in British Columbia. This vessel should not be confused with the many other vessels, some of similar design, also named Enterprise. In earlier times, this vessel was sometimes called Tom Wright's Enterprise after one of her captains, the famous Tom Wright. Enterprise was built at Canemah, Oregon in the fall of 1855 by Capt. Archibald Jamieson, Captain A.S. Murray, Amory Holbrook and John Torrence, in the fall of 1855, for the upper Willamette trade. Her officers on the first trip upriver to Corvallis (then known as Marysville) were: Jamieson, captain; Chandler, purser; and Torrence, engineer. George A. Pease was afterward employed as pilot, and John Marshall, engineer. From 1855 to 1858 Enterprise was operated on the Willamette River, running between Oregon City, Canemah, and Corvallis. At that time Corvallis was considered to be the head of navigation on the Willamette. Merchants above Corvallis tried to get Captain Jamieson to bring Enterprise, which he then commanded, above Corvallis, but he would not go farther than Orleans, then a small settlement on the east side of the river across from Corvallis. In July 1858, Jamieson sold Enterprise to Capt. Thomas A. Wright. Jamieson used the money from the sale of Enterprise to build the steamer Onward. Tom Wright became one of the most famous steamboat captains in the Pacific Northwest. Like Jamieson, Wright was one of a family in the steamboat business. His father was Capt. John T. Wright, who was the owner of other steamboats, such as Sea Bird and Commodore. The other two sons, also steamboat captains, were George S. Wright and John T. Wright, Jr. Tom Wright's plan for Enterprise was to take the vessel into British waters to serve the Fraser River Gold Rush. The first part of the journey began by moving Enterprise from the upper to the lower Willamette River by lining the vessel over Willamette Falls. These falls could not be navigated by steamboats, and indeed Captain Jamieson was later killed when a vessel under his command was accidentally swept over them and destroyed. Lining was procedure where a heavy cable was attached to the vessel, and then to a well-anchored windlass on shore. Little by little the cable would be let out to allow the vessel to gradually pass over the falls to the lower river. Wright then took Enterprise down the lower Willamette and Columbia rivers to Astoria, Oregon. Once there, Wright arranged for an ocean-going steamship to tow Enterprise to Victoria, British Columbia. Victoria, then the largest settlement on the Pacific Coast of North America north of San Francisco. Enterprise left Astoria under tow, but the strong waves on the Columbia Bar caused Enterprise to be so terribly racked that the vessel began leaking, and it was only by luck that they got Enterprise back into shallow water at Astoria before she sank. She was raised and repaired, and started again in August for Victoria, again under tow. Enterprise arrived in Victoria in the middle of August 1858. 'Other steamboats that arrived at Victoria at almost the same time that summer were Wilson G. Hunt, Martin White, and Maria. Enterprise with other American steamboats obtained a license from the governor of British Columbia to operate in British territory. Enterprise was the second steam-powered vessel to operate on the Fraser River, and had been brought up to Victoria in July 1858. The first vessel was another American steamer, the Umatilla ex Fashion from the Columbia River. Enterprise was very successful on the Fraser River, earning $25,000 in one trip up to Murderer's Bar, near Fort Hope, BC. 25,000 miners went into the Fraser diggings in the summer of 1858, but by the winter only 3,000 remained. With the drop in the population of miners, by the fall of 1858, Enterprise was one of only two steamboats operating on the Fraser River, the other being Maria, under Capt. William A. Lubbock. For a time at least, the two boats divided the traffic between them, with Maria running upriver from Fort Langley to Fort Hope and other points, and Enterprise running between Fort Langley and Victoria, on Vancouver Island. With a monopoly on transport, the two boats were able to raise freight rates from $4 to $7 per ton in the summer to $60 a ton. Beans that cost 3 cents a pound in Victoria cost 75 cents in Lytton, British Columbia. On December 9, 1858, Enterprise was caught in the ice on the Fraser River between Fort Hope and Fort Langley. The vessel was short on food and accommodations, and so 114 of the passengers decided to leave the steamer and walk the remaining distance to Fort Langley. In the cold weather, this proved a mistake, as they had inadequate clothing and insufficient clothing and camping provisions to make the journey. After three days in the ice, Captain Wright was able to hack the Enterprise free. He then cruised up and down the river, eventually rescuing all of the passengers, many of whom were suffering from frostbite. Enterprise built for the Willamette River was not strong enough to regularly cross the often stormy Strait of Georgia, which was the body of water that separated Vancouver Island from the mouth of the Fraser River on the mainland. The Wrights however had no choice in the matter if they were to remain in business, because the vessel they had been running on the route, the Sea Bird was destroyed by fire in the Strait of Georgia on September 7, 1858, while en route from Victoria to Fort Langley. By the spring of 1859, Capt. John T. Wright was able to replace Sea Bird by purchasing an interest in the sidewheeler Eliza Anderson, and arranging to have the Anderson brought from Portland, Oregon where she had been recently built, to Victoria, BC, where she arrived in late March, 1859. This allowed the Wrights to run the heavier more durable Anderson across the Straits to Fort Langley, while returning Enterprise to the 'Fraser River to make the run up from Fort Langley. On March 30, 1859, with Captain Tom Wright in command, Enterprise set out upriver from Fort Langley (after meeting the Anderson). The river was rising high with the rapidly melting snowfall, and with a new boiler installed in the Enterprise Captain Wright hoped to take the vessel all the way to Fort Yale. Only one other steamboat had ever made it to Fort Yale, the Umatilla which by then was no longer on the Fraser River. This time, Captain Wright was unable to go further up than Fort Hope. Enterprise was not powerful enough to beat the strong currents forming whirlpools in the river. Another constant hazard were logs caught in the river bottom, forming ""snags"" which could damage or destroy a steam vessel. To command a steamboat at a time when there were neither roads nor railroads in the Pacific Northwest was to be in a spectacular opportunity to earn money. Tom Wright never became rich because he could never settle down to running a vessel on a particular route for a sustained period of time. As soon as he mastered one route, he would be looking for another one. In June 1859 Captain Wright was ready to make another change. Hearing of homesteading activity beginning in the valley of the Chehalis River, in the western part of what is now Washington, Wright determined to take Enterprise to the Chehalis. This would require the lightly built Enterprise to be towed, in this case by the Eliza Anderson west through the Strait of Juan de Fuca and then south down the coast line of the Pacific Ocean to Grays Harbor. The Chehalis River flows into Grays Harbor on its eastern shore, near where the modern cities of Aberdeen and Hoquiam, Washington are now located. Wright begin this journey from Victoria on July 8, 1859, with Eliza Anderson towing Enterprise. In the Strait of Juan de Fuca Enterprise broke a shaft on her sternwheel, and the entire expedition was forced to turn back to Esquimalt, where Enterprise had to wait for a replacement shaft to be brought in from San Francisco. Enterprise was repaired by the end of July 1859, and by that time there was a demand for steamers to carry troops to the San Juan Islands. At that time the boundary between the United States and British Columbia was in dispute, with both countries claiming the San Juan Islands. British and American garrisons were established on San Juan Island. At one point a soldier shot a pig belonging to a partisan of the opposing country, and as a result the otherwise bloodless standoff became known as the Pig War. Steamboats in the area received contracts from both countries to move troops and supplies to the islands in connection with the dispute. Once Enterprise was repaired, Tom Wright postponed his plans to move the vessel to the Chehalis to take advantage of the increase in business, making a run on August 1, 1859, from Victoria to San Juan Island carrying passengers. Following the San Juan Island trip, Tom Wright was finally able to get Enterprise around Cape Flattery and south to Grays Harbor and the Chehalis River. Wright's plan had been to earn huge freight rates and passenger fares from what he had thought would be the booming population in the Chehalis valley, Wright worked Enterprise to the head of navigation on the Chehalis, sinking three times on the way. When he finally arrived at the headwaters, Wright found not a booming population ready to pay lots of money for steamboat service, but only five farmers who offered to sell Wright a few eggs, butter and vegetables for fifty dollars. Disgusted with the situation, Wright tied up the Enterprise and returned to Puget Sound. By the spring of 1860, Wright was able to arrange a government contract to transport troops down the Chehalis River to Grays Harbor, and so was able to recoup some of his losses. Once the government contract work expired, there was no further business in the Grays Harbor area. Unable to move the lightly built vessel again on the open ocean, Wright dismantled Enterprise at Grays Harbor, with the machinery being shipped to China.",Normal
"WMGO (1370 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a full service format. Licensed to Canton, Mississippi, United States, the station serves the Jackson, Mississippi area. The station is currently owned by WMGO Broadcasting Corp. On July 10, 1952, the Madison County Broadcasting Company, owned by Annie Dee Davis, James T. Ownby, and J. Dige Bishop, received a construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission for a new daytime-only radio station on 1370kHz at Canton. Originally broadcasting with 500 watts, WMGO began broadcasting in 1953; it was approved to increase power to 1,000 watts the next year. The original owners filed to transfer control of the station to W. E. Farrar, R. E. and Lucille Hook, and Hugh Hughes in 1956; Hook bought out Farrar and Hughes the next year. In 1963, the Hooks sold the station to Roy James Loflin, Jr., and Wilbur Rodney Williams. As the sale awaited completion, the station was briefly taken off-air in April when a tractor plowed into the transmission line; the engineer intervened in time to prevent the driver from touching the electrified wiring. The new owners relaunched the station as WMGO on July 9, 1963, from new studios. Two years later, they sold WMGO to the Canton Broadcasting Corporation. Under Canton Broadcasting ownership, the station continued to have an almost entirely White air staff, with the only Black personalities featured on Sunday mornings. Canton retained the station for more than 15 years, selling to two men from Fairhope, Alabama, in 1981; they owned the station until 1990, when it was sold to McCulloch. New investors were brought in in 1993. WMGO was joined by an FM sister station in 1997 when owner Jerry Lousteau built WMGO-FM 93.1, licensed to Yazoo City. In 2014, WMGO owner Lousteau revealed that political ads placed on the station against United States Senate candidate Chris McDaniel, linking him to the Ku Klux Klan, had been placed by a Democratic Party operative. WMGO also broadcasts short form local news simply branded as ""The Local Report"". The program focuses on local news, weather, and obituaries in Canton, and airs at 7, 8 and 9 AM, and at noon and is anchored by WMGO owner Jerry Lousteau. 1 = Audio for TV channel 6 (WJMF-LPInd) This article about a radio station in Mississippi is a stub.

"Antun Miletić (Serbian Cyrillic: Антун Милетић; born 30 June 1931) is a Yugoslav and Serbian historian. Miletić was born in Slavonski Brod, Croatia in 1931. He has been living in Belgrade since 28 November 1946. He spent five years as a student of the Military Academy and served as an officer of the Yugoslav People's Army until 31 December 1990, when he retired in the rank of colonel. In the late 1970s, as chief archivist of the Institute of Military History in Belgrade, Miletić was tasked with preparing a run-down of the history of the Jasenovac concentration camp for a new memorial at Gradina Donja headed by a Sarajevo-based team. Miletić scoured the archives of the Institute for camp-related documents and continued his work at the behest of the Jasenovac memorial site, who showed interest in its contents. The result was the publication in the mid-1980s of some 400 documents over three volumes published jointly by the Jasenovac Memorial Area and Narodna Knjiga, a Belgrade publishing house. The work is considered a leading monograph on the camp. It includes material on the camp's administration and documents from former inmates, Ustaše guards and official commissions that investigated war crimes. Miletić does not provide his own estimates on the number of people killed in the camp, but appears to agree with the 600,000 to 700,000 figures given during the Yugoslav communist era. In 2010 Miletić estimated that a minimum of 146,401 or 146,248 people died at Jasenovac based on varying name lists and numbers. Miletić was one of the most active members of the committee of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts for the collection of documents on the Genocide against Serbs and other peoples in Yugoslavia in the 20th century, from 1986 to 1994, when the committee ceased its work. With his colleague Vladimir Dedijer, Miletić wrote about what he saw as a Genocide of Bosnian Muslims committed by the Chetniks during World War II in a volume entitled Genocid nad Muslimanima published in 1990. He was a member of the Historical committee of the Russell's Tribunal for Yugoslavia and is a founding member and Chairman of the Association for Research into Genocide and the war crimes, founded in Belgrade. In 2002 Miletić was elected a member of the Directors of the Jasenovac Research Institute. Miletić has published 24 books, over 60 papers and dozens of articles and serials in daily and weekly press. He has also participated in numerous other projects as collaborator, editor, reviewer and member of editorial boards.",Normal

"Sakka or Saqqa (Arabic: سكا) is a village to the southeast of Damascus, on the edge of the Ghouta, 5 kilometres (3.1mi) north west of Damascus International Airport in Syria. Tell Sakka is a man-made tell in the neighborhood that has been excavated by Ahmed Taraqji on behalf of the Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums. Remains of a palace was found and dated to between 1800 and 1600 BCE. It has provided evidence of Egyptian influence in the Ghouta, The architectural remains were said to resemble those of Qatna and along with pottery were dated to the Middle Bronze Age. A courtyard was excavated measuring 14.5 metres (48ft) by 22.5 metres (74ft). Columns marked the entrance to the south and four large columns were positioned in a square in the centre of the courtyard. Tempera or perhaps Fresco technique Paintings were found on the walls showing ancient Egyptian style and motifs. However, beneath the apparent Egyptian scheme, a Near-Eastern tradition is evident in the ideas of the paintings. The first cuneiform tablet recovered in the Damascus area was found at Tell Sakka. It was suggested resemble the style of cuneiform found in the archives of Mari and speaks of a king called Zimri-Lim. The cuneiform tablet in Sakka was translated to read ""To my brother Zimri-lim, say ""Thus saith Kanhilesu? Your brothers Samas and Dagan for the rest of the days, My brother sustenance?

"Bonaparte à Malte is a 2008 book by Maltese writer Frans Sammut, with an introduction by Dr Paul Borg Olivier. The Maltese original, Bonaparti f'Malta, was published in 1997. Citing contemporary documents from Malta's archives, it provides a detailed account of the six days Napoleon Bonaparte spent in Malta in 1798, as well as an analysis of the political situation under the Order of St John of Jerusalem and the political and cultural consequences of Bonaparte's conquest of Malta. In the words of fellow writer and former Prime Minister of Malta, Alfred Sant, Napoleon and his impact on Malta were ""enduring subjects of  interests and research"". It is the first account in the French language of those six days. At the Eighth Congress of the International Napoleonic Society, Sammut gave a presentation, ""The Enlightenment in Malta and the Coming of Bonaparte"", based on his research for Bonaparte à Malte. Sammut maintained that Napoleon, despite spending such a short time in Malta, sought singlehandedly to draw the country into the modern world. He issued a series of decrees aimed at bringing about a thorough reorganization of government and society in Malta, and tirelessly sought to review the country's laws and regulations. The abolition of noble titles and privileges and the ending of slavery were the first measures he implemented. He ordered the expulsion of the Inquisitor and the release of the Order's political prisoners, including the Maltese patriot, Mikiel Anton Vassalli, who shared his Enlightenment ideals and whom he described as ""the most intelligent prisoner (ever) locked in a cell"". Voicing his surprise that fundamental subjects such as mathematics, physics and astronomy were not yet being taught at the University of Malta, he also instituted a series of educational reforms. Sammut characterized Napoleon as ""a different kind of leader... more of an intellectual strategist and philosopher"", a quality placing him in the highest rank of commander together with Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great. Some of Sammut's research for Bonaparte à Malte also went into his 1994 historical novel about Vassalli, Il-Ħolma Maltija (The Maltese Dream), described by Alfred Sant as ""his masterpiece"" and by British author and poet Marjorie Boulton as ""a colossal work"". According to Prof. Anne-Marie Mésa of the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Frans Sammut's ""point of view is actually original, well reasoned out, nuanced and subtle – as one would expect from all works on history. A true pleasure to read!”; Frans Sammut was “self-evidently an excellent historian, as well as a rich personality and endowed with a vast culture”.",Normal

"Da Loria Norman (1872–1935) was an American artist. Norman was noted for painting and for her illumination of books and images, and partnered with leading English artists such as Walter Crane. One of her most significant commissions was the illumination of ""Ecclesiastes and the Song of Solomon"", a Ballantyne Press vellum edition designed by Charles Ricketts, for the Spencer Bequest of the New York Public Library. Norman's work is held in the Smithsonian American Art Museum, among other collections. Born Belle Mitchell in Kansas, she moved to England during her childhood, where she married, had children, and began her artistic career. Belle's marriage was not a happy one, and she left her husband several times with her children to live with her friend Adah Franks. After her divorce, she changed her name to da Loria, and embraced a life of art and mysticism. Inspired by 15th-century manuscript illumination, a contemporary review of her work noted that the ""quality of her illumination is unquestionable, her technique truly remarkable"". She became a member of the London branch of the Theosophical Society in 1914. At the outbreak of World War I, Norman returned to the United States in 1914, where she lived in Old Lyme, Connecticut, and New York City. She died in New York City in 1935.",Normal

"Eigenmode expansion (EME) is a computational electrodynamics modelling technique. It is also referred to as the mode matching technique or the bidirectional eigenmode propagation method (BEP method). Eigenmode expansion is a linear frequency-domain method. It offers very strong benefits compared with FDTD, FEM and the beam propagation method for the modelling of optical waveguides, and it is a popular tool for the modelling linear effects in fiber optics and silicon photonics devices. Eigenmode expansion is a rigorous technique to simulate electromagnetic propagation which relies on the decomposition of the electromagnetic fields into a basis set of local eigenmodes that exists in the cross section of the device. The eigenmodes are found by solving Maxwell's equations in each local cross-section. The method can be fully vectorial provided that the mode solvers themselves are fully vectorial. In a typical waveguide, there are a few guided modes (which propagate without coupling along the waveguide) and an infinite number of radiation modes (which carry optical power away from the waveguide). The guided and radiation modes together form a complete basis set. Many problems can be resolved by considering only a modest number of modes, making EME a very powerful method. As can be seen from the mathematical formulation, the algorithm is inherently bi-directional. It uses the scattering matrix (S-matrix) technique to join different sections of the waveguide or to model nonuniform structures. For structures that vary continuously along the z-direction, a form of z-discretisation is required. Advanced algorithms have been developed for the modelling of optical tapers. In a structure where the optical refractive index does not vary in the z direction, the solutions of Maxwell's equations take the form of a plane wave: We assume here a single wavelength and time dependence of the form exp ⁡ ( i ω t ) {displaystyle exp(iomega t)} . Mathematically E ( x , y ) e i β z {textstyle E(x,y)e^{ibeta z}} and β {displaystyle beta } are the eigenfunction and eigenvalues of Maxwell's equations for conditions with simple harmonic z-dependence. We can express any solution of Maxwell's equations in terms of a superposition of the forward and backward propagating modes: E ( x , y , z ) = ∑ k = 1 M ( a k e i β k z + b k e − i β k z ) E k ( x , y ) {displaystyle E(x,y,z)=sum _{k=1}^{M}{left(a_{k}e^{ibeta _{k}z}+b_{k}e^{-ibeta _{k}z}right)E_{k}(x,y)}} H ( x , y , z ) = ∑ k = 1 M ( a k e i β k z − b k e − i β k z ) H k ( x , y ) {displaystyle H(x,y,z)=sum _{k=1}^{M}{left(a_{k}e^{ibeta _{k}z}-b_{k}e^{-ibeta _{k}z}right)H_{k}(x,y)}} These equations provide a rigorous solution of Maxwell's equations in a linear medium, the only limitation being the finite number of modes. When there is a change in the structure along the z-direction, the coupling between the different input and output modes can be obtained in the form of a scattering matrix. The scattering matrix of a discrete step can be obtained rigorously by applying the boundary conditions of Maxwell's equations at the interface; this requires calculation of the modes on both sides of the interface and their overlaps. For continuously varying structures (e.g. tapers), the scattering matrix can be obtained by discretising the structure along the z-axis.",Normal

"Point Lonsdale is a coastal township on the Bellarine Peninsula, near Queenscliff, Victoria, Australia. The town is divided between the Borough of Queenscliffe and the City of Greater Geelong. Point Lonsdale is also one of the headlands which, with Point Nepean, frame The Rip, the entrance to Port Phillip. The headland is dominated by the Point Lonsdale Lighthouse. At the 2016 census, Point Lonsdale had a population of 2,684. The population grows rapidly over the summer months through to the Easter period due to its popularity as a holiday destination. The traditional owners of this area are the Wautharong people of the Kulin nation. The escaped convict William Buckley, the first known European to have lived in the area, lived with local Aborigines from 1803 to 1835. A signal station was built in 1854. Permanent European settlement began at Point Lonsdale in the latter half of the 19th century with the construction of a lighthouse in 1863 and the extension of the railway line from Geelong to Queenscliff in 1879. Since settlement, many ships have been wrecked on the rocky reefs at the entrance to Port Phillip. The post office opened on 15 January 1902. The town is named after police officer William Lonsdale and is the birthplace of former Premier of Victoria Thomas Hollway. Point Lonsdale contains several Victorian Heritage Register listed sites, including: Next to the town is Lake Victoria, a shallow saline lake that is part of the Lonsdale Lakes Nature Reserve and an important site for the waterbirds and migratory waders that form part of the population using the Ramsar-listed Swan Bay wetland system. The coastal rock platforms and adjacent waters are included in the Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park. The intertidal platforms have the highest invertebrate diversity of any calcarenite reef in Victoria, while subtidal areas are characterised by diverse and abundant algal communities as well as by encrusting organisms such as ascidians, sponges and bryozoans. Along the open coast there are regular sightings of threatened marine mammals such as humpback and southern right whales. Point Lonsdale has a large 100-year-old Norfolk Pine 'The Christmas Tree' that is lit up on the first Saturday in December at the end of an evening of A Community Celebration of Christmas. The Community Celebration of Christmas is run by a committee of volunteers assisted by the local service clubs, Lions and Rotary. The focus of the event is the community and children and each year the lights are turned on by a special guest (or guests) of honour chosen for their contribution to the Community. The Borough of Queenscliffe has a high percentage of volunteers and it is usually volunteers that are chosen as the special guestguests of honour in recognition of their contribution to the community. Santa arrives at 7:25 pm in the local Fire Brigade Truck, whilst throwing lollies to the children, to start an evening of entertainment by local performers. Glowcandles are sold as a fundraiser for maintaining equipment on the tree with all profits supporting the ongoing lighting of the tree. The tree itself is decorated by community volunteers and service club members coordinated by The Christmas Tree Committee. Festooning is hauled up by hand and manually secured into the tree. This tree can be found at the corner of Grimes Road and Point Lonsdale Rd, Point Lonsdale, Victoria. When lit up this tree can be seen for miles out to sea and is a Queenscliffe Borough icon, having been lit since about 1952–1953. When the lights are on you know Christmas is getting close. The township of Point Lonsdale has also been used in some episodes of the hit children's series Round the Twist for some of the exterior scenes. Golfers play at the course of the Lonsdale Links Golf Club on Fellows Road, rated a Top 20 course in Australia, after undergoing a major renovation. Bowlers bowl at the Point Lonsdale Bowling Club.

"San Domenico is a Gothic-style, Roman Catholic church and convent located on Via San Domenico #1 in the town of Chieri, Province of Turin, region of Piedmont, Italy. Initially, the Dominicans had been welcomed at the end of the 13th-century to Chieri by the Broglia family. Construction of the church and convent began in the 14th-century, and over the next hundred years, chapels for wealthy families were added to the temple. The lateral windows have an organic rounded shape but the walls contain protruding pilasters that buttress the walls and facade; each pilaster ends in a spire. The interior columns have bicoloured horizontal striations. On the lateral walls of the choir, above the wooden stalls, are two large canvases depicting the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes and a Resurrection of Lazarus by Guglielmo Caccia. The Chapel of the Rosary contains a canvas with the Virgin and Child and the Story of the Rosary also by il Moncalvo. The first chapel on the left houses copies of a Deposition by Gaudenzio Ferrari and of a painting by Guercino. The original of the latter is housed in the church of San Domenico, Turin.

"Andorra has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest six times, debuting in the 2004 contest and participating every year thereafter until the 2009 contest. To date, Andorra remains the only nation to have never competed in a final, with its best result being a 12th-place finish in the 2007 contest's semi-final. Andorra withdrew from the contest following its 2009 appearance, with the national broadcaster Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra (RTVA) citing financial difficulties as the reason for its withdrawal. The country has not entered the contest again since. Interest in the contest has, however, remained high in the country, while statements from the Andorran government and broadcaster indicated that a future return was possible, depending on financial backing. RTVA used a mixture of methods to select its entrants in the years it competed, employing a national final for 2004, 2005 and 2009 and selecting internally between 2006 and 2008. A televote was principally used to determine the nation's points, however, due to the country's small population, on occasion a jury was required as the number of votes received from the Andorran public was deemed too low to be considered valid. Participation in the Eurovision Song Contest is open to members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), of which Andorra has been a member since 2002 through Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra (RTVA). Interest in Andorran participation in the contest was first raised in 2003, when the country's then-head of government Marc Forné Molné indicated his agreement for the country to enter the contest, seeing it as a way to raise their profile at a reasonable cost. Andorra Televisió subsequently broadcast that year's contest as a passive participant, a prerequisite step for participation in the following year's event under the rules of the contest in place at the time. RTVA later confirmed its intention to submit an entry for the 2004 contest, with backing from the Andorran government and an assurance that the Catalan language would be represented in the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time. For its first Eurovision appearance, an agreement was announced between RTVA and Televisió de Catalunya (TVC) to jointly organise Andorra's first national final, with viewers in Catalonia being given a say in who should represent the country in the 2004 contest. Viewers and an assembled jury subsequently chose Marta Roure with ""Jugarem a estimar-nos"" as Andorra's first entry; ultimately the nation did not fare well, placing 18th of the 22 participating countries in the semi-final, receiving 12 points in total, all from Spain, and failing to qualify for the grand final. After debating employing an internal selection to determine Andorra's second entry, a second national final was organised ahead of the 2005 contest. Marian van de Wal was chosen to perform ""La mirada interior"" at the contest, however Andorra once again failed to qualify for the final, placing 23rd of 25 countries in the 2005 semi-final with 27 points. RTVA initiated an internal selection to determine its entry for the 2006 contest, selecting ""Sense tu"" performed by Jenny; the nation's third appearance would bring its worst result to date, placing last in the semi-final and receiving just eight points. Further internal selections followed in 2007 and 2008, however neither Anonymous nor Gisela could bring Andorra to the final in either of the contests. RTVA reverted to a national final for the 2009 contest, with Susanne Georgi selected by the Andorran public and jury to represent the country with ""La teva decisió (Get a Life)""; on its sixth appearance, Andorra continued to fail to pass through the semi-final, placing 15th in the first semi-final with eight points and failing to qualify for the final. After initially applying to take part in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo, Norway, RTVA subsequently announced its withdrawal from the contest, citing financial difficulties. Budget restrictions have continued to prevent Andorra from returning to the contest, with RTVA having previously considered leaving the EBU in order to recoup costs, which would have prevented any further Andorran participation in the event. In recent years, renewed interest in the contest has been reported among some members of the Andorran government, with past Andorran Eurovision artists having also been vocal in their support for a return of the nation to the contest. Georgi, Andorra's last participant, also started a campaign to secure a potential sponsorship which would enable Andorra to return to the contest and lobbied with Andorran politicians on this idea. Andorra is the only country to have never participated in a final to date; 2007 remains the country's best result to date, when Anonymous placed 12th in that year's semi-final with 80 points, 11 points away from qualifying. Andorra has used a mix of methods to select its entries for the contest, having employed both national finals and internal selections. For its debut entry, RTVA launched a casting show, Eurocàsting, to determine two acts to take part in the national final. The selected acts performed 12 potential Eurovision songs over nine weeks on 12 punts, with songs being eliminated weekly until the winning song and artist was determined in the final show. Eurocàsting returned in 2005, but with one winning artist selected to perform three songs in the single final show Desitja'm sort. Following internal selections between 2006 and 2008, RTVA employed a televised competition again in 2009, with three acts competing in Passaport a Moscou. In the years where Andorra participated, voting at the Eurovision Song Contest typically consisted of 100 percent public televoting, with countries obligated to use televoting as the method for determining their points from the 2004 contest. However, each country was obligated to assemble a back-up jury, whose votes would be used instead of the televote in cases of technical failure, or from 2005 when the number of televotes registered failed to pass a certain threshold. RTVA utilised SMS voting to determine the country's points during the shows in which Andorra participated, however on occasion the back-up jury results were required to be implemented as the number of votes received was considered too low to provide a valid result. This occurred in 2005 and 2007, when the votes of Andorra's back-up jury were used instead to provide the Andorran votes in both the semi-final and final. The public broadcaster of each participating country in the Eurovision Song Contest assigns a head of delegation as the EBU's contact person and the leader of their delegation at the event. The delegation, whose size can greatly vary, includes a head of press, the contestants, songwriters, composers and backing vocalists, among others. For the show's broadcast on Andorra Televisió (ATV), various commentators have provided commentary for the contest in the local language. At the Eurovision Song Contest after all points are calculated, the presenters of the show call upon each voting country to invite each respective spokesperson to announce the results of their vote on-screen.",Normal

"The Light Rail Transit Authority (LRTA) is a public transport operator that is responsible for the construction, operation, maintenance andor lease of Manila Light Rail Transit System in the Philippines. It is organized as a government-owned and controlled corporation under the Department of Transportation (DOTr) as an attached agency. The results of a fourteen-month study conducted between 1976 and 1977 by Freeman Fox and Associates suggested a street-level light rail line in Manila. These proposals were revised by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, later the Department of Transportation (DOTr), to an elevated system in order to avoid building in the city's many intersections. On July 12, 1980, President Ferdinand Edralin Marcos created the Light Rail Transit Authority through Executive Order No. 603, and assigned First Lady and Governor of Metro Manila Imelda Marcos as its chairman. While the LRTA confined its roles to policy making, fare regulation, and future planning, LRT Line 1's operations were assigned to Meralco Transit Organization (Metro, Inc.), a sister company of Meralco. The line came to be referred to as Metrorail. Construction of Line 1 began in September 1981. The section from Baclaran to Central Terminal was opened on December 1, 1984, with all remaining stations opening on May 12, 1985. On August 1, 2000, LRTA assumed the operational responsibility after employees of METRO, Inc. hosted a wildcat strike that paralyzed the line's operations from July 25 to August 2, 2000. With Japan's ODA amounting to 75 billion yen in total, the construction of Line 2 began in 1996, and the first section of the line, from Santolan to Araneta Center-Cubao, was opened on April 5, 2003. The remaining stations opened exactly a year later, except for Recto station which opened on October 29, 2004. In January 2017, LRTA Administrator Gen. Reynaldo I. Berroya (Ret.) announced the plan to establish a railway school in the country to improve the technical skills of LRTA employees and serve as a training ground for them. In May 2018, LRTA launched the first-ever train simulator manufactured by Lander Simulations and Training Solutions of Spain. (thru PPP scheme) The Board of Directors is composed of eight ex-officio cabinet members namely the Secretary of the DOTr as Chairman, the respective Secretaries of the DPWH, DBM, DOF and NEDA, the Chairman of the MMDA and the LTFRB and the Administrator of the LRTA and one representative from the private sector. The Board is tasked to issue, prescribe, and adopt policies, programs, plans, standards, guidelines, procedures, rules, and regulations for implementation, enforcement, and application by the LRTA Management. The Board also convenes to resolve operations-related issues and concerns and other matters requiring immediate attention and resolution. During the presidency of Pres. Benigno Aquino III, on October 2, 2014, the Department of Transportation and Light Rail Transit Authority signed a 32-year concession agreement with Light Rail Manila Corporation, a private consortium composed of AC Infra, Metro Pacific Light Rail Corporation and Macquarie Group for the Line 1 Operations & Maintenance, construction of the Cavite Extension and Capacity Expansion. Under the concession agreement, LRMC is responsible for the Operations & Maintenance of Line 1 and construction of the Cavite Extension while LRTA is responsible for procuring 120 new light rail vehicles for the Capacity Expansion and acquisition of the Right-of-way for the Cavite Extension. On 4 December 2019, a fact-finding committee was formed by then-Administrator Gen. Reynaldo I. Berroya (Ret.) to review several LRT Line 2 contracts. On 21 January 2021, the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission found inconsistencies in the procurement of equipment for the worth ₱170.3 million. The documents showed that re-railing and rolling stock diagnostic equipment for Line 2 were different from the specified brand in the bidding. The crate containing the re-railing equipment showed a sticker printout that it was shipped by Chinese firm CRRC Corporation, as ordered by the joint venture of Kempal Construction and Supply Corporation. However, documents showed that it was manufactured by Bemco, an Indian company. Irregularities were also seen in the procurement of escalators delivered by Ma-an Construction Inc. and IFE Elevators Inc, wherein the capacity of the escalators were 6,000 persons per hour, short of the required 9,000 persons per hour capacity. LRTA officials stated on 23 January that they will submit an initial report to the PACC. On 7 December 2021, LRTA filed corruption cases against some LRTA and DBM officials. DOTr Secretary Arthur Tugade has then ordered the review of other LRT-2 rehabilitation projects and blacklisting of the joint venture of Ma-an Construction Inc. and IFE Elevators Inc. The escalators and elevators were later fixed by January 2022 as one of the priority projects of the agency.",Normal

"The Robin Avenue Bridge is located east of Carroll, Iowa, United States. The 46-foot (14m) span carries traffic on Robin Avenue over an unnamed stream. This bridge was one of 15 similar spans that Carroll County had built in 1913. The county board of supervisors contracted with the Standard Bridge Company of Omaha to build the Warren pony truss structures that were designed by the Iowa State Highway Commission (ISHC). They were supported by a timber substructure. The bridges became the prototype of what would become the ISHC's standard design. Standard Bridge was paid $29,174 to build all the bridges, which included the costs for this bridge at $1,208. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.

"The Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway was a railway company that operated in the U.S. states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia. It began as the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, chartered in Nashville on December 11, 1845, built to 5ft (1,524mm) gauge and was the first railway to operate in the state of Tennessee. By the turn of the twentieth century, the NC&StL grew into one of the most important railway systems in the southern United States.: iii, Dedication The Nashville & Chattanooga Railway, predecessor to the NC&StL Railway, was organized in 1848 by a group of prominent Nashville businessmen. The line's first president was Vernon K. Stevenson, who was connected to wealth from the Grundy and Bass families of Nashville and was a vigorous promotor of a line between Nashville and Chattanooga; he would serve for 16 years. The first locomotive in Nashville arrived in December 1850 on the steamboat Beauty along with 13 freight cars and one passenger car. The train made its first trip the following spring: 11 miles (18km) to Antioch, Tennessee. It took nine years to complete the 150 miles (240km) of line between Nashville and Chattanooga, made difficult by the steep elevations of the Highland Rim and Cumberland Plateau between them. The 2,228-foot (679m) Cowan Tunnel near Cowan, Tennessee, was considered an engineering marvel of the time. Due to terrain difficulties, the rail line crossed into Alabama and Georgia for short distances. Towns sprang up during construction, including Tullahoma and Estill Springs. During the Civil War, the rail line was strategic to both the Union and Confederate armies. The Tennessee campaigns of 1862 and 1863 saw Union troops force the Confederates from Nashville all the way to Chattanooga, down the line of the railroad. The tracks and bridges were repeatedly damaged and repaired, and the rolling stock was largely destroyed. At different times the trains carried supplies for both armies. In 1885, the railroad successfully defended itself before the Supreme Court in Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. United States from repaying postage payments for mail in 1861 that was not delivered because of the war. After the war. the company purchased the Nashville and Northwestern Railroad and the Hickman and Obion Railroad to Hickman, Kentucky, to reach the Mississippi River. In 1873, it was reincorporated as the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway (NC&StL); the company's tracks never actually reached St. Louis, Missouri, in the north. In early 1877, the NC&StL bought the bankrupt Tennessee and Pacific Railroad from the state government and operated it as a connection to Lebanon, Tennessee. The company also took full control of the Duck River Valley Narrow Gauge Railway in 1888, converting it to standard gauge the following year. It had already leased the line, which linked Columbia, Lewisburg, and Fayetteville, Tennessee from its owners in 1879, when they had difficulty completing the final stretch into Fayetteville. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad, an aggressive competitor of the NC&StL, gained a controlling interest in 1880 through a hostile stock takeover that caused much rancor between the cities of Nashville and Louisville. However, the railroads continued to operate separately until finally merging in 1957. The company gave up steam operations in 1953. After the 1880 takeover, the NC&StL acquired branch lines in Kentucky and Alabama, and expanded from Nashville to Memphis. In 1890 the tracks reached Atlanta, Georgia, by leasing the state-owned Western and Atlantic Railroad.: List of Branches in Order of Their Acquisition In 1902, the L&N was acquired by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in a takeover similar to that of the NC&StL, but continued to operate as a separate company. In 1982, the L&N's corporate existence ended when it was merged into ACL's successor, the Seaboard System Railroad. After several other mergers, in 1986 the Seaboard System was renamed CSX Transportation, which continues to use the original NC&StL route between Nashville, Chattanooga, and Atlanta. Other portions of the system, such as the route to Hickman, have been abandoned. At the end of 1925 NC&StL operated 1,259 miles of road on 1,859 miles of track; at the end of 1956, mileages were 1,043 and 1,791. The railroad's named passenger trains included: The railroad came to be advertised as the ""Dixie Line"", beginning in the 1920s. The railroad also operated the Quickstep (name dropped before 1910, then known as Nos. 3 and 4), Georgian, City of Memphis, Volunteer, an unnamed night train (formerly the Memphis Limited), a Nashville-Hickman local, plus a through sleeping car from the Tennessean on Nos. 3 and 4, a Chicago-to-Augusta, Georgia, train. Another part of the train split at Chattanooga and continued as a Southern Railway operation through eastern Tennessee, and onward to Washington and the Northeast Corridor. The railroad also operated unnamed trains between Nashville and Atlanta via Chattanooga, between Memphis and Paducah, Kentucky, between Dickson and Hohenwald, between Nashville and Hickman, Kentucky, via Union City, between Decherd and Huntsville, Alabama, and other short routes. Two 4-4-0 locomotives from the NC&StL's predecessor road, the Western and Atlantic are on display in museums: The General and The Texas are in the Atlanta suburbs of Kennesaw and Buckhead. In 1953, the NC&StL donated its last steam engine, No. 576, to the city of Nashville. Originally known as a Yellow Jacket, the J3-57-class 4-8-4 locomotive was manufactured by the American Locomotive Company (""Alco"") in 1942. The NC&StL referred to their 4-8-4s as Dixies, while most other railroads called them Northerns. It has been on display in Centennial Park since then. In 2016, the city of Nashville allowed the Nashville Steam Preservation Society to take out a 23-year renewable lease on the locomotive. The locomotive is currently at the Tennessee Central Railway Museum under restoration to working order and use for weekend excursion runs from downtown Nashville east to Watertown. Two other NC&StL steamers survive, 0-4-0Ts that used to work in the shops. They are stored in Taylorsville and are in either private ownership or abandoned. They appear to still have yellow-painted handrails. In 2004, a former NC&StL EMD GP7 diesel locomotive, No. 710, was restored to its original paint scheme by the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum. The TVRM also has the tail car from the city of Memphis on display at its Grand Junction Yard in Chattanooga. In 2007, Huntsville terminal switcher No. 100, a former NC&StL GE 44-ton Diesel (1950) was moved from Mt. Pleasant to the Cowan Railroad Museum in Cowan. Though subsequently an L&N engine (number 3100), she was cosmetically restored to original scheme and number. In the process, the locomotive was found to be runnable. It is important as the first transistorized remote-control locomotive in the U.S. (converted in 1962).",Normal

"The Phoenician sanctuary of Kharayeb (Arabic: معبد الخرايب الفينيقي) is a historic temple in the hinterland of Tyre in Southern Lebanon. It was excavated in three stages. In 1946, Maurice Chehab, then head of Lebanon's Directorate General of Antiquities, led the first mission that revealed a Hellenistic period temple and thousands of clay figurines dating from the sixth to the first century BC. Subsequent excavations in 1969, by Lebanese archaeologist Brahim Kaoukabani, and in 2009, by the Italian government, yielded evidence of cultic practices and produced a detailed reconstruction of the sanctuary's architecture. The sanctuary's origins date back to the 6th century BC, with the establishment of rural agricultural centers by the growing city of Tyre. Initially, a temple was likely constructed from perishable materials, with only fragments of stone cultic statues surviving from this phase. Around three centuries later, during the Hellenistic period, a new and larger building replaced the original structure. This Hellenistic temple was fronted by a paved courtyard and consisted of a square hall leading to a smaller rectangular room. The interior was embellished with stucco, a central mosaic flooring and gem-like glass paste wall decorations. The exterior featured a cavetto cornice, a lintel featuring a sun disk with two uraei (representations of a sacred snake used as a symbol of sovereignty and divinity in Ancient Egypt), and the entrance was flanked by two standing Egyptian-style male figure statues. The architecture followed pre-Classical Phoenician temple design, characterized by specific features such as a ""bent-entry"", and an east-west axis orientation. The sanctuary yielded a collection of artifacts, including thousands of terracotta figurines and miniature vessels, and inscriptions, which provide insights into the religious practices of the local rural Phoenician population. The terracotta figurines from the Iron Age II and Persian periods depicted various subjects, including pregnant women, male figures, and deities. During the Hellenistic period, new molding techniques introduced Greek themes and images of deities like Aphrodite and Hermes. The religious practices observed at the sanctuary remained faithful to local Phoenician traditions, and were part of a wider cultic system within the Tyre hinterland, involving similar rituals across different sanctuaries in the region. The deity to whom the sanctuary was dedicated remains unidentified because the unearthed inscriptions lack specific god names. Numerous child figurines unearthed during the excavations suggest that the sanctuary served as a small rural religious site focused on healing and salvation deities, with rituals associated with childbearing and childhood. The discovery of around 8,000 terracotta figurines indicates intensive religious activity spanning centuries, ending when the site's religious activity ceased in the first century BC. The sanctuary is located on a hilly plateau at the entrance of the homonymous town, near the locality of Jemjim. The modern town of Kharayeb sits on the hills overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, a short distance north of the Leontes River, 77km (48mi) south of Beirut, Lebanon. The Kharayeb sanctuary was within the territorial boundaries of the Phoenician city of Tyre, whose territory extended along the Levantine coast from Sarepta in the north to Sykaminon in the south during the Persian period, as documented in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax dating to c. 350 BC. Archaeological excavation in Kharayeb and its vicinity have revealed a complex settlement landscape spanning various chronological periods, from the Prehistoric to the Ottoman period. The region had been inhabited since the Middle Paleolithic, as evidenced by numerous discovered flint tools. The earliest signs of agricultural use of the area comes from the archaeological site of Jemjim, where excavations have revealed a rural settlement with a complex system of cisterns dating to the Iron Age, along with ceramics indicating occupation dating to the second millennium BC. During the Persian period, when Phoenicia was under Achaemenid rule, the Phoenician economy flourished and the coastal cities' population grew, necessitating resource optimization in their respective territories. The Persians supported this development by promoting intensive agriculture and irrigation. The subsistence of the city of Tyre was ensured by the establishment of rural agricultural centers, extending from the Phoenician coast to Mount Carmel in Palestine (modern day Israel). These rural areas, especially those situated near rivers, played a crucial role in Tyre's economy and witnessed the emergence of a series of planned settlements. It is within this territorial organization context that the construction of a place of worship in Kharayeb was begun around the 6th century BC. The establishment of the sanctuary of Kharayeb along a river, and in a relatively isolated context occurred during a time when cults of deities of healing and salvation were emerging throughout the Levant. Following Alexander the Great's conquest of the Persian Empire in 330 BC and his premature death, various Hellenistic kingdoms emerged across the conquered land, namely the Seleucid Empire in West Asia and Ptolemaic Egypt. Greek culture and language spread as far as modern-day India, resulting in a fusion of ancient Greek and local cultures. In Phoenicia, despite the prevailing use of the Phoenician language, the institutions and organizational structures of the coastal cities exhibited a pronounced Hellenistic influence. This influence is less detectable in the inland rural regions. During this period, the sanctuary was completely rebuilt. Concurrently, a surge in the utilization of Greek- and Ptolemaic Egypt-inspired imagery, subjects, and artistic motifs emerged in the heavily Hellenized coastal Phoenician cities.. Inscriptions in the sanctuary of Kharayeb, all written in Phoenician, indicate the rural population's persistent adherence to their native language, and traditional religious practices. The same conclusion could be drawn from the predominantly Phoenician inscriptions in the nearby sanctuary of Umm al-Amad. No archaeological evidence dating from later than the end of the Hellenistic period has been uncovered in the sanctuary area, suggesting that cultic activity at the sanctuary ceased, after a long period of prosperity and intensive use, in the first century BC. The region encompassing Kharayeb yielded a number of ancient artifacts, attracting the attention of scholars and explorers since the 19th century. In April 1863, a marble slab featuring intricate relief sculpture, believed to be a fragment of a door frame, was discovered among the construction materials of a house in Jemjim. The slab was acquired by local treasure hunter Alphonse Durighello. In the relief, a seated female figure is depicted wearing a pschent, an Ancient Egyptian double crown, and she holds an incense burner. The right edge of the slab is decorated with Phoenician palmette motifs. In his book Mission de Phénicie, French biblical scholar and orientalist Ernest Renan reported the discovery as being from the town of ""Djamdjîne"" (Jemjim). The locals of Kharayeb referred to the area where the Phoenician sanctuary was later discovered as Juret el-Khawatem ('the pit of the rings'); this name derives from the practice of collecting what they thought were beads unearthed on the premises. They then fashioned their finds into bracelets and various decorative accessories. In 1946, the head of Lebanon's Directorate General of Antiquities Service Maurice Chehab, initiated excavations at Juret el-Khawatem, prompted by the discovery of a number of figurines made from terracotta. He unearthed the remains of a rectangular cultic building dating to the Hellenistic period. In front of the building, near a paved courtyard, he uncovered a favissa (a sacred underground deposit) containing thousands of clay figurines dating from the sixth to the first centuries BC. In 1969, Lebanese archaeologist Brahim Kaoukabani resumed excavations of the site. He unearthed various figurines, significant architectural elements, including a lintel adorned with uraei (representations of a sacred snake), and two large statues that exhibited an Egyptian style attire. Kaoukabani published his preliminary excavation report in 1973. In 2009, the Italian government funded the reexamination and study of the sanctuary's clay figurines in the collections of the General Directorate of Antiquities in Beirut, and in November 2013, a new excavation project in the Kharayeb sanctuary site and its vicinity. The mission team was led by archaeologists Ida Oggiano from Italy and Wissam Khalil from Lebanon. Several significant discoveries ensued, including a previously undiscovered section of the main rectangular cultic building. The Italian mission made a detailed reconstruction of the sanctuary, revealing the various developmental stages of the cultic building. The team digitally reconstructed original architectural embellishments of the Hellenistic structure, showcasing intricate designs featuring colored mosaic tesserae, stucco, and glass ornaments. The sanctuary of Kharayeb follows the pre-Classical Phoenician temple design, the predominant temple type in Phoenicia and its dependencies. Iron Age Phoenician temples followed a similar plan, with distinct characteristics that set them apart from other cultic architecture in the region. The temples were rectangular, often with a smaller annex room, and were built along an east-west axis. The adyton (most sacred space) was located in the western part of the temple. One notable feature of these temples was the ""bent-entry"", where the main entrance was not centrally located. These temples were typically smaller in size compared to other cultic architecture in the southern Levant, a geographical region corresponding approximately to modern-day Israel, Palestine, and Jordan. The architecture and the humble proportions of such temples indicate that they were not meant for public use but rather for the clergy. Many of these elements were preserved in temple design during the late Persian period. Archaeological evidence indicates that the sanctuary was built in multiple phases. A temple was initially built between the Iron Age II and Persian period, but remains have not survived intact, indicating that it was likely constructed using perishable materials. In the initial phase, the sacred area housed at least one cultic statue, supported by the discovery of a fragment from a small-sized statue dating to the first half of the 6th century BC, found 20m (66ft) northwest of the sanctuary favissa. This statue resembles several examples of Cypriot cultic statues discovered among the materials of the favissa of the Phoenician temple in Amrit, but it remains uncertain whether the Kharayeb statue was imported from Cyprus or locally produced. The feet of another statue of a different iconographic type were found by Kaoukabani. Cultic artefacts dating from the Iron Age II or Persian period were also discovered, these included figurines, small and miniature vases and pottery, and miniature altars. In a later phase, at the beginning of the Hellenistic period, the structures from the Iron Age II were replaced by a larger, completely new building. The surviving Hellenistic period temple's main chamber measures approximately 13m ×11m (43ft ×36ft). Significant foundation work was done to level the flooring due to the sloping rocky terrain, and walls were built directly on the bedrock. The sanctuary then consisted of a large paved courtyard leading to the southwest-facing temple façade. The temple consisted of a large square hall giving access to a smaller rectangular room in the west-northwest side. The walls of the sanctuary were constructed using stones of different sizes and large blocks to provide stability, employing a typical header-and-stretcher bond ashlar construction technique commonly seen in the Persian and Hellenistic period buildings in Phoenicia. Both interior and exterior walls were covered with lime plaster, and the interior plaster was polished. The temple exterior was adorned with architectural design elements commonly found in sacred buildings in the Tyre region, including a cavetto cornice and a lintel decorated with a sun disk flanked by uraei. The design of the building and its decorations resembled the sanctuary of Umm al-Amad. The temple's main entrance on the southwest-facing façade was flanked by two male figure statues wearing an Egyptian-style loin cloth, the shendyt. Each statue has one advanced foot (one on the right, the other on the left), and the better-preserved of the two figures shows traces of an animal held under the left arm. Such sculptures are typical of Phoenicia and Cyprus. In Phoenicia, examples of this type were found in Sarepta, Amrit, Byblos, Sidon, Tyre, and Umm al-Amad. Scholars believe that these Egypt-inspired sculptural groups served as protective figures, and were stationed at the entrance of Phoenician temples. At a later stage during the Hellenistic period, the floor of the large square hall was paved with flat stone slabs. A group of multicolored mosaic tesserae was excavated, suggesting the presence of a simple geometric pattern mosaic in the center of the hall. The interior walls were embellished with stucco decoration, similar to the ornate houses of the coastal cities of the Levant during that period, featuring oval-shaped motifs some examples of which have been found on site by Kaoukabani. The interior decoration of the building, which included the scattered gem-like glass pastes collected by the locals to make jewelry, were also dated to the Hellenisitc period. In addition to the architectural, decorative, and cultic items, excavations have yielded a wealth of artifacts, including thousands of terracotta figurines, and miniature vessels that provide insight into the religious practices of the native population. Terracotta figurines from the Iron Age II or Persian period were found on site. They were made locally by artisans who produced images of a well-documented type found in Phoenicia (Sarepta, Tyre, Tell Keisan, Achziv, Dor), and Cyprus. The repertoire of votive figurines includes pregnant women, women with their hands placed on their breasts, seated male figurines wearing an atef crown or with a flat hairstyle, horse riders, tambourine players, and the god Bes, an ancient Egyptian deity worshipped as a protector of households, mothers, children, and childbirth. In the Hellenistic period, a heavy influx of worshipers prompted local terracotta figurine makers to adopt the more efficient and cost-effective double molds technique. The new technique was introduced from prominent Hellenistic figurines production centers like Alexandria in Egypt. Original molds were acquired and modified to reflect local styles and context, and figurines were locally produced in Tyre as evidenced by clay ion-beam analysis, and the presence of incised Phoenician letters on the figurines before firing. The acquisition of molds with Greek iconography introduced the images of Hellenistic deities such as Aphrodite, Artemis, Demeter, Dionysus, Eros, Heracles, and Hermes into the hinterland of Tyre. The number of figurines depicting deities is scarce compared to the total cataloged pieces, with the majority of the figurines depicting human subjects, and, most notably, children engaged in playful activities. The imagery portrays the rural and pastoral environment in which the users of these figurines lived. There were numerous figurines of schoolchildren and theater masks suggesting a diverse range of worshipers, including those from urban centers. The inclusion of these motifs reflects the cultural and educational aspects of Hellenistic city life, indicating that the sanctuary attracted devotees not only from rural areas but also from coastal cities where such themes were more prevalent in daily life. The influence of Alexandria is also apparent through a number of figurines depicting a breastfeeding Isis, Horus, and Harpocrates. Miniature cultic pottery vessels were found in various places in the sanctuary, and were utilized in rituals throughout the sanctuary's periods of use. Small plates and bowls were found by the Italian mission under the temple's paving, in the Iron Age II and Persian period phase layers. Pottery from the Hellenistic phase include small and miniature unguentaria, miniature plates, and small jugs. Chéhab uncovered the remains of lamb and an ankle bone used for divination within one of the unearthed small plates. A number of miniature altars, dating to the Iron Age II and Persian period, and similar to ones found in Amrit, Sidon, and Tell el-Burak were also found on site. The site yielded a few inscriptions: on votive figurines, and on a fragment of a limestone statue found by Chéhab at the bottom of the sanctuary favissa. The fragment consists of a statue base with both feet depicted in profile, with a Phoenician inscription carved between the legs. Chéhab translated the inscription in his 1952 excavation report as ""Because he heard the word of his servants"". In 1955, he revised his interpretation, presenting a slightly different translation: ""...of them, because he heard their words (prayers), may he bless them"". The inscription was dated to the 4th century BC, based on comparisons with the inscription of the Batnoam sarcophagus (KAI 11) and the Phoenician graffiti from Abydos (KAI 49). Scholars have not identified the deity worshiped at the sanctuary as no specific god names are mentioned in the site inscriptions. Chéhab proposed that the sanctuary was a center for agrarian and initiatory cults, based on the figurines representing Demeter and Kore, the Greek goddesses of harvest and spring respectively. On the other hand, Kaoukabani suggested that the sanctuary was initially dedicated to Astarte. According to his interpretation, the building was a mammisi, a chapel-like building that serves as a place for rituals and ceremonies associated with the divine birth or infancy of a deity. He further proposed that the cult likely acquired characteristics related to Demeter and included mystical elements. The study of the terracotta figurines contributed to the understanding of the religious cult. A revised understanding was put forth by Italian historian Maria Grazia Lancellotti who characterizes the sanctuary as a smaller religious site that, like the temple of Eshmun in Bustan el-Sheikh at the outskirts of Sidon, centered around the veneration of deities of healing and salvation, with an emphasis on rituals associated with childbearing and childhood. This interpretation would explain the discovery of numerous child figurines on-site. According to Oggiano, the religious practices observed at the Kharayeb sanctuary were part of the same cultic system that included the sanctuaries of Umm al-Amad, the temple of Sarepta, and possibly Tyre. These shared practices include the performance of comparable rituals, the dedication of stone and terracotta statues, and the use of a similar syntax of dedicatory inscriptions across the entire region of the Tyre hinterland. The Eastern Temple in Umm al-Amad yielded twelve terracotta figurines, with the majority retrieved from the ""Throne Chapel"". Notably, these figurines belong to the well-documented type associated with the Kharayeb sanctuary. In addition to the dedication of figurines, the rituals practiced at the Kharayeb sanctuary included pouring oils from unguentaria, and offering libations poured from miniature and medium-sized jugs. The great number of clay figurines discovered at the sanctuary is evidence of the intensive religious activity in the Phoenician sanctuary between the fourth and first centuries BC. The temple's small interior was periodically cleared of votive offerings to make space for new statuettes. As a result, around 8,000 terracotta figurines were collected and stored in a specially dug favissa. The Kharayeb figurines portrayed various aspects of local Phoenician society over many centuries, consistently emphasizing the significance of motherhood and childhood for the people frequenting the sanctuary. During the Persian period, a great number of figurines represented pregnant women, and in the Hellenistic period, numerous depictions of children engaged in playful activities with animals or music instruments were found. The small size of the cultic objects further indicates the potential involvement of children in the rituals.",Normal
"Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd. v West Bromwich Building Society  UKHL 28 is a frequently-cited English contract law case which laid down that a contextual approach must be taken to the interpretation of contracts. Lord Hoffmann set out five principles, so that contract should be construed according to: Investors received negligent advice from their financial advisers, solicitors and building societies, including West Bromwich Building Society ('West Bromwich BS'). They had claims in tort and for breach of statutory duty. The investors had been encouraged by financiers to enter ""Home Income Plans"", which meant mortgaging their properties to get cash that they would put into equity linked bonds. They lost money when house prices and stocks fell. Under the Financial Services Act 1986 section 54 the Securities and Investments Board started the Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd, where investors could be directly compensated for their losses, and ICS would try recoup the cost by suing the building societies on everyone’s behalf. Accordingly, to get the compensation investors signed a contract to assign their claims to ICS. But in section 3(b) of the claim form the assignment excluded ‘Any claim (whether sounding in rescission for undue influence or otherwise) that you have or may have against the West Bromwich Building Society’, so that investors could still sue on some claims individually. While ICS Ltd was suing, West Bromwich BS argued that ‘or otherwise’ meant that claims for damages, as well as rescission, had not been assigned. ICS Ltd argued that the clause actually meant that claims for damages had been assigned, because ‘or otherwise’ referred to rescission based claims other than undue influence, but not damages. Evan-Lombes J held that the right to claim rescission had been retained but the right to claim damages had been assigned. Leggatt LJ overturned the High Court, and ICS Ltd appealed. The House of Lords held by a majority that the right to claim rescission was retained by the investors, but the right to claim for damages had indeed been assigned. Construed in its context, the words ‘Any claim (whether sounding in rescission for undue influence or otherwise) that you have or may have against the West Bromwich Building Society’ in effect had meant 'Any claim sounding in rescission (whether for undue influence or otherwise)'. It followed that ICS Ltd could sue West Bromwich BS, and other building societies, to vindicate the investors' claims. Lord Lloyd dissented. Lord Hoffmann stated the following. In the Court of Appeal, Leggatt L.J. said that the judge's interpretation was ""not an available meaning of the words."" ""Any claim (whether sounding in rescission for undue influence or otherwise)"" could not mean ""Any claim sounding in rescission (whether for undue influence or otherwise)"" and that was that. He was unimpressed by the alleged commercial nonsense of the alternative construction. My Lords, I will say at once that I prefer the approach of the learned judge. But I think I should preface my explanation of my reasons with some general remarks about the principles by which contractual documents are nowadays construed. I do not think that the fundamental change which has overtaken this branch of the law, particularly as a result of the speeches of Lord Wilberforce in Prenn v Simmonds  1 WLR 1381, 1384-1386 and Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Yngvar Hansen-Tangen  1 WLR 989, is always sufficiently appreciated. The result has been, subject to one important exception, to assimilate the way in which such documents are interpreted by judges to the common sense principles by which any serious utterance would be interpreted in ordinary life. Almost all the old intellectual baggage of ""legal"" interpretation has been discarded. The principles may be summarised as follows: (1) Interpretation is the ascertainment of the meaning which the document would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract. (2) The background was famously referred to by Lord Wilberforce as the ""matrix of fact,"" but this phrase is, if anything, an understated description of what the background may include. Subject to the requirement that it should have been reasonably available to the parties and to the exception to be mentioned next, it includes absolutely anything which would have affected the way in which the language of the document would have been understood by a reasonable man. (3) The law excludes from the admissible background the previous negotiations of the parties and their declarations of subjective intent. They are admissible only in an action for rectification. The law makes this distinction for reasons of practical policy and, in this respect only, legal interpretation differs from the way we would interpret utterances in ordinary life. The boundaries of this exception are in some respects unclear. But this is not the occasion on which to explore them. (4) The meaning which a document (or any other utterance) would convey to a reasonable man is not the same thing as the meaning of its words. The meaning of words is a matter of dictionaries and grammars; the meaning of the document is what the parties using those words against the relevant background would reasonably have been understood to mean. The background may not merely enable the reasonable man to choose between the possible meanings of words which are ambiguous but even (as occasionally happens in ordinary life) to conclude that the parties must, for whatever reason, have used the wrong words or syntax. (see Mannai Investments Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd  2 WLR 945 (5) The ""rule"" that words should be given their ""natural and ordinary meaning"" reflects the common sense proposition that we do not easily accept that people have made linguistic mistakes, particularly in formal documents. On the other hand, if one would nevertheless conclude from the background that something must have gone wrong with the language, the law does not require judges to attribute to the parties an intention which they plainly could not have had. Lord Diplock made this point more vigorously when he said in The Antaios Compania Neviera SA v Salen Rederierna AB  1 AC 191, 201: ""... if detailed semantic and syntactical analysis of words in a commercial contract is going to lead to a conclusion that flouts business commonsense, it must be made to yield to business commonsense."" If one applies these principles, it seems to me that the judge must be right and, as we are dealing with one badly drafted clause which is happily no longer in use, there is little advantage in my repeating his reasons at greater length. The only remark of his which I would respectfully question is when he said that he was ""doing violence"" to the natural meaning of the words. This is an over-energetic way to describe the process of interpretation. Many people, including politicians, celebrities and Mrs. Malaprop, mangle meanings and syntax but nevertheless communicate tolerably clearly what they are using the words to mean. If anyone is doing violence to natural meanings, it is they rather than their listeners.  Finally, on this part of the case, I must make some comments upon the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Leggatt L.J. said that his construction was ""the natural and ordinary meaning of the words used."" I do not think that the concept of natural and ordinary meaning is very helpful when, on any view, the words have not been used in a natural and ordinary way. In a case like this, the court is inevitably engaged in choosing between competing unnatural meanings. Secondly, Leggatt L.J. said that the judge's construction was not an ""available meaning"" of the words. If this means that judges cannot, short of rectification, decide that the parties must have made mistakes of meaning or syntax, I respectfully think he was wrong. The proposition is not, I would suggest, borne out by his citation from Alice Through the Looking Glass. Alice and Humpty Dumpty were agreed that the word ""glory"" did not mean ""a nice knock-down argument."" Anyone with a dictionary could see that. Humpty Dumpty's point was that ""a nice knock-down argument"" was what he meant by using the word ""glory."" He very fairly acknowledged that Alice, as a reasonable young woman, could not have realised this until he told her, but once he had told her, or if, without being expressly told, she could have inferred it from the background, she would have had no difficulty in understanding what he meant. Lord Goff, Lord Hope and Lord Clyde concurred.",Normal
"John Noel Dowland, GC (6 November 1914 – 13 January 1942) was a Royal Air Force officer of the Second World War and a recipient of the George Cross. Dowland was the son of the vicar of Ruscombe, the Rev. F.M. Dowland, and educated at St John's School, Leatherhead before taking him flight training at Cranwell in 1934. After Cranwell he was a gazette as a pilot officer and joined a squadron of Bomber Command. At the outbreak of World War II he took command of a unit overseas. Dowland was a Royal Air Force officer of the Second World War and a recipient of the George Cross. Along with civilian armament instructor Leonard Henry Harrison, Dowland was awarded the George Cross for his gallantry in defusing a bomb that had fallen on the grain ship SS Kildare in Immingham docks on 11 February 1940. The bomb proved extremely difficult to defuse as it had embedded itself at an extreme angle in the main deck. The citation, which appeared in the London Gazette on 7 January 1941, noted that he displayed the same ""conspicuous courage and devotion to duty in circumstances of exceptional danger and difficulty"" when defusing a bomb on a trawler in June 1940. His and Harrison's actions were the earliest to be awarded the George Cross, although Thomas Alderson's award was the first to be announced. Dowland later achieved the rank of wing commander, but was killed when taking part in a raid on Pantelleria on 13 January 1942. After the aircraft he was piloting was damaged by anti-aircraft fire, Dowland attempted an emergency landing at Luqa, Malta. Both he and his observer were killed in the subsequent crash. Dowland is buried in Capuccini Naval Cemetery, Malta.",Normal

"Zakamensk (Russian: Зака́менск; Buryat: Захаамин, Zahaamin; before 1959 – Gorodok) is a city of a regional significance in Russia, administration center of Zakamensky District of the Republic of Buryatia. Since 2015 the city has an honorary international title ""The city of Labor Valor and Glory"" The history of the city has close ties with the history and development of deposits of tungsten and molybdenum in the Dzhida ore node and the production of tungsten and molybdenum concentrate at the Dzhidinsky mining and processing plant. In 1929, the doctor of geological and mineralogical sciences A.V. Arsen'ev made a justification about the presence of a tungsten deposit in the Zakamensk district of the Buryat-Mongolian ASSR. On July 9, 1932, a geological party led by M.V Besova uncovered the first quartz vein with large wolframite crystals in the Gurjirka fall, discovering the Dzhida tungsten deposit. On the 2nd of March, 1933, the working village of Gorodok has been established. On 11th of October1934, People's Commissar of heavy industry of the USSR Sergo Ordzhonikidze signed an order on the opening of Dzhidastroy, the construction of the Dzhidinsky tungsten-molybdenum combine was initiated. Initially, the work village was located at the site of the village Modonkul, located at the confluence of the Modonkul River and Dhzida. In 1935, a place was chosen for the foundation of the working settlement of Dzhidastroy – between the village of Modonkul and the Incur mine, in an extensive cherry grove. Already in the autumn, a road was laid, houses, a dining room, a shop and a bathhouse were built. During the following year, barrack-type houses were built for workers. In the same year, a bridge across Dzhida river was built, heavy machinery and equipment began to be imported, and the Holston mine was launched. Molybdenum mineralization has been launched at the Pervomaisky site. The share of the local tungsten is accounted for 65% of production throughout the country. In 1938, the village of Dzhidastroy officially received the status of an urban-type settlement. In 1939, the mining and the processing plant and the Holston mine were put into operation. In 1941, a narrow-gauge railway was built, the Pervomaisky molybdenum mine was created. Already the following year, the molybdenum processing pant began operation. The mining and processing pant was finally formed. The War began, the Tyrnyauz mining and processing plant was occupied, as the result of which the local plant becomes the main supplier of tungsten in the country. Since February 13, 1941, the further construction of the Dzhidacombinat has been transferred to the jurisdiction of the NKVD of the USSR. Dzhidinlag is being organized, the labor force began to be replenished by prisoners. Since March 1943, deported Germans, who has been resettled earlier, mostly women, have been mobilized for correctional labor work in Dzhidastroy. They were busy with mining and washing of the concentrate and logging. In 1944, the village of Dzhidastroy received the status of a city and a new name ""Gorodok"". There was a theater, kindergartens, and the service industry developed. The Dzhidacombinat itself was transferred to the People's commissar of non-ferrous metallurgy of the USSR in 1945. At the same time, a large group of Japanese prisoners of war arrived there. A large number of freelance workers worked at the combine, but the number of prisoners involved in work was still greater. In 1953, Dzhidlag was liquidated, which caused a sharp reduction on the number of employees of the plant. Recruitment of the specialists in other regions was required to replenish the staff, which took a long time. In 1959, the city was renamed Zakamensk. During the 1950s, street lighting appeared, well-maintained 3-4-storey houses were built, a mining college and a consumer service plant were opened. On April 2, 1963, Zakamensk was transformed into a city of republican subordination. Bayangol, Inkur and Holtoson villages are subordinated to the City Council. On January 13, 1965, the city of Zakamensk and the village of Inkur were transferred from republican subordination to the Zakamensky district. The city of Zakamensk became the district center. In 1967, the Palace of Culture with a hall with 600 seats was built and put into operation. In 1973, the Pervomaisky mine was closed due to the full development of the deposit. In 1974, a new bridge over the Dzhida River and the terminal building were built. In 1983, the Gornyak cinema with 400 seats appeared. In 1989, the plant was recognized as the winner in the All-Union Socialist Competition with entry on the All-Union Honor Board of the VDNH of the USSR. In 1990, the school No. 5 was built for 1,500 students. On October 27, 1992, the plant was transformed into the JSC ""Dzhidinsky Combine"". Due to the conversion of the military industry, the volume of production is reduced by 70%. In 1995, the production of tungsten in comparison to 1989 decreased 4 times. The State Reserve Committee sells 13,500 tons of tungsten at dumping prices, next year Kazakhstan also sells 10,000 tons of tungsten. Prices on the world market decreased by a third, sales decreased 2.2 times. As a result, the costs of production is 1.5 times higher than the cost price . Thus, the rash actions of the government in the absence of state support put the company in a hopeless situation. On February 26, 1998, the Dzhida tungsten-molybdenum Combine ceased to exist. In 2006, Zakamensk LLC began work on the extraction of placer tungsten at the Inkurskoye field. Later, having received licenses for the development of tailings dumps, it ordered the development of a technology for extracting metal from stale sands. In 2008, an enterprise for the processing of waste from the work of the Dzhidinsky VMK, which extracts tungsten with associated gold and silver, was put into operation. Later, in 2010, the company ""Tverdosplav"" won a tender for the use of mineral resources in the area of the Holtoson and Inkur deposits, planning to build a new mining and processing plant in the coming years. In May 2014, the universal sports complex ""Tamir"" was opened. On May 5, 2015, the city of Zakamensk received the title ""City of Labor Valor and Glory"". On May 7 of the same year, in a solemn atmosphere in Victory Square, a T-62K tank ""General Tank"" was installed on a pedestal in honor of the veterans of the workers of the rear of the Dzhida tungsten-molybdenum Combine. The city is located in the south-west of Buryatia near the state border with Mongolia, 404km from Ulan-Ude, in the central part of the Dzhida ridge. It is located in the mountainous taiga area of the Modon-Kul River valley— the right tributary of the Dzhida River. The height of the bottom of the mountain valley is about 1100 m above sea level, medium-high mountains with absolute marks of 1300–1400 m are adjacent to the city. The city is located in the mountainous taiga zone, remote from other industrial centers, in the valley of a small watercourse originating in Mongolia. Nevertheless, the ecological situation in most of the city and its surroundings is extremely unfavorable. From an ecological point of view, the territory of Zakamensk and the former Dzhida tungsten-molybdenum Combine is the most disadvantaged part of the Baikal natural territory. The Dzhidinsky combine is a pollutant of all components of the natural environment. The ores that were developed by the tungsten-molybdenum combine contain chemical elements belonging to various hazard classes: cadmium, lead, zinc, fluorine; molybdenum, calcium; beryllium, tungsten, bismuth, rubidium, caesium; rocks with high sulfide contents were developed to Class I; to class II; beryllium, tungsten, bismuth, caesium; in addition, rocks with high sulfide contents were developed. When enriching tungsten-molybdenum ore by flotation, toxic reagents were used — kerosene, sulfuric acid, xanthogenate, pine oil, liquid glass, etc., which also accumulated in tailings. In total, 44.5 million tons of waste were generated during the operation of the Dzhida tungsten-molybdenum Combine. Partially man-made waste was used for filling roads, city sites, building houses. In the process of wind dispersal, transfer and erosion by surface and groundwater, soils, vegetation, air, underground and surface waters were contaminated with toxic compounds. The main sources of pollution are man-made sands of tailings of waste from the processing plants of the closed Dzhidacombinat, and mine, tunnel, quarry, sub-basement waters of the streams Gujirka, Inkur and the ""Zapadnaya"" tunnels, containing water-soluble forms of ore elements, and polluting through surface and underground runoff of the soil in the city and the waters of the Modonkul and Myrgensheno rivers. Mine waters and tailings are characterized by the greatest pollution. In mine waters, the excess of MPC of some elements (Cd, Pb, Zn, F, Cu, W, Mn, etc.) from hazard class I—III near pollution sources reaches tens and hundreds of times, in the tailings, the content of heavy metals reaches 100 or more MPC, according to the indicators of total geochemical pollution, the condition of the soils of the suburbs and the city itself is assessed as dangerous, in some places as extremely dangerous. The area of the ecologically unfavorable territory is 867 hectares, including 487 hectares in Zakamensk (68.53% of the city's territory), 380 hectares - mining workings and overburden dumps. On the territory of the city itself, according to the total indicator of chemical element pollution (Cu, Zn, As, Pb, Mo, W, Cd, Sb), there are: - an ecological disaster zone with an area of 281.3 hectares (39% of the city's territory) — an environmental emergency zone with an area of 205.8 hectares (29% of the city's territory) The situation is aggravated by the extremely unfortunate location of the first tailings dump, closed in 1958 — on a hill, on the outskirts of the city. As a result, during rains, heavy metals migrate with stormwater and groundwater through densely populated areas of the city, infecting the right bank of the city with streams of dispersion of water-soluble metal compounds. Also, with strong winds, dust storms are not uncommon, which have formed a tail of scattering of man-made sands along the foot of the mountain with a length of 15km. As a result, the Modonkul River is one of the most polluted water bodies in the Baikal region. The working version of the project ""Elimination of the negative impacts of technogenic tailings of the Dzhidinsky tungsten-molybdenum Combine in the Zakamensky district of the Republic of Buryatia"" (the first stage) was developed back in 2007 by order of the State Committee for Nature of the Republic. In 2010, the issue of liquidation of the tailings dump was submitted by the authorities of the republic as a proposal to the Federal Target Program ""Protection of Lake Baikal and socio-economic development of the Baikal Natural Territory"". The federal authorities have planned to allocate 4 billion rubles for project activities until 2020. This project will be a pilot for the federal target program for the elimination of accumulated environmental damage. Within the framework of the republican program ""Environmental safety in the Republic of Buryatia for 2009-2011 and for the period up to 2017"", with the involvement of federal and regional funding sources, the implementation of the first stage of the project ""Elimination of environmental consequences of the activities of the Dzhida Tungsten-Molybdenum Combine"" was launched. The tender for the execution of works on this project was won by CJSC Zakamensk, during its execution, the rocks of the Dzhida tailings dump with a volume of 3.2 million tons covering an area of 452 hectares were moved to the dump in the Barun-Naryn Padi for the purpose of their further processing at the processing plant of CJSC Zakamensk"". The contractor under the state contract for the ""second stage of measures to eliminate the environmental consequences of the activities of the Dzhidinsky tungsten-molybdenum Combine in the Zakamensky district of the Republic of Buryatia"" in 2011 became LLC Gidrospetsstroy. The project of the second stage of work did not include a program for medical and social rehabilitation of the population, which led to a heated public discussion. As a result, the government of Buryatia promised to allocate funds for medical research to assess the health status of the population of Zakamensk. This work will be coordinated by the Buryat branch of the FBGU SB RAMS ""Scientific Center for Health, Family and Human Reproduction"". In the course of the second stage of work, the removal of man-made waste from the Dzhida tailings dump will continue, the construction of several complexes of treatment facilities near the city and mines for the treatment of stormwater, mine and basement waters, anti-erosion measures, demolition of abandoned buildings and structures of the combine, biological reclamation on an area of 613.8 hectares, including in the city, systematic monitoring of the environmental situation will be conducted. In 2016, the first results of complex medical, sociological and biogeochemical studies conducted by scientific specialists of the Federal Scientific Center for Medical and Preventive Technologies for Public Health Risk Management of Rospotrebnadzor were published. In the course of scientific research, a hygienic assessment of the quality of environmental objects (atmospheric air, soil, drinking water, food products) was carried out, the health status of children and adults in the city of Zakamensk and the village of Mikhailovka was assessed, statistical data and scientific publications were analyzed. Studies of drinking water sources revealed excess of Fe, Ni, Cd and Pb standards in samples from wells. The water in the centralized water supply system meets the hygienic requirements, in private wells the excess of the maximum permissible concentration of Fe was recorded. The soils, according to their data, are intensively polluted, but no anomalies were detected when analyzing samples of local fruit and vegetable, dairy and meat products. Monitoring of atmospheric air dustiness revealed irregular dusting of the air environment, heavy metal contents not exceeding the maximum permissible concentrations were recorded in part of the samples. It is stated that there are risks of developing oncological diseases in the local population. As a result, scientists have confirmed the existence of environmental problems, but do not characterize the current situation as an environmental disaster or ecological catastrophe. Within the framework of administrative divisions, Zakamensk serves as the administrative center of Zakamensky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Zakamensky District as the Town of Zakamensk. As a municipal division, the Town of Zakamensk and Kholtosonsky Selsoviet are incorporated within Zakamensky Municipal District as Zakamensk Urban Settlement. Kholtosonsky Selsoviet used to be municipally incorporated as Kholtosonskoye Rural Settlement, but the latter was merged into Zakamensk Urban Settlement on July18, 2015. The town's economy relies mainly on the mining and processing of metal ores, which are then mainly transported to smelters in the Ural Mountains. There is road from Zakamensk to Dzhida railway station, 253 kilometers (157mi) to the east on the Trans-Mongolian Railway.",Normal

"University of Latvia Nidaa Khoury (Arabic: نداء خوري; Hebrew: נידאא ח'ורי) is a lecturer at Ben-Gurion University in the Department of Hebrew literature. She is also the first Arab-Israeli poet to be included within the literature Bagrut curriculum in Israel. Nidaa Khoury was born in Fassuta, Upper Galilee, to a family originating in Aleppo, the third-born of four siblings. Her father worked in the textile industry. When she was 14, Khoury was sent to Saint Joseph Internal School for Girls in Nazareth. She married at age 17, when she had to leave school, and had four children. ""Nidaa"" is a pen name meaning ""a voice calls"". Khoury worked at Mercantile Discount Bank for nine years, after which she embarked on her academic path, wherein she studied advertising and public relations at Haifa University (1994). She studied fine arts administration and got certified as a community center director, also at Haifa University (1996). She earned a Bachelor's degree in philosophy and comparative literature from Haifa University (1995–98), and a Master's in education and behavioral studies from Latvia University (2000). She studied industrial entrepreneurship and management at Tel Aviv University (2003). She completed a course in company directorship at Ben-Gurion University (2007). Khoury has published 13 books of poetry, and her works have been translated into many languages. Her 2011 collection Book of Sins (House of Nehesi Publishers), was translated into English by Betsy Rosenberg and nominated for the Warwick Prize. Her 2011 collection, Olive Oil and Pomegranate Crop, was published in Italian as Le stagioni dell’olio e Del melograno by Il Laboratorio le edizioni in Naples. Another Body (2011), published by Keshev leShirá, is a selection of Khoury's poems written from 1987 to 2010, some written in Hebrew, and others translated from Arabic by Prof. Sasson Somekh, Dr. Hanna Amit Cochavi, and Prof. Na’im Aryadi. Her book Barefoot River was translated into Hebrew by Rozha Tabor and published by Eshkolót Publishers in 1990. Khoury's first book, I’ll Declare to You My Silence, was published in 1987 and attracted the attention of literature researchers, who cited her poetry's uniqueness and complexity. Since then, Khoury has published eight more books, among them Rings of Salt, published in Lebanon in 1998 by al-Muassa al-Arabiya, Beirut. Another book, The Most Beautiful Goddess is crying, was published in Egypt in 2000 by Markaz al-Khadara, Cairo. Khoury's books published in Akko, Nazareth, and Jerusalem have won positive reviews, particularly The Wind Belt, published by Abu-Rachmon in Akko in 1990. A departure in Khoury's writing is embodied by Book of the Flaw, which was rejected by publishers in the Arab world due to its character and content. It was ultimately published by Kolbo Sfarìm in Haifa in 2011. Book of the Flaw is a modernist book of poetry that addresses Christian theology and challenges the sacrament of Holy Communion as a central Catholic ritual. It demonstrates the breakdown of the source of authority, and undergoes a series of parallel contradictions in the process of attaining redemption. In 2005, Khoury began teaching in the Hebrew Literature Department of Ben-Gurion University. In 2009, she was appointed Senior Lecturer in the department and in the General Studies Department's conflict resolution program. Since 2014, she has served as head of the admissions committee for the conflict resolution program. In 2013, Khoury was appointed Full Professor. She also taught in the Department of Middle East Studies at Ben-Gurion. Since 2011, she has been on the board of directors of the Eliashar Center for the Study of Sephardic Jewry at Ben-Gurion. Hannah Amit-Cochavi and Ariel Sheetrit, from the Israeli Writers Concordance, on Khoury: “Her poetry style is sensuous and modernist and her poems stand out in their musicality. Khoury frequently uses first person singular, thus examining the complexities of personal point of view. In addition, she frequently addresses the reader in second person singular, often with vehement defiance. Her poetry exposes her inner world… In contrast, most of her poems focus on oppression of women by men via religion…her writing combines motifs from Christian Scripture and church ritual, which she uses to evoke the intimate ambience that these rituals produce, as well as sharp criticism of the religious establishment…her poetry also contains an element of Ars- Poetical that stems from her awareness of and sensitivity to the power of words and the force of poetry.” Amit Goldenberg of Beit Avi Hai said of Khoury: “The poet Nidaa Khoury is one of the clearest and most interesting voices in her perspective on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Khoury, a champion of the Palestinian struggle, has walked a long path in recent years, and today looks at reality from a fascinating height in all its complexity, seeking to erase boundaries of state and land, and to focus on the individual.” She is also an active participant in human rights and has participated in over 30 international human rights conferences and literary festivals. These include: The Conference of Arab Poets in Amsterdam; The Conference of Human Rights and Solidarity with the Third World in Paris; The Poetry Festival of Jordan; The International Poetry Festival of Medellin; The St. Martin Book Fair; The Napoli Conference on Human Rights. She also works for The Forty Association, an organization that works towards securing human rights of the unrecognized Arab villages in Israel.

"Desmond John Schonegevel (9 October 1934 – 6 July 2021) was a South African cricketer who played 100 matches of first-class cricket in South Africa between 1954 and 1977. A solid middle-order batsman and off-spin bowler, Des Schonegevel made his first-class debut for Orange Free State in the 1954–55 season and played regularly for Orange Free State until the end of the 1964–65 season. His highest score for Orange Free State was 151 against Border in 1963–64, made in a little over six hours, and his best figures were 6 for 103 against Griqualand West in 1958–59. He captained Orange Free State from 1962–63 to 1964–65. Against Transvaal B in 1959–60 he scored 115, adding 280 for the third wicket with his captain, Clive Richardson, and setting a Currie Cup third-wicket record. He moved to Kimberley in 1965 and played for Griqualand West from 1965–66 until 1975–76, captaining them in 1968–69. In his third match for Griqualand West he top-scored in each innings with 79 not out and 138 not out against Natal B; in the second innings he and the number 11 batsman put on an unbroken partnership of 87 to avoid defeat. In 1966–67 his 112 against Orange Free State helped Griqualand West achieve their first victory since 1959–60. Against the Australians in 1969–70 he top-scored in each innings, scoring 49 and 85, defying the Australian spin bowlers ""with dour concentration"", but this time Griqualand West lost by an innings. His highest score for Griqualand West was 138 not out against Natal B, as above, and his best bowling figures were 6 for 29 against Border in 1967–68. After he retired from playing, Schonegevel became a prominent coach and administrator in Griqualand WestNorthern Cape.

"Minnesota Centennial Showboat was a traditional riverboat theatre docked at Harriet Island Regional Park on the banks of the Mississippi River in downtown Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States. The showboat contained an intimate jewelbox theatre that seated 225. The interior was decorated to keep in time with the Victorian Era style commonly associated with showboats. The Minnesota Centennial Showboat was run through a partnership with the University of Minnesota Theatre Department and the Padelford Boat Company. The showboat was a longtime tradition with the University beginning in 1958. The University Theatre utilized the showboat as a learning opportunity for its students to experience professional theatre. The showboat had its final performance in 2016. In 1956, the Minnesota Centennial Commission began to plan for the 1958 state centennial celebration. Frank Whiting, director of the University of Minnesota's theater program, saw an opportunity to realize his dream of a showboat theater on the Mississippi River. He proposed a Minnesota Centennial Showboat. The commission agreed, and the search began for a suitable boat. Finding a paddleboat wasn't easy, and building one on an existing barge proved too costly. In 1957, Whiting and the Centennial Commission's Tom Swain learned that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers planned to retire the General John Newton, a 175-foot (53m) sternwheeler towboat built in 1899. Minnesota Senator Edward J. Thye helped to arrange its transfer to the university for the symbolic fee of one dollar. The paddleboat arrived in Saint Paul on April 3, 1958. The university had less than three months to prepare it for the season opening on June 26. Students helped to recreate the atmosphere of an 1890s showboat by painting walls, sewing curtains, reupholstering old theater seats, building scenery, and sewing costumes. The first season opened with a production of Augustin Daly's 1867 melodrama Under the Gaslight. Miss Minnesota Diane Albers, assisted by Doc Whiting and Centennial Commission Chairman Peter Popovich, christened the boat by breaking a bottle of champagne across the bow. James S. Lombard of the commission's arts committee cut the ribbon to open the gangplank. Mayor Joseph E. Dillon of Saint Paul rang the ship's original bell to invite the theater's first patrons aboard. In its early years, the showboat traveled up and down the river. It stopped for scheduled performances in Minneapolis, Saint Paul, Stillwater, Hastings, Red Wing, Wabasha, and Winona. The student cast, numbering about fifteen, performed one or two plays each season. Each show featured vaudeville-style olios (lively song-and-dance numbers) between acts. In addition to performing, the actors cleaned the boat, greeted visitors, and took tickets, among other tasks. 1969 marked the last season the boat toured. Following that season, it made an appearance in the Swedish film The Emigrants before settling into a stationary mooring site on the river's east bank, below Coffman Memorial Union. In 1995, the ninety-six-year-old paddleboat moved to Saint Paul for $2 million in needed repairs. However sparks from a welder ignited a fire that destroyed the boat on the evening of January 27, 2000, just months before its scheduled reopening. Only the paddlewheel and burned-out hull remained. University theater professor C. Lance Brockman led a campaign to obtain a new showboat. In December 2000, the university agreed to a partnership with the City of Saint Paul, the Saint Paul Riverfront Development Corporation, and the Padelford Packet Boat Company to build a new showboat. Construction began the following spring in Greenville, Mississippi. Christened the Frank M. Whiting, the new Minnesota Centennial Showboat arrived at Harriet Island on April 17, 2002. It opened on July 4 with a production of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The Minnesota Centennial Showboat exposed students to a unique type of theater. Student actors embraced the over-the-top style of melodrama. Designers and student crews met the challenges presented by a small performance space. Audiences joined the fun by booing and hissing at the villain and applauding the hero. The showboat program earned the Tourism Partner of the Year Award from the Saint Paul Convention and Visitors Bureau in 2004. The Padelford Packet Boat Company joined the university's Department of Theatre Arts & Dance to create the C. Lance Brockman Showboat Scholarship later that year. The final curtain came down on the Minnesota Centennial Showboat at the end of the 2016 summer season. The university's fifteen-year agreement with the City of Saint Paul expired, and the university cut the program for budget reasons. The final season featured a revival of Under the Gaslight. The university sold the boat to the City of Saint Paul for one dollar. As of 2018, future plans for the showboat are pending a new management agreement. In 2018, a nonprofit raised money to buy the boat and move it to Winona, Minnesota. The Showboat Players were a troupe of performers that were cast exclusively from students at the University of Minnesota. They performed a wide range of melodramas and comedies, plays most commonly viewed by 19th century audiences. The Showboat Players are most known for their whimsical olios. Many well-known performers today received their first taste of professional theatre as a Showboat Player; Loni Anderson, Linda Kelsey, Peter MacNicol, Peter Michael Goetz, and Jon Cranney to name a few. Olios are musical entertainment pieces performed either between scenes or as an afterpiece to relieve the tension created by the melodrama and its serious storyline. University of Minnesota Professor Robert Darrell Moulton, who created many of the olios performed, found it important to have the olios be in contrast to the play, but be in tune with it stylistically and thematically. The olios mainly depend on the performers' strengths; they may also use a clever ""gimmick"" or surprise. It is essential in an olio to present romance, nostalgia, color, extravagance, and affectionate fun. Olios have been a favorite among the Showboat audiences, and this was mainly due in part to Bob Moulton drawing upon his talents as a dancer, costumer, choreographer, and director. 44°56′23″N 93°5′45″W﻿ ﻿44.93972°N 93.09583°W﻿ 44.93972; -93.09583",Normal

From 3 March 2015, she served as a senator replacing Eduardo Bonomi, who was ratified as Minister of the Interior for the Broad Front government installed on 1 March. Ivonne Passada was born in Montevideo on 4 April 1956. She completed her primary and secondary studies at Colegio Clara Jackson de Heber. She then entered the Faculty of Law of the University of the Republic. However, she ended up studying sociology at the university's Social Sciences Institute, then taking industrial security courses at the Universidad del Trabajo del Uruguay (UTU). Beginning in 1984, she worked as a professor at UTU, and as a teacher of industrial safety, tasks that she performed until 2004. Passada was an active militant of the neighborhood and development commissions of the Malvín Norte area. From 1984 she was part of the democratic reconstruction of the education unions and the PIT-CNT; she was among the leadership of the Association of UTU Officials (AFUTU) from 1985 to 2002. From 2002 to 2004 she was a member of the PIT-CNT and its Secretariat, being one of the coordinators. Passada started her militant career in the Tupamaros National Liberation Movement in 1985, and in 2002 she joined the National Directorate of the Movement of Popular Participation (MPP), a political sector of the Broad Front. In the national elections of 31 October 2004, Ivonne Passada was elected alternate deputy.

"Jerudong Football Club (Malay: Kelab Bola Sepak Jerudong) is a Bruneian professional football club that last competed in the Brunei Super League. With almost 30 years of service, the club has experienced its fair share of highs and lows while competing in the various leagues. The club has worked to get better with every win and especially with every loss, starting with the early days of the Brunei-Muara District League and continuing through the current Brunei Super League. Which is not surprising given that their team manager, Jalaludin Ghazali, has always been the club's motivating drive and brings an equal amount of tenacity to winning. The club has continued to develop young players of the greatest caliber thanks to its very high standards in training and organization. Jerudong FC was founded in 1994, by Murni Mohammad and was started by a group of passionately enthusiastic football players who viewed football as a way to help the young in their community reach their full potential. As they had previously started out as little more than local villagers playing on the field, Jerudong FC draws its membership from across any community that is ready to join them. The membership then expanded beyond families and friends to include children of all ages and can accommodate players of all skill levels, from absolute novices to those with prior experience competing in both youth and adult competitions. The club takes pleasure in fostering potential and skill in football, boasting a strong roster of highly skilled athletes who have received intensive coaching training. This is because, as a non-profit club, they always do their best to support the team members by giving them access to the appropriate facilities, gear, and equipment to help inspire young people to take an active role in football. This involves arranging friendly games with Malaysia, including Labuan, Sabah, and Sarawak, to provide players a chance to play outside of their comfort zones and to demonstrate their potential and skill on the field. Football was originally intended to provide a platform for adolescents to engage in more positive activities and stay away from activities that can be harmful to their wellbeing. These days, the club helps its players improve their abilities, techniques, and game knowledge so they can reach their maximum potential and, ultimately, create a route to Brunei representative football. Since then, the club has produced numerous remarkable athletes, many of whom have left Jerudong FC to pursue their own interests both on and off the field. Jerudong took part in the 2022 FA Cup, managing to qualify for the knockout phase but was defeated by eventual winners DPMM FC. Since their primary playing and training facility is situated on Jerudong Primary School Field, where they would train up to three times a week in preparation for any future matches, the club has strong ties to the community. They are one of the rare clubs that can boast having their own home field. Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.",Normal

"Product innovation is the creation and subsequent introduction of a goods or service that is either new, or an improved version of previous goods or services. This is broader than the normally accepted definition of innovation that includes the invention of new products which, in this context, are still considered innovative. Product innovation is defined as: the development of new products, changes in design of established products, or use of new materials or components in the manufacture of established products Numerous examples of product innovation include introducing new products, enhanced quality and improving its overall performance. Product innovation, alongside cost-cutting innovation and process innovation, are three different classifications of innovation which aim to develop a company's production methods. Thus product innovation can be divided into two categories of innovation: radical innovation which aims at developing a new product, and incremental innovation which aims at improving existing products. Advantages of product innovation include: Disadvantages of product innovation include: Popular theories of product innovation - what causes it and how it is achieved - include Outcome-Driven Innovation and ""Jobs to be Done"" (JTBD). JTBD Theory is used extensively as part of a methodical approach to product innovation postulating that users ""hire"" a product to do a ""job"" and that innovation can be achieved by providing a better way of getting a particular job done. Used as a framework, JTBD is very similar to outcome-driven innovation, focusing on the functional, emotional, and social 'jobs' that users want to perform. However, this is one of two main interpretations of the theory known as ""Jobs-as-action."" The second interpretation is known as ""Jobs-as-progress"" and focuses on what the user wants to be, stating that the jobs a product user wants to do are secondary to (and a result of) the person they want to be. New product development is the initial step before the product life cycle can be examined, and plays a vital role in the manufacturing process. To prevent loss of profits or liquidation for businesses in the long term, new products have to be created to replace the old products. Peter Drucker suggests in his book 'Innovation and Entrepreneurship' that both product innovation and entrepreneurship are interconnected and must be used together in unison for a business to be successful, and this relates to the process of new product development. These are the few stages that a business has to undergo when introducing a new product line into the market: After all these stages have been successfully run through, then the business can officially launch the product. Product innovation can be classified by degree of technical novelty and by type of novelty in terms of market. Technical product innovations include the use of new materials, the use of new intermediate products, new functional parts, the use of radically new technology and fundamental new functions. Classification by levels of novelty include new only to the firm, new to the industry in the country or to the operating market of the firm, or new to the world. Existing product development is a process of innovation where productsservices are redesigned, refurbished, improved, and manufactured which can be at a lower cost. This will provide benefits to both the company and the consumer in different ways; for example, increased revenue (benefits the company) cheaper costs (benefits the company and consumer) or even benefits the environment by implementation of 'green' production methods. The Oslo Manual recommends certain guidelines for measuring innovation through the measurement of aspects in the innovation process and innovation expenditure. Measurement processes consists of collecting and systemizing qualitative and quantitative data regarding different factors of the innovation process, investment and outcome. Quantitative analysis focus on investment, impact and life cycle. Examples of key quantitative indicators include product investment, total innovation investment, product sales share that comes from innovation, manpower use, material consumption, energy consumption, time taken to reach the commercialisation phase or the expected cost recovery or payback period. Qualitative data includes benefits of the innovation, sources of information or ideas for the innovation, and diffusion or reach of innovation. Even though similar information can be obtained through quantitative methods, the guidelines argues that due to the qualitative nature of the answers, firms are inclined to provide richer and a different set of data, avoiding duplication. While the difference between different forms of innovation seems intuitively clear, it is not always obvious what kind of innovation is occurring in practice. While there are different dimensions to consider whether it is a product innovation rather than e.g. a technology or business model innovation, it is not always possible to clearly differentiate one from the other. For example, compared to a business model innovation, a product innovation often has:",Normal
"The Revelation of Stephen or Apocalypse of Stephen is a text of New Testament apocrypha. It features Saint Stephen, one of the Seven Deacons to the Twelve apostles. The text describes a conflict at the very beginnings of Christianity about the nature of Jesus of Nazareth. Stephen appears on the scene and recounts Revelation as a literal truth, to which the crowd declare blasphemy, and Caiaphas has him arrested and beaten. The text then has Stephen appear before Pontius Pilate, whom he tells to not speak, and orders him to recognize Jesus. The tale is set before Paul of Tarsus' conversion, and so proceeds to describe how Paul persecutes Stephen by having him crucified. However, an angel rescues Stephen, so SaulPaul has molten lead poured into his mouth and ears, and nails into his heart and feet, but an angel heals him again. The next day, the text proclaims that Stephen was led out to be judged before the crowd, but instead Stephen recounts a supposed prophecy by Nathan of Jesus's coming, which annoys the guards to the extent that they bind him and take him to the head of the guard. The Sanhedrin decide that Stephen should be stoned, but Nicodemus and Gamaliel (the Jewish scholar) try to defend him with their bodies, dying in the process. After ten hours, Stephen eventually dies, and is buried in a silver coffin by Pilate, against Stephen's wishes. An angel moves the body to where Stephen wished to be buried, making Pilate shocked by the loss of the bodies. Pilate then receives a vision of Stephen, and converts. Likewise the memory of Stephen is said by the text to have made Paul convert. Many scholars think that Pilate was a later addition to the text, the involvement of Pilate in the story looking somewhat clumsy, and the text being primarily an attempt to explain Paul's motives for conversion, but also his prior villainy. Furthermore, most scholars agree that Pontius Pilate was no longer the Prefect of Judaea by the time of Stephen's martyrdom, having been recalled to Rome and replaced by acting prefect Marcellus.

"William Edward ""Wid"" Conroy (April 5, 1877 – December 6, 1959) was an American Major League Baseball player active during the first decade of the 20th century. Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on April 5, 1877, Conroy made his major league debut on April 25, 1901, with the Milwaukee Brewers at the age of 24. He played his last game on October 5, 1911, for the Washington Senators, retiring at 34 years. Standing at 5' 9"" (177cm) and weighing 158lb. (72kg), Conroy epitomized the role of a utility man, playing every infield and outfield position in his 11-season career. He played for the Milwaukee Brewers (1901), Pittsburgh Pirates (1902), New York Yankees (1903–1908), Washington Senators (1909–1911). Conroy began his career as a shortstop, replacing Honus Wagner with Paterson in the Atlantic League, but was struck by malarial fever and dropped from the team. In 1900 Connie Mack invited him to try out for the Western Association team he would field in Milwaukee and transfer to Philadelphia when the American League began as a major circuit; Conroy won the last spot on the roster. Conroy was the first-string shortstop of the NL champion 1902 Pirates but became a third baseman when he returned to the AL with the Highlanders (later the Yankees) in 1903. He led AL third basemen twice in total chances per game. His 22-year career in pro baseball ended as a Philadelphia Phillies coach in 1922. During his prime, Conroy consistently ranked in the top ten in most offensive categories as well as in stolen bases. He was an opening day starter for the New York Highlanders during the first five years of the team's existence (1903–1907). Batting and throwing right-handed, Conroy led the New York Highlanders with 4 home runs in 1906 and was fifth in the league overall. He also stole 41 bases in 1907, second only to Ty Cobb, who swiped 49 that year. On September 25, 1911, he set an AL record with 13 total chances at 3B in a 3–2 loss to Cleveland. In 1,377 career games, Conroy batted .248 with 22 home runs and 452 RBIs. In the 1945 BBWAA Hall of Fame voting, Conroy obtained 1 vote and a percentage of .4. Wid Conroy died on December 6, 1959, in Mount Holly, New Jersey, and is buried at Mount Carmel Cemetery, in Moorestown, New Jersey.",Normal

"The Danny Kaye Show is an American old-time radio comedy-variety program. Broadcast on the CBS radio network, it ran from January 6, 1945 to May 31, 1946. The Danny Kaye Show featured singing, instrumental music, and various kinds of comedy sketches. In Nobody's Fool, Martin Gottfried wrote about the program: ""Everything about it was to be top drawer, beginning with Kaye's then record salary of $16,000 a week (compared to the $100 apiece he had been paid for three minor CBS radio shows in 1940)."" In addition to Kaye, the cast included Eve Arden, Lionel Stander, and Frank Nelson as regulars, with the supporting cast including Kenny Delmar, Everett Sloane, Joan Edwards, and Butterfly McQueen. Announcers were Ken Niles and Dick Joy. Music was under the direction of Harry James, Lyn Murray, David Terry, and Harry Sosnik. Dick Mack was the director. The producer was Goodman Ace, described by Gottfried in Nobody's Fool as ""radio's premier comedy writer, who had so estimable a reputation that even though the program would be broadcast from Los Angeles, he was able to insist on running it from New York."" A behind-the-scenes influence was Kaye's wife, Sylvia Fine, a producer, composer, and lyricist in her own right. Gottfried wrote, ""She demanded and won the right to approve the show's writers.""

This gene belongs to the AB subfamily of ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). The hnRNPs are RNA binding proteins and they complex with heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). These proteins are associated with pre-mRNAs in the nucleus and appear to influence pre-mRNA processing and other aspects of mRNA metabolism and transport. While all of the hnRNPs are present in the nucleus, some seem to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The hnRNP proteins have distinct nucleic acid binding properties.

"Santiago Cordero (born 6 December 1993) is an Argentine rugby union player currently playing for Connacht in the United Rugby Championship. He plays as wing or fullback. Santiago Cordero played for Regatas from 2012 to 2015. His first test match for Argentina was the 31–12 loss to England, at 9 November 2013, in Twickenham Stadium, when he was 19 years old. Cordero played one match in the 2013 End-of-year rugby union test for the Barbarians against Fiji, at the Centenary Match to mark 100 years of rugby in Fiji. Santiago caught the attention of a wider rugby audience during the 2015 World Cup with his pace and stepping skills, having scored memorable tries, two against Georgia (in which he was named ""Man of the Match"") and one against Tonga. His clean breaks and distance covered were also noteworthy, thus making significant contributions to Argentina's fourth place in the tournament. Cordero scored one try for the Argentinian side that beat the Barbarians 49–31 in the 2015 Killik Cup match, held at Twickenham on 21 November 2015. In 2016 and 2017 he played for Jaguares, the Argentinian team in Super Rugby. He joined Exeter Chiefs in the Premiership Rugby in early 2018 as a medical joker, and became a full-time player for the 2018–19 season. Cordero signed for Exeter Chiefs in 2018 and has since played 33 games scoring 10 tries.

"The Percy R. Pyne House (also known as the Percy Rivington Pyne House and Percy & Maud H. Pyne House) is a neo-Federal townhouse at 680 Park Avenue, located at the northwest corner of Park Avenue and 68th Street in Manhattan. Currently, the Americas Society uses the building as its New York City headquarters. Designed by McKim, Mead & White for Percy Rivington Pyne II, grandson of the noted financier Moses Taylor, it was built from 1909 to 1911. Its materials and scale established a character that was followed by the architects of all the subsequent houses on this Park Avenue blockfront. The building was occupied by the Soviet Mission to the United Nations from 1948 to 1963. The generous actions of the Margaret Rockefeller Strong de Larraín, Marquesa de Cuevas, in acquiring the property in 1965 and presenting it to the Americas Society, saved the building from destruction. Together with the buildings of the neighboring Oliver D. Filley House (now the Queen Sofía Spanish Institute) at 684 Park Avenue and the Henry P. Davison House (now the Italian Consulate General) at 690 Park Avenue, it forms one of the last intact architectural ensembles on Park Avenue. The building was designated as a New York City landmark by the New York City Landmark Preservation Commission on November 10, 1970.

"Acuity Brands, Inc. is a lighting and building management firm headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, with operations throughout North America and in Europe and Asia. It currently has about 13,000 employees and recorded net sales of $3.7 billion for fiscal year 2018. In terms of market share, Acuity Brands is the largest lighting manufacturer in North America. The roots of Acuity Brands date back to 1919 when Isadore M. Weinstein founded the Atlanta Linen Supply company. Weinstein had previously been employed in the towel supply business in Cleveland, and after serving in World War I, he started his own business renting towels, uniforms, and linens. He opened several locations throughout the south, changing the name to the Southern Linen Service Corporation in 1920. The company went public in 1928 as National Linen Service Corporation and continued to grow, eventually expanding to markets in the southwest and west coast. By 1944, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Following World War II, Weinstein's son, Milton, had taken over the company. In the 1950s, National Linen faced an antitrust suit due to its dominance in the otherwise fragmented linens industry. The suit was settled in 1956, and in an effort to assuage future antitrust concerns, the company began to diversify. National Linen's first acquisition outside of linens and uniforms was Zep Manufacturing Company, an Atlanta-based chemical and janitorial supply manufacturer, in 1962. Zep became synonymous with NSI's chemical division, acquiring Selig Chemical Industries in 1968 and several smaller acquisitions throughout the 1970s and 1980s. To better reflect its new variety of business units, National Linen became National Service Industries (NSI) in 1964. Zep co-founder Erwin Zaban, who had stayed on following the company's acquisition and was also Weinstein's neighbor, took over NSI's operation in 1966. In 1969, NSI acquired Lithonia Lighting Inc., a light fixture manufacturer founded in Georgia in 1946, and established a lighting division. Along with the chemical division that grew out of the Zep acquisition, the lighting division that grew out of the Lithonia Lighting acquisition formed the foundation for what would eventually become Acuity Brands. NSI acquired several other lighting manufacturers over the next 30 years, the largest of which occurred in 1999, when Ohio-based Holophane Corporation, a large outdoor and industrial lighting manufacturer, was purchased. Zaban continued NSI's new expansion strategy of acquiring profitable companies without much consideration for synergy among the company's increasing number of business units throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Six business units remained at the core of NSI's operations: linens, chemicals, lighting, insulation, envelopes, and printing. However, the total number of business units ebbed and flowed throughout this period as Zaban acquired companies in a variety of other industries and divested as soon as they became unprofitable. By the 1990s, NSI's lighting and chemical divisions made up more than half of the company's revenues and operating incomes combined, and both divisions were still rapidly growing. In 1992, NSI added Graham Group, Europe's second-largest specialty chemical manufacturer at the time, and Kleen Canada to its chemical division. NSI added outdoor lighting company Infranor Canada in 1995 and invested in a fluorescent lighting manufacturing facility in Monterrey, Mexico that would serve the entire North American market. The chemical division expanded further in 1997 with the acquisition of Enforcer Products and Pure Corporation. In 2001, National Service Industries announced it would combine the lighting and chemical divisions and spin off that combined entity as a separate, publicly traded company. Initially incorporated as L&C Spinco in June 2001, it was renamed Acuity Brands in November of the same year. James S. Balloun, who had taken over as CEO of NSI in the mid-1990s, moved with the spinoff to serve as the president, CEO, and chairman of the board. In part due to the weak economy that spurred NSI to spin off the new company in the first place, Acuity Brands struggled in its first few years. Balloun retired in September 2004 and was replaced by Vernon J. Nagel, who had joined the firm as executive vice president and chief financial officer in December 2001. Beginning in 2005, Nagel led a restructuring effort that resulted in splitting Acuity Brands into two distinct, publicly traded brands in July 2007. The company's chemical division, Acuity Specialty Products, spun off as Zep, Inc. and included the Zep, Enforcer, and Selig brands. The remaining Acuity Brands, Inc. became the holding company for Acuity Brands Lighting which included the Lithonia Lighting, Holophane, Peerless, and Mark Architectural brands, among others. Nagel's tenure as CEO saw the transition of the lighting industry to LED lighting as well as the rise of smart lighting and the internet of things. Acuity grew with these changes in technology, launching the Atrius IoT brand in 2017 after the acquisitions of Sensor Switch and organic creation of brands such as nLight and ROAM. After 16 years as president and CEO, Nagel stepped aside into an executive chairman role, and Neil Ashe was named the new head of the company. The firm's products include luminaires, lighting controls, building system controllers, prismatic skylights, drivers, power supplies and integrated systems for indoor and outdoor applications in commercial, industrial, institutional, infrastructure and residential spaces. They include recessed, surface, suspended, downlight, decorative, track and emergency indoor luminaires as well as outdoor lighting for street and roadway, parking, flood, landscape, site, area and underwater applications. It also provides digital networked lighting, building management and IoT. modular wiring, LED drivers, photo controls, occupancy sensors, dimming panels, relay panels, integrated lighting control systems, and products and services related to networked technology, building automation and building analytics. The firm markets its products and services under a variety of brand names. The firm's acquisitions have focused on technology: LED lighting (including tunable lighting), controls, intelligent drivers, connected lighting, indoor location services, building management and building analytics.",Normal
"The 2002 season was the Atlanta Falcons' 37th in the National Football League (NFL) and their first in the newly formed NFC South. It was also the team's first season under new owner Arthur Blank, who acquired the team during the 2002 offseason. The team improved upon their previous season's output of 7–9 and qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998. The team was also involved in a rare tie, matching the Pittsburgh Steelers 34–34 at the end of overtime. This was the last time the Atlanta Falcons ended a season with a tie. Before the season, the Falcons acquired running back Warrick Dunn to help with the team’s running game. Their running game had suffered the past three years. Dunn finished the season with 927 rushing yards and 9 total touchdowns. With the boost of Dunn, the Falcons rushed for 2,368 yards (148 yards per game) and 23 touchdowns, both the fourth-best in the NFL. After seeing limited action as a rookie, this was Michael Vick's first full season as starting quarterback. In the Wild Card Game, Vick and the Falcons defeated the Brett Favre-led Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field, 27–7, giving the Packers their first ever playoff loss in Lambeau. However, a 20–6 loss to Donovan McNabb and the Philadelphia Eagles in the next round kept the Falcons from advancing in the playoffs. This was Dan Reeves' last full season as head coach as he was replaced by interim Wade Phillips during the following season.

"Real Time with Bill Maher is an American television talk show that airs weekly on HBO, hosted by comedian and political satirist Bill Maher. Much like his previous series Politically Incorrect on Comedy Central and later on ABC, Real Time features a panel of guests who discuss current events in politics and the media. Unlike the previous show, guests are usually better versed in the subject matter; more experts such as journalists, professors, and politicians participate in the panel, and fewer actors and celebrities are included. Real Time is a weekly hour-long program with a studio audience, and is broadcast from Studio 33 at Television City in Los Angeles. Prior to Season 20, the program aired on Friday nights at 10:00pm ET, however, it now pre-recorded at 7:00pm ET. In addition, a 10–15-minute ""Overtime"" segment quickly follows the show on YouTube live stream, which answers questions posted by viewers through HBO's online website for the show. In September 2021, HBO announced that the show had been renewed for two additional seasons, keeping the show on the air through 2024. The show's 21st season premiered on January 20, 2023. From February 3, 2023, the post-show Overtime segment was added to CNN Tonight programming. The show's 22nd season will premiere on January 19, 2024. The opening sequence contains a theme song composed by Christopher ""Kid"" Reid. A montage of animated graphics with political and cultural themes surrounded by splashes of color accompanies the music. Season 21 features an updated version of the theme song performed by Green Day and incorporates a pulsing guitar with the original thumping beat. The show opens with a comedy monologue performed by Maher, followed by a one-on-one interview with a prominent guest. Maher then engages with two or three additional panel guests, who partake in various discussions and debates. Midway through the panel session, Maher performs a comedic bit that typically satirizes a notable current event. The final segment of each episode is entitled ""New Rules"" and contains an array of editorials related to popular culture and American politics. The final ""New Rule"" serves as Maher's closing editorial monologue. While the aforementioned format is typically followed, Maher states that it is not entirely rigid and has also indicated that he prefers in-studio interviews to satellite interviews. Since the show airs on HBO, Maher and his guests are allowed to use profane language, a significant departure from the broadcast standards that existed on Politically Incorrect. Graphics displayed throughout the show may also contain some uncensored content. During the first season, Paul F. Tompkins was featured as a correspondent, and each episode would conclude with a performance by a stand-up comedian. The segments featuring Tompkins and the stand-up comedians were dropped after episode 10. Viewers were also able to engage over the air during the first season by calling in live, but this practice was subsequently discontinued. Starting with episode 67, audio-only versions of the show were made available as free podcasts via the iTunes Store and as raw RSS feeds. The podcasts may also feature bonus material taped during studio rehearsal, such as additional ""New Rules"" that were not included in the final broadcast. During Season 4, Maher began hosting a live chat (now called ""Overtime"") with his guests immediately following each broadcast. Viewers are invited to submit questions and topics for Maher and the other participants to answer and discuss. This post-show event was initially featured on HBO's website and is currently broadcast on CNN. Maher has been a critic of the Obama administration, the Bush administration and the Trump administration. His panel attempts to present a diverse set of views. Frequently, it consists of a liberal commentator or political figure, a conservative commentator or political figure, and a third individual who does not have as clear an ideological label, or someone with moderate beliefs. This third individual is often an actor, comedian, musician, or other entertainment figure, though many times the commentator is openly conservative or liberal. On his previous TV series, Politically Incorrect, Maher used the word ""libertarian"" to describe his political leanings. Regarding religion, he considers himself a ""rationalist"", as someone ""preaching the gospel of 'I don't know'"". Maher identifies himself as politically unaffiliated and disagrees with the Republican party on many issues, and with the Democratic Party on many of their party platform's planks. He endorsed the candidacy of Ralph Nader of the Green Party during his 2000 presidential campaign. After the 2000 election, Maher was among those who felt that votes cast by progressives for Nader possibly cost Democratic candidate Al Gore the election, and put George W. Bush in the White House. During an episode on which Nader and Michael Moore were guests, both Maher and Moore begged Nader not to run again in 2004. Maher endorsed Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry leading up to the 2004 presidential election. In 2008, he endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and harshly criticized Republican candidate John McCain's political campaign. He also heavily criticized McCain's vice presidential pick, Sarah Palin, on her qualifications and intelligence. Maher interviewed then presidential-candidate, Republican Ron Paul, giving him some positive air time. He often cites Paul's views in order to demonstrate the diversity of views on the right. Maher has used Real Time to bring voters attention to current political races. In 2014, Real Time launched a campaign called ""Flip a district."" The objective was for Real Time's to audience directly effect the outcome of an upcoming congressional race where Maher felt the incumbent candidate had voted or behaved badly. The show's executive producer Scott Carter told the New York Times that they were considering both Republicans and Democrats but “with our viewers voting, I imagine it is much more likely we will pick a Republican."" Republican Minnesota Rep. John Kline was eventually selected but was not unseated in that election despite the Real Time campaign. Maher has strong opinions on US drug policy, advocating for the legalization of marijuana. He is against censorship, often citing his own dismissal from ABC and the backlash against the Dixie Chicks for their comments on the Iraq War. He is also against conservative attitudes towards sex and sexuality, mocking outrages over the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal and Janet Jackson's ""wardrobe malfunction"". He is also not shy about his lack of religious beliefs and he frequently criticizes religion. He is widely known for his support of animal rights groups such as PETA. Hot-button political issues such as health care, corporate influence in government, illegal immigration, the environment, entitlement programs, and human service regulations are frequently discussed on the show. On September 17, 2010, Maher aired a clip of Delaware Republican Senatorial candidate Christine O'Donnell from the October 29, 1999, episode of his prior TV series Politically Incorrect, where she discussed that she had ""dabbled in witchcraft"". This was perhaps the most notable of numerous controversial statements by O'Donnell that made her the most covered candidate in the 2010 mid-term election cycle. O'Donnell went on to film a rebuttal commercial claiming ""I'm not a witch, I'm you."" This ad inspired many video parodies and O'Donnell later said that the ad backfired and focused attention on her decade-old statement. O'Donnell lost to her Democratic opponent, Chris Coons, in the general election. On the September 7, 2012, episode of Real Time with Bill Maher, O'Donnell appeared on the show for the first time and resolved the issue with Maher, who apologized for the amount of publicity that the clip garnered. Maher said that he would not have aired the clip if he knew that it would have taken away from the message of her campaign. The show returned on January 11, 2008, and began broadcasting in high definition, with updates to the set for HD display. As a result of the writers' strike, in Season 6, the opening skit, the ""New Rules"" segment, and the closing monologue were eliminated for five episodes at the beginning of the year. The ice breaker used in the middle of the show (normally a fake products sketch tying into a current event) was also eliminated due to the strike. The announcement that Real Time would return without writers indicated that the opening monologue would also be cut, but every episode included a full monologue. The initial season finale of Season Five was to air on November 9, 2007, and was to feature Ben Affleck, George Carlin, and Tom Brokaw as guests, but was canceled due to the strike. During the strike, the ""Overtime"" concept became part of the live show itself, through a new segment called ""Blogga, Please!"". Using HBO's website, viewers were able to leave comments or questions during the live show. Maher and the panel then responded to selected postings at the end of the show. The ""Blogga, Please!"" segment was discontinued, and ""New Rules"" brought back, on February 15 following the resolution of the strike. Additionally, during the strike, Maher aired pre-recorded interviews by himself with everyday people about the election and other issues after the opening monologue. Established early on, the final ""New Rule"" served as a segue into the closing monologue. On the March 7 episode, the closing monologue returned to the format of the show. The opening skits did not reappear, except for April 4 and 11, 2008. Instead of doing a second satellite interview near the forty-minute mark, the January 11 episode also featured the debut of the ""Real Time Real Reporter"", a blogger or political pundit who is brought on midway through the show as an extra panelist to offer opinions on the latest election campaign happenings. Such correspondents have included Matt Taibbi, Frank Luntz, Amy Holmes, P.J. O'Rourke, and Dan Savage. The 2009 premiere was on February 20 at the earlier time of 10:00pm EST. The opening sequence was also slightly changed to include then President-elect Barack Obama and his family waving to a crowd of supporters on election night in November 2008. Also, the show aired one continuous season as opposed to airing episodes in the spring and fall with a summer break in between. For a short time the Real Time panel was reduced from three panelists to two for the new season. Maher jokingly attributed the new panel line-up to the economic crisis, stating that it was a means of reining in spending for the HBO show; Maher later stated that there is no connection between the failing economy and the producers' decision to remove the third guest. During his show on March 13, 2009, Maher reacted to the confusion sparked by his remarks from his previous show regarding the panel stating, ""I said as a joke that we had cut down the panel to two people because of economic times, and people took me seriously. No. It's just because I'm tired of talking to three people sometimes."" The panel was once again at three panelists for the show one week later, on March 20. In addition to the panel reconfiguration, Maher has instituted a one-on-one in-studio interview segment in lieu of the past seasons' satellite interviews. The interview with James Carville on the May 8 show, however, was conducted via satellite. HBO renewed the show on April 24, 2012, for two more seasons through 2013–14. The first episode of Season 11 aired on January 18, 2013, retaining its format of an initial monologue from Maher, a one-on-one interview with a guest, then turning to a discussion panel of three guests, and ending with ""New Rules"". A new addition to the format is that of a fourth or ""mid-guest"", who comes in at approximately the halfway point of the show, bringing their own issue to the table and discussing it with the entire panel. In 2017, Real Time debuted a new theme song and a new set. The new theme song continues in the path of its predecessor by showcasing important political events including the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States. The new season retained the basic format of the show– a top-of-the-show guest, a table discussion and a mid-show guest. The biggest change in terms of set design has been that the main table where Bill Maher and two or three guests discuss current political events is moved closer to the audience after the top of the show interview is completed. In addition to this, some mid-show guests including Leah Remini, Jake Tapper, Ralph Reed and Barbra Streisand have been interviewed on a separate side table. Though mid-show guests like Remini and Tapper have not taken part in any discussion on the main show after their interview or appeared on Overtime, the segment which is broadcast on YouTube, other guests like Reed have. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Real Time moved from Studio 33 to being taped from Maher's home in Beverly Hills with guests appearing remotely from the April 3, 2020, episode to August 23, 2020. Bill Maher and his production team returned to their usual studio on August 28, 2020, their first show produced back in studio since March 2020. Changes to production were made for the return to the studio, with no live studio audience, the continuation of using a fake laugh track and archive clips of audiences applauding and laughing during Maher's opening monologue, along with social distancing of the crew and interviews with guests via the internetsatellite connections. Since February 5, 2021, the show has allowed regular audience attendees in the studio who have tested negative for COVID-19. Beginning with the April 3, 2020, episode of Season 18, until the August 21, 2020, episode, Real Time with Bill Maher had temporarily adjusted its format. All the episodes from this period were filmed from Maher's home starting with a monologue either from Maher's garden, elsewhere on the grounds of his property, or the living room. The duration of the show consisted of three to four in-depth guest interviews instead of the long-form panel discussion as guests appeared remotely while Maher recorded the discussion from his ""man cave"" or from his garden. The show ended with ""New Rules"" from Maher's garden. There was no ""Overtime"" segment. On August 28, 2020, Bill Maher returned to the studio, but with no audience and guests appearing remotely over a video screen. From September 11, 2020, to October 30, 2020, and November 13, 2020, a limited audience was brought in with some guests appearing remotely while others are in studio. November 6, 2020, featured the first show with a limited audience, mainly the staff writers, and all guests appearing in the studio. A format that has been done consistently since the Season 18 finale on November 20, 2020, into Season 19. Since February 5, 2021, of Season 19, the show has allowed regular audience attendees in the studio who have tested negative for COVID-19. After the monologue, Maher speaks with the first guest appearing in the studio sitting in the armchairs moved six feet apart across from another. The panel discussion involves two guests sitting six feet apart from one another across from Maher at the discussion table. And no ""Overtime"" segment. The season 19 episode scheduled for May 14, 2021, was canceled after Maher tested positive for COVID-19 during the show's weekly testing for COVID. The episode was to feature Neil deGrasse Tyson, Max Brooks, and Dan Carlin as guests. The following May 21 show was canceled as a precaution. For season 20, the show does not air live, rather it is pre-recorded at 7:00 pm ET with the 10:00 pm ET airing unchanged with the same three guest format from the previous season. ""Overtime"" returned on January 21, 2022, following the season premiere. Instead of the usual four guests format, it is the three guests, the first guest interviewed after the monologue, and the two guests who sit with Maher at the discussion table during the rest of the show. This format has continued into season 21. The response to the first season was mostly mixed. On Metacritic, it has a score of 43% based on reviews from 5 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"". Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker said ""There’s also more of Maher in the new show, and it’s no big surprise that more Maher is less. He’s a jerk of the old school, full of unexamined anxiety and arrogance, with a habit of using sexual stereotypes from half a century ago both to put down and to compliment people."" The New York Times called the show ""Fox News of the antiwar movement"" and described it as ""a flagrantly liberal talk show that provides like-minded viewers with instant gratification."" Television host Larry King called Real Time ""one of the best shows on television"". Maher was a regular guest on Larry King Live as well as co-host at various times, and co-emcee of the final show, along with Ryan Seacrest. Common Sense Media's website says, ""Comedian Bill Maher is very funny, very well-informed, and very insightful, but he's also very crass."" It later says, ""Maher also expects his audience to have plenty of tolerance for blue humor. His jokes are profane and riddled with explicit sexual references, and he often pokes fun at the use and abuse of alcohol and other intoxicants. It's funny, but it's very much aimed at adults."" The site gives Real Time with Bill Maher an ""overall quality"" rating of 4 out of 5 stars. Ruthless Reviews was also positive, saying, ""Maher's show is as good as ever, which means that the sacred and the profane continue to be discussed with intelligence, humor, and the occasional silliness"" and that it ""works so well because he selects provocative guests and I can't remember the panel ever having a dull conversation. Maher is smart and witty (and clearly in control), which means that he won't let his guests get away with bullshit."" Two books by Maher based on the show have been published: The show was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Series every year from 2005 through 2014 and for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Talk Series in 2016 and 2017.",Normal

"The Tears of the White Man: Compassion as Contempt (French: Le Sanglot de l'homme blanc. Tiers-Monde, culpabilité, haine de soi) is a 1983 book by the French philosopher Pascal Bruckner. It describes how the political left of the Western world has a sentimental view of the Third World. Bruckner criticises this and how it is used to revel in self-hatred and perceived guilt. The book was published in English in 1986, translated by William R. Beer. Roger Kimball regards Bruckner's 2006 book The Tyranny of Guilt as a sequel to The Tears of the White Man. Intellectual historian Richard Wolin described Tears of the White Man as ""an unflinching attempt to come to grips with the conceit of Third Worldism... As the dreams of Soviet style Communism gradually soured, many on the left had transposed their allegiances to revolutionary insurgencies in the Southern Hemisphere: in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. They placed their chips on the virtue and the power of (Frantz Fanon's) 'the wretched of the earth.'"" Kirkus Reviews wrote: ""Throughout Bruckner's debate, the tone of vehement insensitivity to possible ether points of view is reminiscent of the most egoistic American political writers. But Bruckner, as a novelist, has much greater verbal resources than most political hacks. Unfortunately, most of this is lost in an inept translation: in most political books, a humdrum translation may suffice, but Bruckner is so dependent on a musketeer-like verbal flourish that only the best French translators should have attempted this job."" Writing in Foreign Affairs in 1987, Fritz Stern described the book as ""a diatribe against the ideologues of Western guilt, against pious compassion with and exaltation of Third World countries"" which ""turns into a polemic, sometimes against straw men"". Stern added, ""Altogether, a book that by being contemptuous itself misses its own considerable potential"".",Normal

"Nathaniel Heckford (1842–1871) was a paediatrician in Victorian London, who founded the East London Hospital for Children. He met his future wife, Sarah Goff, during the 1866 cholera epidemic in Wapping, where he first determined a need for a children's hospital in the East End of London. Heckford died of tuberculosis (then known as consumption) at the age of 29. The hospital started in 1868 in a warehouse in Ratcliffe, and moved after his death to Glamis Road, Shadwell. It was the first London hospital for children under two years of age. It was described in some detail by Charles Dickens in two pieces called 'A Small Star in the East' and 'On An Amateur Beat' published in The Uncommercial Traveller. In 1932 it was renamed the Princess Elizabeth of York Hospital for Children. A decade later, it amalgamated with the Queen's Hospital for Children, which had been founded in 1867 as the Dispensary for Women and Children. The newly merged institution was called Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children until its closure in 1963. Heckford Street, off the east end of The Highway, commemorates Dr. Heckford.

"Sula bassana (Linnaeus,1758) Pelecanus bassanus Linnaeus,1758 Sula americana Bonaparte, 1838 The northern gannet (Morus bassanus) is a seabird, the largest species of the gannet family, Sulidae. It is native to the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean, breeding in Western Europe and Northeastern North America. It is the largest seabird in the northern Atlantic. The sexes are similar in appearance. The adult northern gannet has a mainly white streamlined body with a long neck, and long and slender wings. It is 87–100cm (34+1⁄2–39+1⁄2in) long with a 170–180cm (67–71in) wingspan. The head and nape have a buff tinge that is more prominent in breeding season, and the wings are edged with dark brown-black feathers. The long, pointed bill is blue-grey, contrasting with black, bare skin around the mouth and eyes. Juveniles are mostly grey-brown, becoming increasingly white in the five years it takes them to reach maturity. Nesting takes place in colonies on both sides of the North Atlantic, the largest of which are at Bass Rock (75,000 pairs as of 2014), St. Kilda (60,000 pairs as of 2013) and Ailsa Craig (33,000 pairs as of 2014) in Scotland, Grassholm in Wales, and Bonaventure Island (60,000 pairs in 2009) off the coast of Quebec. Its breeding range has extended northward and eastward, with colonies being established on Russia's Kola Peninsula in 1995 and Bear Island (the southernmost island of Svalbard), in 2011. Colonies are mostly located on offshore islands with cliffs, from which the birds can more easily launch into the air. The northern gannet undertakes seasonal migrations and catches fish (which are the mainstay of its diet) by making high-speed dives into the sea. The northern gannet was previously hunted for food in certain parts of its range, and although that practice still continues in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland and the Faroe Islands, the bird faces few other natural or man-made threats. Since its population is growing, the International Union for Conservation of Nature considers it a least-concern species. Because it is both a conspicuous and a common bird, it is referred to in several ancient myths and legends. The Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner gave the northern gannet the name Anser bassanus or scoticus in the 16th century, and noted that the Scots called it a solendguse. The former name was also used by the English naturalist Francis Willughby in the 17th century; the species was known to him from a colony in the Firth of Forth and from a stray bird that was found near Coleshill, Warwickshire. It was one of the many species originally described by the Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, where it was given the binomial name Pelecanus bassanus. The French biologist Brisson placed it in the genus Sula in 1760, and his compatriot Louis Pierre Vieillot moved the species to his new genus Morus in 1816. Morus is derived from Ancient Greek moros, meaning ""foolish"", and refers to the lack of fear shown by breeding gannets and boobies, which enables them to be easily killed. The specific name bassanus is from the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth. The ornithologist Bryan Nelson in 1978 supported the species' inclusion in Sula as he felt the differences in anatomy, behaviour, ecology and morphology between gannets and boobies were not sufficient to warrant separate genera. Charles Lucian Bonaparte described the American populations as Sula americana in 1838, though the basis for distinguishing them from the European species was unclear and the name is now considered to be a synonym. ""Northern gannet"" has been designated as the official common name for the species by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC). It is also known as the North Atlantic gannet. Gannet is derived from Old English ganot, meaning ""strong or masculine"", which is ultimately from the same Old Germanic root as gander. Soland goose and similar old names for the northern gannet such as solan or solan goose derive from a hypothetical Scottish Gaelic sulan, itself borrowed from the Old Norse sula. The literal meaning is ""cleft stick"", referring to the appearance of the conspicuous crossed black wing tips on a perched northern gannet. Old regional names such as Norfolk's ""herring gant"" or Yorkshire's ""mackerel gant"" refer to typical fish prey. Lincolnshire's gaunt, although derived from the same Germanic root, usually applies to the great crested grebe, but the English writer Richard Hakluyt used the term in 1600 to refer to the gannet, ""a great White foule"". Young birds have been called ""spotted booby"" or ""parliament goose"", the former term referring to their plumage. The feeding habits of the gannet have led to its name being used as slang for a gluttonous person, a usage first recorded in 1929. The Sulidae, the gannets and boobies, appeared about 30 million years ago. Early Sulidae fossils resembled the boobies, although they were more aquatic, the gannets splitting off later, about 16 million years ago. The gannets evolved in the northern hemisphere, later colonising the southern oceans. The most ancient extant species may be the Abbott's booby, possibly the sole survivor of an otherwise extinct separate lineage. A 2011 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA suggests that the ancestor of the gannets arose around 2.5 million years ago before splitting into northern and southern lineages. The latter then split into the Cape and Australasian gannets around 0.5 million years ago. The three gannets are generally considered to be separate species forming a superspecies, though they have also formerly been classified as subspecies of Sula bassanus. An adult northern gannet has a 170–180cm (67–71in) wingspan, and is 87–100cm (34+1⁄2–39+1⁄2in) long and weighs 2.3–3.6kg (5–8lb), making it the largest gannet and the largest seabird native to the western Palearctic. The two sexes are generally of a similar size and appearance. The plumage is white with dark brown to black wing tips; the primary flight feathers, primary coverts and alulae are dark. The head and neck are tinged buff-yellow, becoming much more prominent in the breeding season. Males are more deeply coloured than females. The eyes are surrounded by black bare skin and have a cobalt blue orbital ring, the iris is light blue-grey with a fine dark outer ring. In birds that survive avian influenza, the irises become black. The beak is long, strong and conical with a slight downcurve at the end and a sharp cutting edge. In adults, the beak is blue-grey with dark grey or black edges. There is a black groove running the length of the mandible that merges into the skin around the eyes. A black band of bare skin also separates the pale feathers of the forehead and throat from the bill, which gives the gannet its distinctive face markings. The four-toed feet are joined by a membrane that can vary in colour from dark grey to dark brown. There are coloured lines running along the toes that continue along up the legs. These are typically greenish-yellow in males and bluish in females and probably have a role in mating. Fledglings are dark grey to slate-grey with upperparts and wings finely speckled with white. There is a prominent V-shaped white area under the rump. The wing tips and tail are dark brown-black, partly tipped with white. The bill and iris are dark brown. They can weigh more than 4kg (9lb) by the time they leave the nest at about 10 weeks of age. In the second year, the bird's appearance changes depending on the different phases of moulting: they can have adult plumage at the front and continue to be brown at the rear. Gannets gradually acquire more white in subsequent seasons until they reach maturity after five years. Northern gannets are slightly larger and thicker-billed than Cape or Australian gannets. The northern gannet has more white in the wings and an all-white tail, the other species having black tips to their tail feathers. Individuals on the west coast of Africa could be confused with vagrant masked boobies, though the latter is smaller overall, lacks the buff tinge to the head, and has a black tail. From a distance, or in poor visibility, albatrosses can be confused with northern gannets, particularly those with immature plumage that have more black on the wings. Northern gannets have streamlined bodies adapted for plunge-diving at high speed, including powerful neck muscles, and a spongy bone plate at the base of the bill. The nostrils are inside the bill and can be closed to prevent water entry; the eyes are protected by strong nictitating membranes. There are subcutaneous air sacs in the lower body and along the sides. Other air sacs are located between the sternum and the pectoral muscles and between the ribs and the intercostal muscles. These sacs are connected to the lungs and are filled with air when the bird breathes in. The air can be returned to the lungs by muscle contractions. The feathers are waterproof, which allows the birds to spend long periods in water. A water-impermeable secretion produced by a sebaceous gland covers the feathers and the birds spread it across their body using their beak or head. Individuals have a subcutaneous fat layer, dense down feathers and tightly overlapping feathers that help them withstand low temperatures. A reduced blood flow in the webbing on their feet outside of the breeding season also helps to maintain body temperature when the birds swim. The northern gannet is a loud and vocal bird, particularly in the colony. Its typical call is a harsh arrah-arrah or urrah-urrah, which is emitted upon arriving or when challenging other gannets at the colony. The call is shortened to a rah rah when fishing or collecting nesting material, and lengthened to a ooo-ah when taking off. The calls of the sexes are similar. According to Nelson northern gannets can recognize the call of their breeding partner, their chicks and birds in neighbouring nests. Individuals from outside this sphere are treated with more aggression. The northern gannet's breeding range is on both sides of the North Atlantic on coasts influenced by the Gulf Stream, There are colonies in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and on the islands off the east coast of Canada. They normally nest in large colonies, on cliffs overlooking the ocean or on small rocky islands. The water needs to be cool enough for Atlantic mackerel and herring, which are the main food source for the northern gannet. These areas also overlie the continental shelf. Northern gannet colonies can be found in the far north in regions that are very cold and stormy, and Nelson has suggested that they can survive in these regions for several reasons, including the combination of body weight and a powerful beak that allows them to capture strong muscular fish, and the ability to dive to great depths and capture prey far from the cliffs. Their fat reserves act as weight when diving and as reserves during extended periods without food. The northern limit of their breeding area depends on the presence of waters that are free of sea ice during the breeding season. Therefore, while Greenland and Svalbard offer suitable breeding sites, the Arctic regions have summers that are too short to allow the northern gannets to lay their eggs and raise a brood, which requires between 26 and 30 weeks. The southern limit of their distribution mainly depends on the presence of sufficient prey. There is fossil evidence of northern gannets breeding on Crete in the Pleistocene. Some northern gannet breeding colonies have been recorded as being located in the same place for hundreds of years. The cliffs containing the colonies appear white when seen from a distance, due to the number of nesting birds present on them. There is a written record of a colony on the island of Lundy from 1274. There were only 70 nests by 1871, and the colony finally disappeared by 1909 at the latest. More than two-thirds of the world population breeds around the coasts of the British Isles. Colonies include: After the breeding season, adult northern gannets disperse over a wide area although they travel no more than 800 to 1,600km (450 to 850nmi) from the breeding colony. It is not known if all birds from one colony migrate to the same over-wintering area. Many adults migrate to the west of the Mediterranean, passing over the Strait of Gibraltar and flying over land as little as possible. Other birds follow Africa's Atlantic coastline to arrive in the Gulf of Guinea. Immature northern gannets from colonies in Canada fly to the Gulf of Mexico, much further south than the adults. The immature gannets migrate southwards for great distances and have been recorded as far south as Ecuador. In their second year some birds return to the colony they were born in, where they arrive later than the mature birds. They then migrate south again at the end of the breeding season, but travel shorter distances in this second migration. Gannets from Alderney have been tracked since 2015 to gain better knowledge of their movements. One individual was found to have travelled from its colony in Alderney to Scandinavian waters, a round trip of around 2,700km (1,500nmi). The species has been recorded as a vagrant in many central and eastern European countries as far south and west as the Black Sea, and also in Bermuda, Cuba, Cyprus, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Jan Mayen and Syria. In February 2016, one was recorded from Ceará in northeastern Brazil—the first sighting in the Southern Hemisphere. The wings of the northern gannet are long and narrow and are positioned towards the front of the body, allowing efficient use of air currents when flying. Even in calm weather they can attain velocities of between 55 and 65kmh (30 and 35kn) although their flying muscles are relatively small: in other birds flying muscles make up around 20% of total weight, while in northern gannets the flying muscles are less than 13%. Despite their speed, they cannot manoeuvre in flight as well as other seabirds. Northern gannets need to warm up before flying. They also walk with difficulty and this means that they have problems getting airborne from a flat area. They take off from water by facing into the wind and strongly beating their wings. In light winds and high waves they are sometimes unable to take off and they can become beached. Northern gannets alight on land using angled wings, fanned tail and raised feet to control their speed, not always successfully, since damaged or broken wings were recorded as a frequent cause of death in adults at one colony. Northern gannets forage for food during the day, generally by diving at high speed into the sea. They search for food both near to their nesting sites but also further out to sea. Birds that are feeding young have been recorded searching for food up to 320km (170nmi) from their nest. It has been found that 2% of birds nesting in the colony on Bass Rock search for fish at Dogger Bank, between 280 and 320km (150 and 170nmi) away. It is likely that they fly further than this while foraging, possibly up to double the distance; normally they fly less than 150km (80nmi). Some studies have found that the duration and direction of flights made while foraging for food are similar for both sexes, although there are significant differences in the search behaviour of males and females. Female northern gannets are not only more selective than males in choosing a search area: they also make longer and deeper dives and spend more time floating on the surface than males. Gannets will follow fishing boats or cetaceans to find discarded or injured fish. They forage from heights of up to 70m (230ft) with no clear preference, and typically dive between 11 and 60m (35 and 195ft). They dive with their bodies straight and rigid, wings tucked close to the body but angled back, extending beyond the tail, before piercing the water like an arrow. They control the direction of the dive using their wings and tail, and fold their wings against the body just before impact. Birds can hit the water at speeds of up to 100kmh (30ms). This allows them to penetrate up to 11m (36ft) below the surface, and they will swim down to an average 19.7m (60ft), sometimes deeper than 25m (80ft). The bird's subcutaneous air sacs may have a role in controlling their buoyancy. Gannets usually push their prey deeper into the water and capture it as they return to the surface. When a dive is successful, they swallow the fish underwater before surfacing, and never fly with the fish in their bill. Larger fish are swallowed headfirst, smaller fish are swallowed sideways or tail-first. The fish is stored in a branched bag in the throat and does not cause drag when in flight. Their white colour helps other gannets to identify one of their kind and they can deduce the presence of a shoal of fish by this diving behaviour; this in turn facilitates group foraging, which makes capturing their prey easier. The colour also makes the gannet less visible to the fish underneath. Northern gannets also forage for fish while swimming with their head under water. They eat mainly fish 2.5–30.5cm (1–12in) in length that shoal near the surface. Virtually any small fish (roughly 80–90% of their diet) or other small pelagic species (largely squid) will be taken opportunistically. Sardines, anchovies, haddock, smelt, Atlantic cod and other shoal-forming species are also eaten. M. bassanus takes huge quantities from the waters around Newfoundland for the energy requirements of their growing chicks. Given the economic importance of the prey taken, whether they are in competition with human fishing industry in the area is an important question which remains unassessed. (But given the small amount taken, NL's cod take is probably unaffected.) On the other hand, they profit off of discarded bycatch and processed parts and the reduction in competition if humans are taking predatory fish. M. bassanus inflicts significant wastage on the northwest Atlantic Salmo salar fishery, but does not actually eat much of them. This makes it difficult to resolve this conflict with the fishing industry in the area, as the only option would be to exterminate the birds, which is ecologically unacceptable. The oldest birds are the first to return to the northern gannet's breeding colonies. Birds not of breeding age arrive a few weeks later. In general, birds first return to a colony (not uncommonly the one in which they were hatched) when they are two or three years old. Once an individual has successfully bred in a colony it will not normally change to another. Nesting starts in March or April. Immature birds stay on the edges of the colony. They may even make a nest but they do not breed until they are 4 or 5 years old. Some birds of this age occupy empty nests that they will aggressively defend if they have sat on them for two or three days. If an apparently empty nest has an owner, the immature bird will leave without a struggle when the owner arrives to take possession. The preferred nesting sites are on coastal hillsides or cliffs. If these are not available northern gannets will nest in groups on islands or flat surfaces. As they find it more difficult to take off from such locations they will often cross the area occupied by an adjacent nest causing an aggressive reaction from the sitting pair; this means that the stress levels are higher in this type of colony than in those on steeper surfaces. Notwithstanding this, nests are always built close together and otherwise ideal nesting sites will not be used if they are some distance from a colony. On average there are 2.3 nests per square metre (1.9 per square yard). Both sexes fiercely defend the area around their nest. Where space allows, the distance between nests is double the reach of an individual. Nests are made from seaweed, plants, earth and debris from the sea. The males usually collect the materials. Nests are compact cups typically 30–60cm (12–24in) in height. The area which a nest occupies grows throughout the breeding season as the breeding pairs throw their excrement outside the nest. Over years, nests can reach 2m (6+1⁄2ft) in height. Northern gannets lay one egg that on average weighs 104.5g (3+5⁄8oz), which is light for such a large seabird. The egg is around 79mm (3+1⁄8in) long by 50mm (2in) wide and the shell is pale blue and translucent initially before fading to a chalky white surface that is easily stained. M. bassanus was among those birds most affected by the shell-thinning effect of DDT, which contributed in large degree to its ban. Where two eggs are found in a nest this is the result of two females laying an egg in the same nest or one egg being stolen from another nest. Northern gannets will lay a replacement egg if the first is lost. Incubation takes 42 to 46 days, during which time the egg is surrounded by the brooding bird's warm, webbed feet. Just before hatching begins, the brooding bird releases the egg from its feet to prevent the egg from breaking under the adult's weight as the chick breaks it open. This is a frequent cause of death for chicks of birds that are breeding for the first time. The process of breaking the eggshell can take up to 36 hours. The webbed feet are also used to cover the chicks, which are only rarely left alone by their parents. Chicks that are left unattended are often attacked and killed by other northern gannets. Newly hatched chicks are featherless and are dark blue or black in colour. In the second week of life they are covered in white down, replaced over the next five weeks by dark brown feathers flecked with white. Young chicks are fed regurgitated semi-digested fish by their parents, who open their mouths wide for their young to fetch the food from the back of their throats. Older chicks receive whole fish. Unlike the chicks of other species, northern gannet chicks do not move about the nest or flap their wings to ask for food: this reduces the likelihood that they will fall from the nest. The adults feed their offspring for around 13weeks, right up until the time they leave. The young birds fledge between 84 and 97 days old, departing by launching themselves off a cliff and flying—a procedure for which it is impossible to practice beforehand. If they leave the nest in bad weather they can be mortally wounded as they can be blown against the rocks. The young birds are attacked by adults if unattended. Once they leave the nest they stay at sea learning to fish and fly, their flight skills being too poor for them to return to the breeding ledges. Northern gannets have only one brood a year. The survival rate for young birds for their first four years is 30% and the annual survival rate for adults is 91.9%. The typical lifespan after becoming adult is 17 years, and the maximum known age is 37 years 4 months 16 days. Gannet pairs are monogamous and may remain together over several seasons, if not for all of their lives. The pairs separate when their chicks leave the nest but they bond again the following year. Should one of the pair die, the other bird will find another mate. Northern gannets exhibit many types of aggressive behaviour while they are nesting. Confrontations normally only take place between birds of the same sex. Females will lower their heads before an aggressive male that is defending its nest: this will expose the back of the female's neck and the male will take it in its beak and expel the female from the nest. A female will not react if a male approaches a nest but it will react fiercely if another female approaches. The fights between males occupying nests for the first time are particularly intense. Such fights can last for up to two hours and lead to serious injuries. Birds lunge at each other and lock bills, wrestling for extended periods while neighbours peck at them. The fights are preceded by threatening gestures, which are also seen outside the breeding season. Males demonstrate ownership of a nest by gesturing towards their neighbours in a bowing display; their heads and beaks point down, and their wings are held up and away from the body, yet folded backwards. The male moves his head from side to side before bowing forwards. Males try to attract an available female after establishing a territory. The females will fly over the colony several times before landing. Their posture, with the neck stretched out, tells the male that they are available for courtship. The male will then shake their heads in a similar way to when they are guarding their nest, but with their wings closed. Mated pairs engage in a fencing display when the male arrives back at the nest. The two birds stand breast to breast with wings spread and bills extended vertically. They fence and scissor with their bills rapidly, calling loudly at the same time. Fencing is interspersed with bill bowing. The northern gannet is not heavily predated. The only known habitual natural predators of adults are bald eagles, white-tailed eagles and golden eagles. Predators of eggs and nestlings include the great black-backed gull and American herring gull, common ravens, ermine, and red fox. Attacks at sea are insignificant, though large sharks and seals may rarely snatch a gannet out at sea. Kleptoparasitism by skuas, particularly the great skua, occurs at breeding sites. The skua chases its victim until it disgorges its stomach contents, providing a meal for the attacker. Skuas may catch the tip of the gannet's wing, causing it to fall into the sea, or seize the tail to tip its victim into the water. The gannet is only released when it has regurgitated its catch. External parasites include feather lice, although there are relatively few species and none are found on the head. As with grebes and divers, it may be that the short head feathers provide insufficient cover for the parasite. In one species, Michaelichus bassani, immature lice are found in the membranes lining the subcutaneous air-cells. Ixodes mites include the widespread I. uriae. The spiny-headed worm Corynosoma tunitae appears to occur only in gannets and closely related seabird families such as the cormorants. The tapeworm Tetrabothrius bassani absorbs toxic heavy metals at a higher concentration than the gannet's own tissues, with an average 12 times as much cadmium as the gannet's pectoral muscles and 7–10 times the lead level of the bird's kidney and liver. Since levels of these toxic metals are detectable in the parasite earlier than in the host, the tapeworm might be used as an early indicator of marine pollution. A 2004 survey counted 45 gannet breeding colonies and some 361,000 nests. The population is apparently growing between 3% and 5% a year, although this growth is concentrated in just a few colonies. Although northern gannet populations are now stable, their numbers were once greatly reduced due to loss of habitat, removal of eggs and killing of adults for their meat and feathers. In 1939, there were 22 colonies and some 83,000 nests, which means that the populations have increased fourfold since that time. In 1992, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimated the bird's population to be some 526,000. After taking into account an estimate produced for BirdLife International in 2004 of the European population, the IUCN revised its global population to between 950,000 and 1,200,000 individuals. The IUCN lists northern gannets as a species of least concern, as they are widely distributed and as there is a large population that appears to be growing due to high breeding success, with 75% of eggs producing fledged young. In Homer's Odyssey, the sea goddess Leucothea (Greek: Λευκοθέα ""white goddess""), appears ""in the likeness of a Gannet"" and tells the shipwrecked Odysseus to discard his cloak and raft, instead offering him her veil to wind round himself which will save his life and enable him to reach land. Another early reference to the gannet is in the 7th-century Old English epic poem The Seafarer. There I heard naught but seething sea, Ice-cold wave, awhile a song of swan Then came to charm me gannets' pother And whimbrels trills for laughter of men, Kittiwake singing instead of mead. An old myth from Mykines in the Faroe Islands tells of the giant Tórur seeking mercy following defeat at the hands of Óli, the islanders' head man and magician. In return, he gave them whales, driftwood logs and a bird unique to the archipelago, on condition that the inhabitants did not laugh at his gifts. Over time, the islanders forgot their promise, and lost the whales and logs, but fearful of losing a valuable food source, they never mocked the gannets that Tórur had given them. Northern gannets have long been eaten for food. Birds, mainly the young, were taken from Bass Rock for at least 350 years until 1885, when the annual cull of about 1,500 individuals finally ceased, and Shetland gannets were sold as ""Highland goose"" in London restaurants during World War II. Views of the palatability of this bird are mixed, but as well as being a food for the poor it also regularly featured in Scottish royal banquets. In Scotland gannets were traditionally salted to preserve them until they got to market, this technique being replaced by partially cooking or smoking in the era of modern transport. They are normally served roasted, although sometimes raw when pickled or dried. The best-known site was the remote island of St. Kilda, where adults and eggs were taken in the spring. The fat chicks, known locally as ""gugas"", were harvested from the precipitous cliffs in August, just before they could fly, and thrown to waiting boats far below. Much of the meat was salted in barrels for storage, but the rest of the bird was also used. Islanders paid their rent in feathers for stuffing pillows and furniture, the gannet stomachs were used to hold oil derived from the carcasses, and the breastbones served as lamp wicks. Hunting on St. Kilda ceased in 1910, but the gannetry on Sula Sgeir is still exploited under a licence that permits 2,200 chicks to be taken each year. During the hunt, 10 men live on the island, and the cleaned birds are singed on a fire fuelled by their own oil-rich offal. The filleted birds are then taken to Stornoway, where each hunter receives 200 skins to give away or sell. The continuing existence of the practice of hunting and eating gannets attracts criticism in some quarters. The island's name ""Sula Sgeir"" itself derives from sula, meaning ""gannet"", and the Old Norse skerr, a skerry. Other sites that continued hunting into the 20th century were Eldey in Iceland, where the activity ceased in 1939, and Mykines, where small-scale culling still persists. About 500 young are culled for consumption each year in Mykines, using techniques similar to those of the Sula Sgeir hunts. Although the Bass Rock population fell to fewer than 4,000 pairs in the early 19th century, the population soon recovered once hunting ceased, and St. Kilda was harvested sustainably for hundreds of years. Elsewhere, the recovery was less complete. The Bird Rocks colony in the Gulf of St Lawrence may once have held 250,000 birds, but unchecked hunting, including for fish bait, meant that the population was only 1,000 birds by 1932, despite government protection since 1904.",Normal
"The Chiapas catfish, Lacantunia enigmatica, is an unusual species of catfish (order Siluriformes) from the Usumacinta River basin in the Mexican state of Chiapas and in Guatemala. It was scientifically described in 2005 and placed in its own family Lacantuniidae. While discovery of an undescribed species of catfish is not uncommon, discovery of a new family of any vertebrate group is a rare event. The Chiapas catfish mainly feeds on crabs, prawns, small fish, and large, tough plant seeds. This catfish is commonly fished in its natural habitat, where it is known as madre de juil, which means ""mother of Rhamdia"" (a common fish in the area). It first came to the attention of scientists in 1996, when Rócio Rodiles-Hernández, a Mexican ichthyologist conducting a biotic survey on the river, collected the first specimens from the Chiapas-Guatemala border. Unable to identify the species, Rodiles involved two American catfish specialists, Dean A. Hendrickson of the University of Texas at Austin and John G. Lundberg of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. A detailed comparative morphological study employing high-resolution, three-dimensional CT-scan imagery of the fish's anatomy revealed a number of distinctive characteristics unique to this species and the absence of characters needed to place this fish in any existing catfish family. In a 2005 publication, these three ichthyologists, with Julian M. Humphries of the University of Texas, described this fish as a new species, genus and family of catfish. This fish is not related to any of the families found in its range (Ariidae, Ictaluridae, or Heptapteridae). It is most similar to Ictaluridae, but lacks some important characteristics to classify this fish into this family or the other two families. Initial study has placed this fish above Diplomystidae, Cetopsidae, and Hypsidoridae, but further classification is unknown. This family probably represents a basal group in which intermediates have disappeared. With recent molecular evidence, Lacantunia has been shown to be the sister group to Claroteidae, an African catfish family. It probably diverged from the claroteids in the Late Cretaceous between 75 and 90million years ago. The generic name of the fish reflects its distribution in the Lacantún River drainage, flowing through the Montes Azules and Selva Lacandona Biosphere Reserves in Chiapas, Mexico into the Usumacinta River. After its initial discovery in the Lacantún, it was found to also inhabit other parts of the Usumacinta River basin, extending its range into northwestern Guatemala. With the description of the new family, four catfish families are now found in this region. These fish inhabit deep river channels and pools, often but not always with rocks and strong eddy currents. Few specimens were taken in stream mouths. Key variations that differentiate this genus from all other families are the shape of the animal's skull, jaw muscles, and gas bladder — which fish use to rise and sink in water. The gas bladder has paired diverticulae, while other catfish families either have no diverticulae or singular diverticulae. Some external characteristics that may help distinguish this fish include nostrils set far apart, the presences of nasal barbels, maxillary barbels placed above the lip distantly from the corner of the mouth, and a rounded caudal fin. This fish has four pairs of barbels. The maximum length of this species reaches 42.7 centimetres (16.8in) SL. It is depressed (flattened) near the head and compressed (thin) near the tail. The head is blunt and rounded, and the mouth is usually not subterminal (down-turned). The adipose fin is large and thick. This fish has dorsal and pectoral fin spines.",Normal

"Jeff Fillion (born Jean-François Fillion), is a radio host and businessman in Quebec, Canada. He is often associated with a politically incorrect radio style known as trash radio (Radio poubelle) that is often associated with right-wing radio hosts from the Quebec City area. Fillion began his career in his home town of Chicoutimi in the late 1980s working for CFIX-FM. Most of his reputation comes from his stint, from 1997 to 2005, as morning man with radio station CHOI-FM in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. He developed over time a strong following, and at his peak, had more than twice as many listeners as his nearest competitor. However, his very controversial and politically incorrect comments, combined with those of André Arthur, resulted in the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) refusing to renew the station's licence in July 2004. The station and license were bought by RNC Media in June 2007 without interruption to its broadcasting. He was fired on March 17, 2005, in the fallout of the trial from Sophie Chiasson against him and his then-employer. The judgement was particularly severe, with the judge noting that the comments made by Jeff Fillion regarding Miss Chiasson were ""sexist, mean, incited hatred, were without cause, wounding and injurious. These comments are a threat to the dignity and honour of human kind in general and particularly to Miss Chiasson."". The participants in the radio show (Fillion and gang) referred to the plaintiff as ""a consummate liar,"" ""a cat in heat,"" as well as ""a leech on (hockey player) Alexandre Daigle,"" ""an airhead"" and repeatedly suggested Chiasson used sex to get jobs.  Miss Chiasson was awarded $340,000 CAD in punitive damages. . After numerous rumours to the effect that he would be hired by other radio stations in the Quebec City market (which turned out to be unfounded) or by a satellite radio group, he announced his intention of launching a subscription-only Internet radio service. RadioPirate.com was launched on March 17, 2006, exactly a year after he was fired by CHOI-FM. His radio show was also broadcast on XM Satellite Radio, channel 156 until his contract was nullified on August 11, 2011 by the newly merged Sirius XM Canada. His internet station still lives today and a free light version is also available. Fillion was hired by Bell Media and was back on the air beginning March 3, 2014 with his show:""Jeff Fillion"" on NRJ 98.9, a Quebec city radio station. On April 19, 2016, Fillion was suspended indefinitely by Bell Media for a tweet that he posted about an interview that Alexandre Taillefer had given to Guy A. Lepage on the French Canadian show ""Tout le monde en parle (Quebec)"". The tweet linked to an article which summarized the interview. The only other content of the tweet was two identical emoji faces which Fillion included, seemingly because they resemble Taillefer. Fillion's tweet was interpreted by his opponents as trying to ridicule Taillefer who was blaming the company Amazon.com for the suicide of his son. Although he rapidly deleted his tweet, Fillion was suspended by Bell Media after Taillefer, while being interviewed by Paul Arcand, publicly questioned the fact that Bell Media was still employing him. On April 20, 2016, Bell Media announced that Fillion was not an employee anymore. His politics are a mix of conservatism and libertarianism. He rejects separatism not for any real attachment to Canada but more because of his perception that sovereignty would only help to increase socialism in Quebec. His father, Gilbert Fillion, was a one-term Member of Parliament for the Bloc Québécois, in the riding of Chicoutimi from 1993 to 1997. He is an avid critic of the way media treat global warming. He recognizes the presence of global warming but suggests that human action has little to do with it. Fillion is an amateur of popular economics, wishing to improve the basic level of economics knowledge of Quebecers. He was an avid critic of the mayor Andrée Boucher who, he believes, kept the city in a state of dust. He believes that NHL hockey should come back to Quebec City, notably by an ownership effort from Red Bull. He proposes that a new arena should be built in a public-private partnership, a project similar to what led Winnipeg to build the new MTS Centre. Jeff Fillion claims that a new breed of Quebec politicians should regroup, notably identifying leaders such as ex cabinet member Joseph Facal, economist Nathalie Elgrably, radiologist Gaetan Barrette and political reporter Michel Hébert. In October 2009, Fillion announced he would run against current Quebec City mayor, Regis Labaume. His program consists of getting new infrastructures for the city and better spending ethics. He placed second against incumbent mayor, Regis Labeaume, with 8.6% of the votes cast.",Normal
"David J. Cooper is a Professor of Accounting at the University of Alberta, Canada. He is the co-founder, along with Anthony Tinker, of the academic journal Critical Perspectives on Accounting and is also a long-time associate editor of Accounting, Organizations and Society. He is best known as a central figure and co-founder of the critical accounting and public interest accounting movements: movements which emphasize the importance of not only studying the roles of accounting in organizations and society but also using this knowledge to intervene in the public sphere. Cooper was born in London, England. He completed his undergraduate studies at the London School of Economics in 1970 and his PhD at the University of Manchester in 1980. In the early 1990s, he moved from the United Kingdom to Canada, eventually accepting a research chair at the University of Alberta. He has continued to lecture widely and has held visiting positions at Oxford University, the London School of Economics and the University of Edinburgh. Cooper has pushed our understanding of three aspects of accounting practice. First, his research on the political economy of accounting during the 1980s, helped to incite a vibrant research tradition on the role of accounting numbers in social struggle. Political economy of accounting approaches acknowledge that accounting numbers both selectively re-present social reality and act as a distributional mechanism for allocating societal resources. These insights have been taken up and used to study a variety of public interest accounting topics such as environmental reporting as well as class and gender-based aspects of financial reporting. Second, Cooper’s research on the accounting profession has illuminated the intersections among public accounting firm practices, the organization of the accounting profession, and the associated societal-level consequences. This stream of research draws upon the sociology of the professions literature, extending this literature to show how the accounting profession is similar yet different from other professions such as medicine and law. The research also traces how globalization has impacted on the organization and activities of public accounting. Third, Cooper has theorized and practiced the role of the specific, public intellectual. Building on the insights of Foucault and Bourdieu, Cooper showed the importance of using accounting expertise to intervene in the public sphere. The interventions included the United Kingdom Coal Board interventions in the 1980s as well as the debtdeficit interventions and privatization interventions in Canada in the 1990s. More recently, Cooper has served as a board member and resident accounting expert for the Parkland Institute, a Canadian-based public think-tank. Cooper has supervised andor acted as mentor to a group of prominent accounting academics. These include Keith Robson (editor-in-chief of Accounting, Organizations and Society), Vaughan Radcliffe (who has studied public secrets within governmental accounting), Dean Neu (another public interest accounting researcher), and Daniel Martinez (who studies NGO accountability).",Normal

"The 2022 Alaska state elections took place on November 8, 2022. The state also held Regional Educational Attendance Area (REAA) elections on the first Tuesday in October. Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski was originally appointed to the Senate in 2002, winning subsequent elections in 2004, 2010, and 2016. Under Alaska's recently adopted election system, the state conducted a nonpartisan blanket primary. Murkowski finished first (with 45.05% of the vote), ahead of Republican Kelly Tshibaka (38.55%), Democrat Pat Chesbro (6.82%), and Republican Buzz Kelly (2.13%). Murkowski, Tshibaka, Chesbro, and Kelly all advanced to the ranked-choice general election. In the first round of tabulation in the general election, Murkowski finished first (with 43.37% of the vote); Tshibaka finished in a close second (42.60%). Chesbro received 10.37% of the vote, while Buzz Kelly received 2.89%. Murkowski won the election with 53.70% of the vote in the third round of tabulation. Incumbent Republican representative Don Young died on March 18, 2022, after serving as representative for 49 years. A special election was held on August 16 to fill the rest of his term, resulting in Democrat Mary Peltola beating Republicans Sarah Palin and Nick Begich using the state's newly implemented ranked-choice voting system. Peltola ran for election to a full-term, again against Palin and Begich. Republican Tara Sweeney originally placed fourth in the nonpartisan blanket primary, but withdrew. She was replaced by Libertarian Chris Bye, who finished the primary in fifth place. In the first round of general election voting, Peltola came in first with 48.77% of the vote to Palin's 25.74%, Begich's 23.33%, and Bye's 1.73%. In the third round, Peltola won the election with 54.96% of the vote. Incumbent Republican governor Mike Dunleavy was originally elected to the position in 2018 with 51.4% of the vote. He ran for re-election in 2022. In Alaska's nonpartisan blanket primary, Dunleavy and his running mate, former commissioner of the Alaska Department of Corrections Nancy Dahlstrom, finished first with 40.43% of the vote. Former Democratic state representative Les Gara and Jessica Cook came in second place, with 23.06% of the vote; independent former Alaska governor Bill Walker and Heidi Drygas finished in third place with 22.77% of the vote. Dunleavy and Dahlstrom won the general election in the first round of ranked-choice voting with 50.29% of the vote. 19 of the state's 20 senate seats were up for election in 2022, with some elected for two-year terms and other for four-year terms due to redistricting. The Republican party lost two seats, while the Democratic party gained two seats for an eleven to nine seat split respectively. A bipartisan coalition of eight Republicans and nine Democrats was announced, electing Gary Stevens as Senate President. All 40 seats of the Alaska House of Representatives were up in this election. Since 2016, the house has been governed by a coalition of democrats, independents, and some republicans. The coalition was re-elected to a majority, albeit with only 20 of the total 40 seats in the chamber, with 6 independents and 1 Republican joining all 13 Democrats. Republican Cathy Tilton was elected speaker, replacing Republican Louise Stutes. Ballot Measure 1 asked Alaskans whether a constitutional convention should be held, a vote that appears on ballots every ten years.

"Holstebro is the main town in Holstebro Municipality, Denmark. The town, bisected by Storåen (""The Large Creek"") and has a population of 37,022 (1 January 2023). The town arose at a ford by the creek, and later a bridge was erected. The name probably derives from holdested ved broen (lit, ""a resting place by the bridge""). Holstebro was first mentioned in a letter from Bishop Thyge of Ribe in 1274. A large fire in 1552 destroyed many of the town's old buildings. On 11 February 1962 parts of Holstebro were hit by a high-end F3T7 tornado. This was the most devastating tornado in Denmark's history & 3rd strongest. The tornado travelled 13km with a max width of 500 meters. More than 100 homes were damaged or destroyed. Large brick apartments had their roof torn off and large parts of their third storey destroyed. A concrete barn was entirely destroyed with only one to two exterior walls still standing, and a mobile home was tossed into the air. Damage cost reached 14 million DKK as of 1962, or about 188.9 mil dkk as of 2022  On 10 August 1975, Holstebro recorded a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Denmark. The town is a trading, industrial and cultural center in western Jutland. Industries include the manufacture of processed food, iron and machinery, wood and furniture, textiles and chemicals. Holstebro has a large network of pedestrian walkways (gågader) in the town centre either side of the River Storå. This area has a varied shopping environment, enhanced by outdoor sculptures and picturesque buildings, including the town church and the Town Hall. The first sculpture purchased by Holstebro Municipality was Alberto Giacometti's sculpture ""Maren on vehicle"" purchased in 1966. Holstebro has a rich and varied cultural life. Between 1997 and 2009 it hosted the internationally recognized ballet company Peter Schaufuss Ballet and the town still hosts the performance art theatre Odin Teatret.

"Since being founded in 1819, Colgate University has had a rich tradition of student societies. Literary societies, Greek letter fraternities and sororities, non-Greek letter organizations, honor societies, and secret societies have all played a part in Colgate history. Social fraternities came to Colgate in 1850 when Alpha Delta Phi was granted a chapter. The first sorority was brought to Colgate in 1982 when a chapter of Gamma Phi Beta (Gamma Phi) received a charter. Secret or underground organizations have had a widespread existence at Colgate University. Many of the school's original societies had roots as underground organizations. In terms of secret honor societies, Colgate has also had its fair share. Two secret Honor Societies, the Gorgon's Head and Skull and Scroll, enjoyed a period as rival societies until 1934 when they merged to form Konosioni, now known as the Tredecim Senior Honor Society.

"Zbigniew Hubert Cybulski (Polish pronunciation: ; 3 November 1927 – 8 January 1967) was a Polish film and theatre actor, one of the best-known and most popular personalities of the post-World War II history of Poland. He is known for portraying young rebels in such films as Night Train and Innocent Sorcerers. His role in Andrzej Wajda's 1958 drama film Ashes and Diamonds is widely considered to be his greatest artistic achievement. His iconic image symbolizing youthful rebellion and his tragic death have drawn comparisons to American actor James Dean. Zbigniew Cybulski was born 3 November 1927 in a small village of Kniaże near Śniatyń, Poland (now a part of Kolomyia Raion, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine). After World War II he joined the Theatre Academy in Kraków. He graduated in 1953 and moved to Gdańsk, where he made his stage debut in Leon Schiller's Wybrzeże Theatre. Also, with his friend Bogumił Kobiela, Cybulski founded a famous student theatre, the Bim-Bom. In the early 1960s, Cybulski moved to Warsaw, where he shortly joined the Kabaret Wagabunda. He also appeared on stage at the Ateneum Theatre, one of the most modern and least conservative Warsaw-based theatres of the epoch. However, Cybulski is best remembered as a screen actor. He first appeared in a 1954 film Kariera as an extra. In 1955, he made his film debut in Andrzej Wajda’s first full-feature film A Generation. His first major role came in 1958, when he played in Kazimierz Kutz's Krzyż Walecznych. The same year he also appeared as one of the main characters in Andrzej Wajda's Ashes and Diamonds and Aleksander Ford's The Eighth Day of the Week based on a short story by Marek Hłasko. From then on Cybulski was seen as one of the most notable actors of the Polish Film School and one of the ""young and wrathful"", as his generation of actors were called at the time. His most famous films, apart from Ashes and Diamonds, include Wojciech Has' The Saragossa Manuscript. He also acted in numerous television plays, including some based on works by Truman Capote, Anton Chekhov and Jerzy Andrzejewski. Cybulski died in an accident at a Wrocław Główny railway station on 8 January 1967, on his way from the film set. As he jumped on the speeding train (as he often did), he slipped on the steps, fell under the train, and was run over. He was buried in Katowice. Cybulski remains a legend of the Polish cinema. His style of acting was revolutionary at the time, as was his image (leather clothes and big sunglasses). He was often referred to as ""the Polish James Dean"". Like Dean, he played nonconformist rebels, and like him he died young. In 1969, the Zbigniew Cybulski Award (Polish: Nagroda im. Zbyszka Cybulskiego) for young film actors with strong individuality was introduced. The Polish band 2 Plus 1 recorded a tribute album to Cybulski, called Aktor in 1977. In 1996, readers of Film magazine awarded him the title of Best Polish Actor of All Time. In 2009, he won a similar poll by the readers of Newsweek Polska.",Normal

"The tram network in Olsztyn, Poland, is operated by the city-owned Olsztyn Municipal Transport Company (Polish: Miejskie Przedsiębiorstwo Komunikacyjne Olsztyn) Sp. z o.o. The system contains three lines, with an additional two under construction along a single route. The network operates 27 trams, acquired in two orders of 15 and 12, respectively. The rolling stock was manufactured by the Polish company Solaris Bus & Coach and the Turkish company Durmazlar. The current tram system began construction in September 2012 and revenue service in December 2015. A separate tram system operated from 1907 to 1965, when it was replaced by bus service. The new Olsztyn tram network is one of two networks built in Poland after World War II (the other being the Częstochowa tram network, opened in 1959) and the only one to be rebuilt after being dismantled, although its routes do not follow those of the pre-1965 network. Trams in Olsztyn (then Allenstein, East Prussia, German Empire) first ran in December 1907. The network was entirely single track, 1,000mm (3ft3+3⁄8in) metre gauge, and powered by 600 V DC overhead lines. It consisted of two routes: route 1 connecting Olsztyn Główny railway station with Plac Roosevelta (then Hauptbahnhof–Remontemarkt) through Old Town and Wysoka Brama (then Hohes Tor) and route 2 connecting 1 Maja with Jakubowo (along Wojska Polskiego near the Forest Stadium, then Guttstädter Straße–Jakobsberg, Waldstadion). A depot and a traction substation powering the tram network was located on this route not far from the railway line, and another depot was built near the Jakubowo terminus. In 1930, the network was extended. Route 1's terminus was moved from Olsztyn Zachodni to Jeziorna (then Jahnweg) on the shore of Długie Lake (then Lang See). At the same time, the track between Jagiełły and Dworzec Zachodni was lifted. In 1940, trolleybus route 2 was inaugurated leading to the discontinuation of tram route 2. From then until 1945, only route number 1 remained in operation. In March 1945, the front closed on the city and all public transport was suspended. The system suffered extensive damage as a result of the fighting. As part of the Yalta agreement, the southern part of East Prussia became part of Poland. The network and rolling stock needed extensive renovation, but trams on route 1 resumed operation on 30 April 1946 and on route 2 on 28 June 1946. There were no more changes to the network until the end of operation. The trams last ran on 20 November 1965. The system was closed down because it required major investment that the city could not afford and bus transport was a more economical solution. In 2004, the city authorities started considering building a completely new light rail network. The project was approved in 2009 and, after bids by five companies, the construction contract was awarded to the Spanish firm FCC Construcción on 27 June 2011, for approximately 250million Polish złoty (€60.7million). Construction started in September 2012 and was scheduled to be completed in June 2014. The system was opened in stages between 19 and 31 December 2015. A new line to Pieczewo is under construction. Work on the line started in July 2021 and it is scheduled to be completed in January 2024. The depot is being expanded to have the capacity for 16 additional trams. Several projects are planned for Olsztyn's tram network: The standard gauge network connects the main railway station with the south of the city, with branches to the edge of Old Town and the University. The network is mostly double-tracked, with the branch to Uniwersytet-Prawocheńskiego and a short stretch near the Wysoka Brama being single tracks. There are no balloon loops and all vehicles are bi-directional. Most of the network runs along separate right of way but all intersections are level crossings. Intersections with major roads are controlled by traffic lights. The intelligent transport system affords priority to trams. There are 19 stations on the tram network along its total length of 11km (6.8mi). Trams operate at intervals of 7 and 10 minutes on weekdays, and of 10 to 15 minutes on weekends. Three lines operate on the network, with lines 4 and 5 under construction and scheduled to open in October 2023. All three lines overlap for portions of their lengths. The Olsztyn tram network operates 27 trams. The first set of fifteen was manufactured by Solaris Bus & Coach of Poland, while the second set of twelve was manufactured in Turkey by Durmazlar. All vehicles are fully accessible, are air-conditioned, and are equipped with ticket vending machines and free WiFi. 53°46′51″N 20°30′32″E﻿ ﻿53.7807°N 20.509°E﻿ 53.7807; 20.509",Normal

"Mountain Dwellings (Danish: Bjerget) is a building in the Ørestad district of Copenhagen, Denmark, consisting of apartments above a multi-story car park. The building was designed by the Danish architectural practice PLOT (BIG+JDSA). The apartments scale the diagonally sloping roof of the parking garage, from street level to 11th floor, creating an artificial, south facing 'mountainside'. Each apartment has a ""backyard"" on the roof of the property in front and below it. The resulting courtyard penthouses are an attempt to balance ""the splendours of the suburban backyard with the intensity of an urban lifestyle"". Throughout the building, it plays on a mountain metaphor as well as the clash between the urban vibe of the interior parking space as well as the surroundings and the peaceful and organic hillside. The parking garage contains parking spots for 480 cars. The space has up to 16 m high ceilings, and the underside of each level of apartments is covered in aluminum painted in a distinctive colour scheme of psychedelic hues which, as a tribute to Danish 1960s and '70s furniture designer Verner Panton, are all exact matches of the colours he used in his designs. The colours move, symbolically, from green for the earth over yellow, orange, dark orange, hot pink, purple to bright blue for the sky. Besides being a sloping podium for the residential units to sit on, maximizing sunlight and views, the central garage space also serves as an atrium containing the building's circulation, affording the only access to the apartments. A set of metal stairs climb through the main space over the parking lot, providing access to the hallways across suspended industrial-looking metal-clad concrete connections, while a Swiss-manufactured, ski lift-style inclined elevator moves along the wall of the garage. Each level's hallway is enclosed and encased in painted metal both on the interior and exterior, colored according to floor in the same hues used in the main space. The sloping roof is covered with a single layer of 80 penthouses. Each apartment has an L-shaped floor plan and a terrace and small garden outside, located on the roof of the in-front, lower-level apartment. The design is inspired by suburban rowhouses developments. The L-shape floor plan in combination with a small courtyard was inspired by Jørn Utzon's Kingo Houses north of Copenhagen. The facades of the apartments towards the gardens are clad in untreated wood to increase the organic and calm feel of the setting. The northern and western facades of the parking garage depict a 3,000 m² photorealistic mural of Himalayan peaks. The parking garage is protected from wind and rain by huge shiny aluminium plates, perforated to let in light and allow for natural ventilation. By controlling the size of the holes, the sheeting was transformed into the giant rasterized image of Mount Everest. The picture is based on a photo commissioned from a Japanese Himalaya photographer, though it had to be stretched to fit the proportions of the site. The interior walls of the car park are decorated with a series of murals by the French street artist Victor Ash, depicting scenes of wildlife such as moose and wolves standing atop 'automobile mountains' of wrecked cars. The roof gardens are edged by elevated flowerbeds in the shape of planter railings, designed to block the view to neighbouring, lower-level apartments. They are planted according to a coordinated scheme of plants, which will make the colours and the appearance of the mountain slope change according to the changing seasons. The building has an extensive watering system which collects rainwater and uses it for automatically watering the roof gardens during dry periods. For special occasions, the urban space of the parking garage is used for events and parties, such as the closing party of Copenhagen Distortion in 2008. A public staircase on the outside allows the general public to ""climb"" the mountain, and a local mountain climbers’ association will soon install a climbing wall at the back of the building, near the peak. Mountain Dwellings is featured in the parkour documentary ""My Playground"". 55°38.115′N 12°34.975′E﻿ ﻿55.635250°N 12.582917°E﻿ 55.635250; 12.582917",Normal

"Teúl de González Ortega Municipality (Spanish:  ⓘ) is a town and municipality located in the south of the Mexican state of Zacatecas, between the state capital of Zacatecas and the city of Guadalajara. Unlike most of the rest of the state, its economy has been based on agriculture and livestock, rather than mining, and it is noted for its production of agave and mezcal. The town has been named a Pueblo Mágico to promote a tourism industry. The municipality extends over 886km2, and borders the municipalities of Tepechitlán, Mezquital del Oro, Garcia de la Cadena and Florencia de Benito Juárez with the state of Jalisco to the south and the state of Nayarit to the west. Outside the seat, other important communities include Ignacio Allende with 1,800 residents, Huitzila with 800 and www.milpillas.com with 500. In addition there are sixteen other communities with representation in the municipal government. The municipality has mountains, small mesas, plain and rolling hills with an average altitude of 1940 meters above sea level. The Cerro de Teul is marked by a large cross. The area is part of the Lerma River basin. The municipal seat is at the juncture of two small rivers called the Rio Grande and La Aticuata. Together they form the Tlaltenango River. After joining other rivers to the Lerma, the area drains into the Pacific. Another important river in the area is the Patitos. The municipality contains one dam called the Manuel Caloca with a capacity of 5,000,000 m3 and another called the Ignacio Allende with a capacity of 1,000,000m3. The rest of the municipality has an abundance of fresh water springs which provide most of the potable water. The climate is between semi warm and temperate with an average annual precipitation of between 750 and 800mm with most rain falling in the summer, especially July. The north is drier than the south. The coldest months are December and January with lows down to 11C with occasional freezing. The warmest months are May and June with highs up to 40C. Much of the area is forested with species such as oak, holm oak, royal pine and “palo colorado”. Fauna includes coyotes, wildcats, white-tailed deer, squirrels, rabbits, various spiders and scorpions, rattlesnakes, coral snakes, and other snakes, eagles, quail, owls, storks, ducks and various other birds. The name Teúl comes from the Chichimeca phrase teulinchan, which means “dwellings of the gods.” After the Conquest, its name became San Juan Bautista de Teúl, prepending the name of its patron saint. In 1935, the suffix of “de Gonzaléz Ortega” was added. Jesús González Ortega, a governor of Zacatecas and ally of Benito Juárez, lived in the town as a boy, then returned later in life to marry. Little is known of the early inhabitants of the area, but settlements probably go back as far as the first century of the Common Era, according to archeological evidence such as tombs. The Caxcans arrived here around the middle of the 7th century, taking control of the valley from the Nahuas and the Techueshes. They remained the dominant group until the arrival of the Spanish. In 1536 Nuño de Guzmán sent Pedro Almíndez Chirino to the area then followed himself shortly after. Within months the indigenous of the area were conquered and Captain Juan Delgado along with Frair Juan Pacheco founded the modern town. At that pre-Hispanic ceremonial center the friar held a mass in honor of John the Baptist, who became the town’s patron saint. One probable reason for the selection of this saint by the Spanish was the area’s abundance of fresh water springs. At this mass, they baptized the area chieftain and a sister, giving them the names of Juan and Catalina. In 1574, a monastery was founded here. Unlike other small towns in Zacatecas, it was never a mining town, with its economy based on livestock and the making of mezcal from agave. During the colonial period into the 19th century, much of the agriculture was organized into haciendas, but these were dismantled with the Mexican Revolution and the Cristero War, when the town itself was nearly burnt to the ground. The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Guadalupe was the original parish church constructed in the late 17th century. The town was formally recognized in 1714 by the Real Audiencia de la Nueva Galicia. At the time of Independence, Teul was a dependency of Tlaltenango, but was separated into its own municipality in 1844. This status was reaffirmed in 1935. In 1986, the municipality adopted a seal on the occasion of the 450th anniversary of the town’s founding. The economy of the municipality is based on agriculture and livestock. Eighty eight percent of the farmland is worked only during the rainy season, with the rest irrigated. The main crop is corn, followed by beans then sorghum and fava beans. Livestock is mostly cattle followed by pigs. Another important crop is agave, which is used to make mezcal. This liquor is still made by hand, using wood barrels and pits to roast the agave hearts. The municipality has seven registered distilleries making mezcal including El Caxcán, Don Aurelio Lamas and Zacatecano. In addition to the straight mezcal, cream variations in flavors such as strawberry, piña colada, coconut, nut and coffee are produced. The area remains relatively poor, with many families having one or more members living in the United States to work. The state and municipality have worked to develop a tourism industry for Teúl as well, including its naming as a Pueblo Mágico. This rural area maintains many of its traditional religious and secular celebrations, mostly related to local saints. Unlike many places in Mexico, the streets are clear of street vendors, so street food is generally available only during festivals. Local specialties include gordita de horno, a sweet case baked on an oak leaf, and gorditas de arriero, a savory dish filled with refried beans flavored with chile de arbol. Other popular dishes include pipian rojo, tamales with meat and nopal, tortitas de guachal (made with nopales and eggs), and chuales, a kind of baked tamale with beans and piloncillo and birria. Handcrafts include wooden masks, most often used for a traditional dance called Los Morenos in honor of the Holy Cross. Another craft is ceramics, which include pots, plates, storage jars and ladles. They are made with a sand colored clay and glazed.",Normal

"97 Bowery is a five-story loft building on the Bowery between Hester and Grand Streets in the Lower East Side and Chinatown neighborhoods of Manhattan, New York City. The building was designed by Peter L.P. Tostevin in the Italianate style, and was built in 1869 for John P. Jube & Co., which occupied it until 1935. The building has a cast-iron facade from the J. B. & W. W. Cornell Iron Works, the details of which were most likely chosen from a catalog. As such, it is typical of cast-iron construction in the 1850s and 1860s. At the time it was built, the Bowery was the primary commercial street of the Lower East Side. Today, the building is a rare cast-iron survivor in the area, as well as a reminder of the importance of the Bowery as a commercial center after the Civil War. 97 Bowery was designated a New York City Landmark by the New York City Landmark Preservation Commission on September 14, 2010. 40°43′03″N 73°59′42″W﻿ ﻿40.717362°N 73.995134°W﻿ 40.717362; -73.995134 This article about a building or structure in Manhattan is a stub.

"Harry Hibbs (September 11, 1942– December 21, 1989) was Newfoundland's best-known icon for traditional Newfoundland music. He was born Henry Thomas Joseph Hibbs, September 11, 1942, on Bell Island, Dominion of Newfoundland. He was educated at St. Kevin's High School, Wabana, and moved with his family to Toronto shortly after the death of his father. There, Harry worked at various manufacturing facilities such as an auto parts factory, printing plant, and a munitions factory. At one of these plants he suffered a career changing accident that prevented him from any strenuous work; this led Harry to take up performing music. He had learned this skill from his father, who was an accomplished fiddle player and also played accordion. In addition, His mother had taught him to sing Irish ballads. Hibbs became a member of the Caribou Show Band that played regularly to expatriate Newfoundlanders living in Toronto. Members of the band at that time were Johnny Burke on bass guitar, Norma Gale, vocals, Brian Barron, mandolin and fiddle, Roddy Lee on drums, Bob Lucier on steel guitar and Harry Hibbs on accordion. Hibbs was signed to Arc Records by Phil Anderson, president of Arc Records, and the first album released in October 1968 with signature song ""The Black Velvet Band"". In 1968 a weekly television show called At the Caribou featuring Hibbs aired on CHCH-TV in Hamilton. Hibbs appeared on many television programs such as The Tommy Hunter Show, Singalong Jubilee and Don Messer's Jubilee. Hibbs went on to record 26 albums, of which several went gold. He opened his own nightclub, the Conception Bay, in Toronto in 1978. Hibbs died in Toronto on December 21, 1989, of cancer. Steve Fruitman of CIUT-FM created the Porcupine Award in 1990 for those who deserve recognition for their work in Canadian folklore music. In 1991 the Harry Hibbs Award was inaugurated and its first recipient was Geoff Meeker. This award was eventually renamed the Harry Hibbs Award for Perseverance. In 1993 Harry Hibbs was inducted into the Porcupine Hall of Fame.

"Daryll Neita (born 29 August 1996) is a British sprinter. In 2022, she won her first individual international medals, with bronze in the 100 metres at both the European Championships and Commonwealth Games. Neita claimed bronze for the 60 metres at the 2023 European Indoor Championships. She has won several medals as part of Great Britain 4 × 100m relay teams, including Olympic bronze medals in 2016 and 2021, World Championships silver medals in 2017 and 2019, and European gold in 2018. Her 60 metres indoor best of 7.05 seconds and 100 metres best of 10.90 seconds achieved at the 2023 ISTAF Indoor and 2022 Commonwealth Games respectively puts her second on the relevant UK all-time lists behind Dina Asher-Smith. Neita is a four-time British national champion, once outdoors over 100m, twice outdoors over 200m, and once indoors over 60m. In 2015, Neita finished fourth in the 100 metres final at the European Junior Championships with a time of 11.69 seconds. In 2016, she finished second in the event with 11.24 seconds (having run a personal best of 11.23 in the semi-finals) at the British Championships, earning Olympic selection.

"Contraception was illegal in Ireland from 1935 until 1980, when it was legalised with strong restrictions, later loosened. The ban reflected Catholic teachings on sexual morality. The encyclical Casti connubii (1930) followed the industrial production and widespread use of condoms that usually prevent fertilisation. It specified: any use whatsoever of matrimony exercised in such a way that the act is deliberately frustrated in its natural power to generate life is an offence against the law of God and of nature, and those who indulge in such are branded with the guilt of a grave sin Following the marketing of ""the pill"" in the 1960s, a Pontifical Commission on Birth Control was set up. It has often been cited that there was a majority in favour of contraception, and that is implied in the wording of the papal encyclical. The encyclical Humanae vitae (1968) decreed that artificial contraception is not morally permissible. Owning and using contraceptive devices and pills was not prohibited. However, from 1935, it was illegal to sell or to import them. During this time a loophole was used, where a device such as a condom could not be ""offered for sale"", but a citizen could be ""invited to treat"" to buy it. Also people made donations to family planning associations to obtain contraception as a ""gift"". The reality for almost all of the population was that contraception was unobtainable. Few outlets wanted to stock a product that could bring the attention of the police or public opprobrium. In early 1971 Senator Mary Robinson (who would later become president) attempted to introduce the first bill proposing to liberalise the law on contraception into the Seanad, but was not allowed a reading, so it could not be discussed. On 31 March a number of supporters managed to get into the grounds of Leinster House and then broke into the building to register their protests. On 22 May 1971 a group of Irish feminists including Mary Kenny travelled to Belfast by rail and made their return to Dublin Connolly, laden with contraceptive devices, into a statement on the illogicality of the law. This provoked criticism from the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland; Thomas Ryan, Bishop of Clonfert, said that ""... never before, and certainly not since penal times was the Catholic heritage of Ireland subjected to so many insidious onslaughts on the pretext of conscience, civil rights and women's liberation"". In 1973, the Supreme Court determined in McGee v. The Attorney General that there was a constitutional right to marital privacy which also allowed for the use of contraceptives. A number of bills were proposed, but none became law. Indeed, Taoiseach at the time, Jack Lynch, admitted at one point that the issue had been put ""on the long finger"". The Health (Family Planning) Act 1979 limited the provision of contraceptives to ""bona fide, family planning or for adequate medical reasons"". Under this scheme, contraceptives could only be dispensed by a pharmacist on the presentation of a valid medical prescription from a practising doctor. The legislation did not require that the recipient of the prescription be married; however ""bona fide family planning"" would have made non-marital use unlikely to be authorised. The legislation had been introduced by Charles Haughey. The reason for the compromise was the strong position of conservative elements in Irish society at the time, particularly the Roman Catholic Church which made it difficult for the government to provide for a more liberal law. Contraception was also not seen by politicians as a vote-getter at the time. Haughey described the 1979 Act as ""an Irish solution to an Irish problem"". Eileen Desmond, TD, was severely critical of the legislation; describing it as hypocritical, she argued that women should make their own decisions on such matters, and contended that the Irish people and ""those who have conditioned our consciences' showed greater moral concern on sexual matters than in addressing poverty"". On 1 November 1980 the Act came into operation by order of the minister. The Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act 1985 liberalised the law by allowing condoms and spermicides to be sold to people over 18 without having to present a prescription; however sale was limited to categories of places named in the Act. The Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act 1992 repealed Section 4 of the 1979 Act, as amended in 1985, and continued the provision of contraceptives without prescription, allowing sale to individuals over the age of 17. As of 2010, the 1992 Act and the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act 1993 are the main Irish legislation on contraceptive and family planning services. As well as allowing sales, Ireland's censorship laws had to be reformed to allow contraceptives to be advertised or even mentioned. As late as 1976, the Censorship of Publications Board had banned the Irish Family Planning Association's booklet ""Family Planning"". The Health (Family Planning) Act 1979 deleted references to ""the unnatural prevention of conception"" in the 1929 and 1949 censorship Acts, thus allowing publications with information about contraception to be distributed in Ireland. The Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for the Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995 modified the 1929, 1946 and 1967 Acts to allow publications with information about ""services provided outside the State for the termination of pregnancies"". As of January 2023, there are more than a dozen contraceptive choices available in Ireland including the daily pill, condoms and more long-term methods such as the coil. Contraception, contraceptive consultations, appointments, prescriptions and any other costs are now free for 17 to 26 year olds under the Government's free contraception scheme. There are medical professionals available who can guide you through your options and help you find the most appropriate method of contraception for your needs. For those who are not covered by the scheme, a contraceptive consultation costs €60 (or €45 if you are a student). The 8th Amendment to the Irish constitution which prevented abortion was repealed in 2018. A small percentage of the Irish population still opposes the use of artificial contraception within marriage, in line with Humanae Vitae, including sports personality Mickey Harte.",Normal

"The Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation is an American nonprofit organization that supports research into the causes and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The organization's mission is to ""understand the causes of Alzheimer's disease, improve the care of people living with it, and find a cure."" The Foundation is funded through donations from the public. Zachary Fisher, a New York City businessman and philanthropist, founded the organization in 1995 after his wife, Elizabeth Fisher, developed Alzheimer's disease. He teamed up with philanthropist David Rockefeller to establish the Zachary and Elizabeth M. Fisher Center for Research on Alzheimer's Disease at The Rockefeller University. Since its founding, the Fisher Center Foundation has primarily supported the research conducted at the Fisher Center Laboratory, which until 2019 was under the direction of Nobel Laureate Paul Greengard. The Foundation also publishes educational material for the public. Since 2007, the Foundation has published Preserving Your Memory magazine, a subscription-based publication for consumers. The magazine has interviewed the caregivers of high-profile individuals suffering from Alzheimer's, as well as written features about high-profile caregivers themselves. It also publishes educational features, such as on the COVID-19 pandemic. When his wife, Elizabeth Fisher, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, her husband, New York City real estate developer and philanthropist Zachary Fisher, partnered with their friend David Rockefeller to start the Zachary and Elizabeth M. Fisher Center for Research on Alzheimer's Disease at The Rockefeller University (the Fisher Center Lab) in New York City. Paul Greengard led the Fisher Center Lab as its director from its founding until his death in 2019. Since then, the lab has been led by interim Laboratory Head Marc Flajolet and advised by a Neuroscience Advisory Committee featuring multiple Nobel Laureates and faculty from The Rockefeller University. The Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization, was founded by Zachary Fisher and David Rockefeller in 1995. The Foundation raises funds via contributions from the public, with most of those funds going to support the Fisher Center Lab, although the foundation also funds other Alzheimer's research around the globe. The Fisher Center Foundation has been designated a four-star charity by Charity Navigator every year since 2010, and received a Gold Seal of Transparency from Guidestar every year since 2018. The longtime President and CEO of the Foundation was Kent Karosen, a New York City-based businessman and philanthropist. Karosen was also the co-author, along with Chana Stiefel, of Why Can't Grandma Remember My Name?, a children's book about Alzheimer's disease published by the Foundation in 2016. Karosen died in 2018. The Foundation is currently led by the chairman of the board Barry R. Sloane and Executive Director Lucretia Holden. Since its founding in 1995, the Fisher Center Foundation has financially supported the Zachary and Elizabeth M. Fisher Center for Research on Alzheimer's Disease at The Rockefeller University. In addition to their regular financial support, in 2017 the Foundation established the Paul Greengard Professorship at Rockefeller University, in honor of longtime Fisher Center director and Nobel Laureate Paul Greengard. In 2021, the Foundation announced the endowment of another professorship at Rockefeller University, to be named the Zachary and Elizabeth M. Fisher Professorship in Alzheimer's and Neurodegenerative Disease. Since 2021, the Professorship has been held by Professor Sidney Strickland. Since 2007, the Foundation has published Preserving Your Memory, a triannual magazine available to subscribers and distributed to medical professionals nationally. The magazine is also made available for free on the Foundation website. The magazine has interviewed the caregivers of high-profile individuals suffering from Alzheimer's, as well as written features about high-profile caregivers themselves.

"Obsidian Kingdom is a music band formed in 2005 in Barcelona, whose music is not easy to label. The band itself defines it as “hard-to-classify heavy sound with plenty of contrasts”. The band's music has been characterized as drawing equally on progressive rock, post-metal, black metal, alternative and electronic music. In 2013, Metal Injection called them ""the masters of every genre"". The band was originally formed by guitar player Rider G Omega and drummer Croma LAN Ro in Barcelona. Guitar player Prozoid Zeta JSI and bass player Fatal Error Pl:An joined the band later in 2005, and the line-up was completed in 2006 with singer Saten Haz Im Nu. Their first work was the MCD Matter (2007), the reviews of which were overall good while highlighting production as a weak point. During the subsequent year after Matter’s release, Obsidian Kingdom toured Spain and Portugal. Their following release, the EP 3:11, was recorded during 2009 and out in 2010, serving as a preview to what should have been their first album: Fera. The band entrusted Ritxi Ostáriz (Ulver, Ihsahn) with the artwork design. On this occasion, reviews underlined the band's evolution in sound and composition, as well as the great amount of influences and different styles that could be heard in their music. Right before the release of 3:11, the band's line-up suffered drastic changes, with the departures of Nu, Ro, and Pl(a)n, but by 2011 the lineup had stabilized with the addition of keyboard player Zer0 Æmeour Íggdrasil, drummer Ojete Mordaza II, and bass player Fleast Race O’Uden. Obsidian Kingdom promoted 3:11 with this new setup during 2011, through a few local shows. In November 2012 Obsidian Kingdom released the LP Mantiis, a concept album consisting of a single song divided into 14 tracks, which is defined by reflecting a diverse palette of emotions and the great amount of genres that it contains. The album, that includes guest appearances by Fiar (singer from the Catalan black metal band Foscor) and trumpeter Nicholas Dominic Talvola, obtained very positive reviews from specialized press. Once more, design was in charge of Ritxi Ostáriz, who posed this time as Art Director, while creative responsibilities relied on visual artist Elena Gallen. Mantiis was officially presented live on December 14, 2012, at Music Hall in Barcelona with Cut the End as supporting band. The album was played in its entirety and the band finished the concert with a cover of the traditional American folk song Wayfaring Stranger. Late live appearances during 2013 include the support of Cult of Luna during their January shows in Madrid and Barcelona, and their performance in April at Headway Festival. In November 2013, the band released Torn & Burnt, which contains seven remixes from Mantiis signed by electronic producers such as DJ Oktopus from Dälek, Subheim, Poordream, Necro Deathmort, Jr Morgue, Drumcorps, Larvae and Mothboy. In April 2014 Obsidian Kingdom is signed to the independent music label Season of Mist. Following the re-issue of Mantiis on October 24, the band embarked on a tour across Europe and the UK, headlined by the Icelandic post-rock band Sólstafir. Obsidian Kingdom's performance throughout the tour received praiseworthy reviews from the media, which highlighted the band's presence, energy and intensity onstage. Mantiis was played live in its entirety for the last time at Ritual Cvlt Fest in October 2014. The band ended their performance with a cover of the Necro Deathmort Remix of their track ""Awake Until Dawn"". In June 2015, Obsidian Kingdom played a special show with their Drone Set side-project at the Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona. Shortly thereafter, the band announced a new line-up (with two new members Seerborn Ape Tot on guitars and Om Rex Orale on bass) and the recording of their new album in the Fall of 2015 with the London-based Colombian producer Jaime Gomez Arellano (Ulver, Paradise Lost). A Year With No Summer was released by Season of Mist on March 11, 2016 with the songs ""AwayAbsent"", ""Black Swan"" and ""Darkness"" as singles. A mockumentary was released for ""Black Swan"", directed by the Catalan documentary filmmaker Silvia Subirós. The album received several favorable ratings from music critics, that underlined the bold change in style from the band's debut (especially in the vocal register), its thematic depth and the decrement of extreme metal resources in favor of a more accessible sound. It features the guest appearances of Kristoffer Rygg in ""10th April"" and Attila Csihar in ""The Kandinsky Group"" and the artwork design is once more credited to Ritxi Ostáriz and Elena Gallen. In May 2016, the band announced a new line-up change with the incorporation of young guitar player Eaten Roll I and former guitar player Seerborn Ape Tot now playing keyboards after the departure of Zer0 Æmeour Íggdrasil. In Spring 2016 a few presentation shows were held in different cities of Spain, along with the band's performance at Be Prog and Resurrection festivals in July 2016. The album was then promoted in a full-blown European and UK tour in September 2016 with Shining and Intronaut. To commemorate the first anniversary of the record, the band performed electronic covers of its songs at the Error! Design Art Gallery on March 11, 2017, along with some others from Radiohead, Led Zeppelin and Lou Reed. In June 2018, Obsidian Kingdom received a commission from the Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona to write an original score for the classic silent film The Phantom Carriage, to be performed as the opening for the Gandules'18 ""Illuminated cinema: Magic, altered states and the occult"" open air cinema cycle, which was part of an exhibition dedicated to the occult called ""La Llum Negra"" (The Black Light). The score was written by producer and long-time collaborator Jorge Mur, and was performed on the evening of 7 August 2018 before a full patio. In December 2019, the band performed two new songs for the first time at the Madrid is the Dark Fest, displaying another line-up change: Jade Riot Cul on the keyboards and Eaten Roll I no longer on guitar. MEAT MACHINE was released worldwide by Season of Mist on September 25, 2020. Two videos were released as singles: ""MEAT STAR"" was directed by Spanish filmmakers Ferran Ureña and Eric Morales and received the ""Best International Music Video"" award at the 2020 edition of the Santiago Horror Film Festival in Santiago de Chile, and ""THE PUMP"" featured an animated piece produced by Ukrainian artist Jakov Burov. The release was met with critical acclaim and most journalists highlighted the band's ability to remain inclassificable while pushing the limits of the metal genre. The album was noted for its variety, unpredictability and frantic creativity, and was declared the ""Best National Metal Record of 2020"" by Spanish music magazine Mondo Sonoro. In September 2020, Obsidian Kingdom was featured on the cover of the Spanish edition of Metal Hammer magazine. In December 2020, MEAT MACHINE was first presented live at the ninth edition of AMFest in Barcelona. The band has announced a European tour in May 2021 in support of Enslaved.",Normal
"Glutamine synthetase (GS) (EC 6.3.1.2) is an enzyme that plays an essential role in the metabolism of nitrogen by catalyzing the condensation of glutamate and ammonia to form glutamine: Glutamate + ATP + NH3 → Glutamine + ADP + phosphate Glutamine synthetase uses ammonia produced by nitrate reduction, amino acid degradation, and photorespiration. The amide group of glutamate is a nitrogen source for the synthesis of glutamine pathway metabolites. Other reactions may take place via GS. Competition between ammonium ion and water, their binding affinities, and the concentration of ammonium ion, influences glutamine synthesis and glutamine hydrolysis. Glutamine is formed if an ammonium ion attacks the acyl-phosphate intermediate, while glutamate is remade if water attacks the intermediate. Ammonium ion binds more strongly than water to GS due to electrostatic forces between a cation and a negatively charged pocket. Another possible reaction is upon NH2OH binding to GS, rather than NH4+, yields γ-glutamylhydroxamate. Glutamine synthetase can be composed of 8, 10, or 12 identical subunits separated into two face-to-face rings. Bacterial GS are dodecamers with 12 active sites between each monomer. Each active site creates a ‘tunnel’ which is the site of three distinct substrate binding sites: nucleotide, ammonium ion, and amino acid. ATP binds to the top of the bifunnel that opens to the external surface of GS. Glutamate binds at the bottom of the active site. The middle of the bifunnel contains two sites in which divalent cations bind (Mn+2 or Mg+2). One cation binding site is involved in phosphoryl transfer of ATP to glutamate, while the second stabilizes active GS and helps with the binding of glutamate. Hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions hold the two rings of GS together. Each subunit possesses a C-terminus and an N-terminus in its sequence. The C-terminus (helical thong) stabilizes the GS structure by inserting into the hydrophobic region of the subunit across in the other ring. The N-terminus is exposed to the solvent. In addition, the central channel is formed via six four-stranded β-sheets composed of anti-parallel loops from the twelve subunits. GS catalyzes the ATP-dependent condensation of glutamate with ammonia to yield glutamine. The hydrolysis of ATP drives the first step of a two-part, concerted mechanism. ATP phosphorylates glutamate to form ADP and an acyl-phosphate intermediate, γ-glutamyl phosphate, which reacts with ammonia, forming glutamine and inorganic phosphate. ADP and Pi do not dissociate until ammonia binds and glutamine is released. ATP binds first to the top of the active site near a cation binding site, while glutamate binds near the second cation binding site at the bottom of the active site. The presence of ADP causes a conformational shift in GS that stabilizes the γ-glutamyl phosphate moiety. Ammonium binds strongly to GS only if the acyl-phosphate intermediate is present. Ammonium, rather than ammonia, binds to GS because the binding site is polar and exposed to solvent. In the second step, deprotonation of ammonium allows ammonia to attack the intermediate from its nearby site to form glutamine. Phosphate leaves through the top of the active site, while glutamine leaves through the bottom (between two rings). GS is present predominantly in the brain, kidneys, and liver. GS in the brain participates in the metabolic regulation of glutamate, the detoxification of brain ammonia, the assimilation of ammonia, recyclization of neurotransmitters, and termination of neurotransmitter signals. GS, in the brain, is found primarily in astrocytes. Astrocytes protect neurons against excitotoxicity by taking up excess ammonia and glutamate. In hyperammonemic environments (high levels of ammonia), astroglial swelling occurs. Different perspectives have approached the problem of astroglial swelling. One study shows that morphological changes occur that increase GS expression in glutamatergic areas or other adaptations that alleviates high levels of glutamate and ammonia. Another perspective is that astrocyte swelling is due to glutamine accumulation. To prevent increased levels of cortical glutamate and cortical water content, a study has been conducted to prevent GS activity in rats by the use of MSO. There seem to be three different classes of GS: Plants have two or more isozymes of GSII, one of the isozymes is translocated into the chloroplast. Another form is cytosolic. The cytosolic GS gene translation is regulated by its 5' untranslated region (UTR), while its 3' UTR plays role in transcript turnover. While the three classes of GSs are clearly structurally related, the sequence similarities are not so extensive. GS is subject to reversible covalent modification. Tyr397 of all 12 subunits can undergo adenylylation or deadenylylation by adenylyl transferase (AT), a bifunctional regulatory enzyme. Adenylylation is a post-translational modification involving the covalent attachment of AMP to a protein side chain. Each adenylylation requires an ATP and complete inhibition of GS requires 12 ATP. Deadenylylation by AT involves phosphorolytic removal of the Tyr-linked adenylyl groups as ADP. AT activity is influenced by the regulatory protein that is associated with it: PII, a 44-kD trimer. PII also undergoes post-translational modification by uridylyl transferase, thus PII has two forms. The state of PII dictates the activity of adenylyl transferase. If PII is not uridylylated, then it will take on the PIIA form. The AT:PIIA complex will deactivate GS by adenylylation. If PII is uridylylated, then it will take on the PIID form. The AT:PIID complex will activate GS by deadenylylation. The AT:PIIA and AT:PIID complexes are allosterically regulated in a reciprocal fashion by α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and glutamine (Gln). Gln will activate AT:PIIA activity and inhibits AT:PIID, leading to adenylylation and subsequent deactivation of GS. Furthermore, Gln favors the conversion of PIID to PIIA. The effects of α-KG on the complexes are opposite. In the majority of gram-negative bacteria, GS can be modified by adenylylation (some cyanobacteria and green algae or exceptions). Inhibition of GS has largely focused on amino site ligands. Other inhibitors are the result of glutamine metabolism: tryptophan, histidine, carbamoyl phosphate, glucosamine-6-phosphate, cytidine triphosphate (CTP), and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Other inhibitorsregulators are glycine and alanine. Alanine, glycine, and serine bind to the glutamate substrate site. GDP, AMP, ADP bind to the ATP site. L-serine, L-alanine, and glycine bind to the site for L-glutamate in unadenylated GS. The four amino acids bind to the site by their common atoms, “the main chain” of amino acids. Glutamate is another product of glutamine metabolism; however, glutamate is a substrate for GS inhibiting it to act as a regulator to GS.2 Each inhibitor can reduce the activity of the enzyme; once all final glutamine metabolites are bound to GS, the activity of GS is almost completely inhibited. Many inhibitory input signals allows for fine tuning of GS by reflecting nitrogen levels in the organism. Feedback regulation distinguishes the difference between two eukaryotic types of GS: brain and non-brain tissues. Non-brain GS responds to end-product feedback inhibition, while brain GS does not. High concentrations of glutamine-dependent metabolites should inhibit GS activity, while low concentrations should activate GS activity. Inhibitors: Research on E. coli revealed that GS is regulated through gene expression. The gene that encodes the GS subunit is designated glnA. Transcription of glnA is dependent on NRI (a specific transcriptional enhancer). Active transcription occurs if NRI is in its phosphorylated form, designated NRI-P. Phosphorylation of NRI is catalyzed by NRII, a protein kinase. If NRII is complexed with PIIA then it will function as a phosphatase and NRI-P is converted back to NRI. In this case, transcription of glnA ceases. GS is subject to completely different regulatory mechanisms in cyanobacteria. Instead of the common NtrC-NtrB two component system, cyanobacteria harbour the transcriptional regulator NtcA which is restricted to this clade and controls expression of GS and a multitude of genes involved in Nitrogen metabolism. Moreover, GS in Cyanobacteria is not covalently modified to raise sensitivity for feedback inhibition. Instead, GS in Cyanobacteria is inhibited by small proteins, termed GS inactivating factors (IFs) whose transcription is negatively regulated by NtcA. These inactivating factors are furthermore regulated by different Non-coding RNAs: The sRNA NsiR4 interacts with the 5'UTR of the mRNA of the GS inactivating factor IF7 (gifA mRNA) and reduces its expression. NsiR4 expression is under positive control of the nitrogen control transcription factor NtcA. In addition, expression of the GS inactivating factor IF17 is controlled by a glutamine-binding riboswitch.

"Martin is an American television sitcom that aired for five seasons on Fox from August 27, 1992 to May 1, 1997. The show starred comedian Martin Lawrence as the titular character. Lawrence also played several other characters. Martin was one of Fox's highest rated shows during the sitcom's run. Martin has frequently been regarded as one of the most influential and ""pivotal"" for sitcoms of all time. Martin Lawrence plays the role of Martin Payne, a disc jockey who lives with his girlfriend Gina Waters (Tisha Campbell) in the city of Detroit, Michigan. Martin works for the fictional radio station WZUP and later, for local Public-access television station Channel 51, and the show covers events in their lives. A recurring theme in the series is Martin's selfish and free-spirited nature. His sharp tongue and lack of a filter often lead to comedic situations and conflicts with those around him, adding to the entertainment value of the show. In early episodes, Lawrence began with a monologue of him speaking directly to the camera and audience from the darkened radio studio. The only actor to appear in every episode as the same character is Thomas Mikal Ford as Tommy. As the series progressed, Martin eventually transitioned to become the host of the talk show ""Word on the Street,"" which aired on the small Detroit public-access television station Channel 51. He retained this position until the series' final episode, in which he and Gina prepare to move to Los Angeles. Gina's best friend Pam, whom Mr. Whitaker let go two episodes earlier due to downsizing, goes on to pursue a career in the music industry as an artists & repertoire (A&R) executive at Keep It Real Records. This plot line became the subject of a backdoor pilot episode Goin' for Mine (episode 129), that was included in the Martin series for a spin-off sitcom of the same name, starring Tichina Arnold, but the sitcom never materialized. Martin Payne (Martin Lawrence) Martin, the title character, is a caring family man deep down, but on the outside a very macho, selfish smart aleck. Martin carries himself in a typical urban youth manner, with modern expressions and mannerisms. His girlfriend turned wife, Gina Waters, has sometimes tried to change him (much to his anger, seeing as he likes the way he acts), but this rarely worked. Martin is not much of a physical fighter despite trying to come off as such. He has a particularly antagonistic relationship with Gina's best friend Pam. Gina Waters-Payne (Tisha Campbell), Martin's professional, fun-loving, eternally romantic and forgiving girlfriend and later wife. She often acts as a peacemaker, admonishing others when they trade barbs and insults and breaking up fights. Gina works for a public-relations firm. She complements Martin's street savvy by serving as a voice of reason. She is also Pam's best friend. Cole Brown (Carl Anthony Payne II), Martin's other best friend. Dimwitted but well-meaning and known for his eclectic taste in headgear, Cole proudly cleans jets at the airport for a living, drives an AMC Pacer, and lives with his mother Maddie until early Season Five. For a time in Season 3, Cole appeared to be attracted strictly to plus-sized women and dated a security guard named Big Shirley (who is fully seen in only one episode; another episode only showed ""her"" below the neck to portray her as being much taller and bigger than Cole). In the final season, after Cole meets Shanise and moves into his own apartment in a rough neighborhood, he dates Shanise, who appears to be even more dimwitted than he is. During the series finale, he becomes engaged to Shanise. Thomas ""Tommy"" Strawn (Thomas Mikal Ford), one of Martin's best friends. Level-headed, intelligent, and charming, Tommy serves as another voice of reason, especially during Martin's schemes. He would often portray himself as a ladies' man and would flirt with Pam and other women on the show. He had a romantic relationship with Pam during the third and fourth seasons. His mysterious employment status was a running gag on the show, with everyone saying, ""You ain't got no job!"". Of all the male characters, he is the only one to have attended college. He is also the only character to appear physically in every episode. Pamela ""Pam"" James (Tichina Arnold), Gina's sassy and ill-tempered co-worker, best friend and Tommy's girlfriend. Before eventually dating Tommy, Pam was always looking for a good man. In Season 1, Cole expressed interest in Pam, but she didn't reciprocate the interest. Pam worked at the PR firm where she was employed as Gina's assistant. She has a very adversarial relationship with Martin, responding to his insults with belittling remarks about his short stature. Pam also showcases her beautiful singing voice throughout the show. Shawn McDermott (Jon Gries) (seasons 1–2), the scatterbrained radio station engineer at WZUP. Martin always finds himself having rather strange conversations with him. Shawn often does things that upset their boss Stan, and once even tried to secure a record deal from Snoop Dogg when he was at an engagement party for Martin & Gina. It is revealed in the Season 2 Finale (Shawn's final appearance) that when Stan sold WZUP he was retained by the new station as an engineer, explaining to Martin that WEHA fired all the former WZUP DJs in favor of automated machines and that all he does is go into the station every 8 hours to switch out the radio tapes in the machines. In this episode, Shawn reveals a wiser and more serious side as he imparts valuable life advice to Martin, encouraging him to ""find out where he needs to be."" Martin takes this advice seriously and begins a journey of self-discovery, ultimately leading to his role as the host of a talk show. Following this episode, Shawn is never seen or mentioned again, except for a Season 4 clip show, ""The Best of Martin,"" where he appears via archive footage. Stan Winters (Garrett Morris) (seasons 1–2; guest season 3), Martin and Shawn's boss, the owner and founder of radio station WZUP. He perpetually used too much cologne and wore woefully outdated clothing from the 1970s. In the episode ""The Hoedown in Motown,"" Stan, Martin's cheap and untrustworthy acquaintance, is notably absent due to Garrett Morris' real-life shooting, which led to changes in the storyline. In this episode, Stan faces financial troubles, prompting the sale of the radio station. Stan makes a brief return in Season 3, partnering with Martin to open a restaurant called ""Marty Mart's Meatloaf and Waffles,"" which turns out to be a failure. Following this episode, Stan is never seen or mentioned again. Garrett Morris filmed a scene on his hospital bed, explaining his character's actions and calling in from the hospital to inform Martin about selling WZUP to settle with the IRS. Bruh-Man (Brother Man) (Reginald Ballard) (seasons 2–4): Martin's neighbor, who debuts in season two. He lives on the fifth ""flo"" (yet he always puts four fingers up when relating this fact), directly upstairs from Martin. Whenever Martin asks what he is doing, Bruh-Man replies, ""Nuttin'…just chillin'."" Bruh-Man is a character known for his peculiar behaviors, including entering Martin's apartment via the fire escape and borrowing items without permission. Despite initially annoying Martin, he becomes accustomed to Bruh-Man's presence. Bruh-Man has a distinctive walk, described as a slow and lazy, limping plod, with his head cocked to one side, referred to by Martin as his ""slow bop."" Bruh-Man typically wears ill-fitting clothing, often a size or two too small, frequently borrowed from Martin. Bruh-Man speaks in a deep voice and with a long drawl, like that of Shaquille O'Neal. Despite being a popular character, Bruh-Man was quietly phased out of the series after season three. His last appearances were in the fourth season, and he explains his absence by stating that he only comes around when Martin and Gina are away out of respect for their marriage. This is proven true as he is absent throughout the fifth and final season of the series, however he is mentioned once albeit briefly. In episode 13, ""Ain't That About a Ditch"", when Gina's mother locks Martin out of his apartment, he pauses to think, then whispers ""Bruh-Man"" to himself as he walks off to climb in through the fire escape, then Martin shows up in his apartment. Hustle Man (Tracy Morgan) (seasons 3–5): The neighborhood purveyor of questionable products and services ""at a discount rate! I don't do dat for err'body! I'm just tryna help YOU out!"" He always greets Martin with his trademark ""What's happenin', chief?"" In one episode, one of Hustle Man's more outrageous items for sale was an 'appetizing' array of roasted pigeons impaled on a tree branch (as if barbecued on it), which he attempted to sell to Martin and his friends while they were snowed in and starving. In another episode he served as Martin's cut-rate ""wedding planner"", armed with a shopping cart brimming with plastic flowers, chitlin loaf, and a 40-ounce bottle of malt liquor—Martin's retaliation for Gina's choice of a more elegant and ridiculously overpriced wedding planner. Ms. Geri (Jeri Gray): She was a tough, trigger-happy senior who, regardless of her age and diminutive size, has no qualms about ""whooping' ass"". Most of her assaults are committed on Martin in everyday situations, such as standing in line at the DMV or at the unemployment office. On one occasion, her opponent was Dragonfly Jones (Lawrence), whom she soundly defeated as well, taking his money for good measure. Shanise McGillicuddy (Maura McDade) (season 5) is Cole's girlfriend (and later fiancée), during the fifth and final season. Shanise is a very friendly woman. She always has a positive attitude. However, she is even more dimwitted than Cole. She and Cole briefly break up in one episode, but this occurs because when she told Cole she needed more space, he assumed she meant she wanted to break up, but she actually wanted a bigger apartment. She is also thoughtful and willing to help others. In the episode Over the Hoochie's Nest, she assists Martin, Tommy and Cole in rescuing Pam from an insane asylum. In the series finale, Cole wanted to ask Shanise to marry him. He had a hard time asking her due to him losing the ring. Shanise was even taken to get X-rayed in order for Cole to find the ring after he stuck it in a cupcake. Finally, they become engaged when she is tricked into reading a letter that says, ""Will you marry me?"" and Cole says yes to her. At the end of the episode, she is last seen helping the Paynes move out of their apartment as well as saying farewell to them. The character started minor but developed a grounded position in the group after Tisha Campbell briefly left the show. Nipsey (Sean Lampkin) (seasons 3–5), the rotund, good-natured bartender who owns Nipsey's Lounge, the gang's favorite hangout. Nadine Waters (Judyann Elder): Gina's doting and somewhat over-protective mother, who comes on as sophisticated, sweet and mild-mannered on the surface, but has shown a lustful side on occasion—such as once getting immediately turned on by a brief scene from a porn video, and generally becoming quite flustered whenever conversation or situations turned to sexual subjects. Dr. Cliff Waters (J.A. Preston): Gina's overbearing and overprotective father who works as a chiropractor. Instantly disliked Martin because he didn't feel he was good enough for his daughter. During the wedding rehearsal dinner, he threatens to start ""capping"" people, instantly inciting a major fight with members of the Payne family. Lil' Dawg (Adrian Tibbs): A tall, lanky barber at Jim's Barber Shop whose unorthodox personal style is the subject of much ribbing in the workplace—he keeps his head nearly shaved, but grows a long mane of hair in back, and wears Coke-bottle-thick glasses. He is often seen at Nipsey's trolling for women (successfully!), and despite his looks and demeanor always seems to come out on top whenever he and Martin have a disagreement. Buckwhite (Ray Massara): Buckwhite is described as a laid-back, tall white individual with a large dark Afro. He is often seen at locations like Jim's Barber Shop, Martin's apartment for sports events, and Nipsey's Lounge. Despite being white, he speaks Ebonics in a natural and unaffected manner. It's noted that the character is portrayed by someone involved in the film and television industry, specifically serving as a property master and special-effects assistant during the time of his appearances on Martin. Bro Fo' Real (Brother For Real) (Charlie Murphy): A faithful audience member of Martin's ""Word on the Street"" television program, and quite possibly Martin's number one fan. Bro Fo' Real attends every of Martin's taping for his show and encouraged Martin to be himself during one of the show's tapings (Season 3, Episode 14). Angry Man (David Jean Thomas): A fellow audience member of Martin's ""Word on the Street"" television program, and often can be found in other locations such as the DMV. He is prone to stand up and shout ""Man.... SIT-CHO ASS DOWN!!"" when a guest (or anyone else, for that matter) says something he disagrees with. Mr. and Mrs. Booker (Jeris Lee Poindexter and Ellia English): A married couple and audience members of Martin's ""Word on the Street"" television program. The Bookers are constantly arguing. Mr. Booker appears to be somewhat goofy and dimwitted, while Mrs. Booker is loud and aggressive. Their most prominent appearance is in the Season 4 episode ""Kicked to the Curb"", where they assist Martin and Gina in getting their apartment back, by scaring off the new tenants after Mrs. Booker pretends to be a scorned wife looking to fight the woman who was ""creeping with her husband"". Maddie Brown (Laura Hayes): Cole's gossiping, no-nonsense mother who still supports him. She's known for talking about other people and spreading their business around. For example, Martin being broke and having Gina support him. Evelyn Porter (LaWanda Page): A senior resident who lives in Martin's apartment building who is also friends with Mama Payne and Cole's mother, Maddie. Reverend Leon Lonnie Love (David Alan Grier): A local fire-and-brimstone preacher whose brand of religion doesn't seem to frown upon avarice, lying, cheating, stealing, and philandering—even with his own cousin Pam. Marian (Roxanne Reese): A seemingly well-heeled, middle-aged neighborhood alcoholic who often appears at parties, nightclubs, and gatherings, such as the audience on Martin's show Word on the Street and The Ladies League of Detroit. However, in one episode, she reveals that she is not drunk, that she is instead on medication. Kenji (Kenneth Whack): Dragonfly's student. Laquita (Simbi Khali): The nail stylist at Sheneneh's Sho' Nuff Hair Salon and Sheneneh's even-more vocal best friend. Keylolo (Yo-Yo): A hairstylist at Sheenah's Sho' Nuff Hair Salon. She is also Sheneneh's sidekick. Bonquisha (Kim Coles): Another one of Sheneneh's friends who always has bad breath. Bonquisha routinely claims that Keylolo is the one that has bad breath stating that was ""eaten chitlins"". Sonny (Reno Wilson): Martin's shoplifting cousin who dresses and acts like Eddie Murphy. Varnell Hill (Tommy Davidson): A successful talk show host who had been a WZUP DJ, leaving WZUP for greener pastures shortly after Martin began work there. When Martin was scheduled to open a community center, Stan bumped him in favor of Varnell being in town, setting events in motion for Martin. Varnell invited Martin to be on his show if he is ever in Hollywood, but when Martin shows up, he is ignored, causing Martin to see that success means nothing without integrity. Tommy Davidson reprised his role as Varnell Hill in 2020 as a guest on Martin Lawrence's cooking webshow, complete with a canary yellow suit. Luis (Luis Antonio Ramos): The superintendent of the apartment building where Martin lives. In one episode, he marries Pam to avoid deportation. Titus (Bentley Kyle Evans): A handsome well-dressed guy who is Gina's hairdresser, and seems to be attracted to Martin—affectionately calling him ""Almond"". (Evans was the executive producer of Martin; he made several cameo and voice-only appearances throughout the series, including one of the callers on WZUP, a guest at one of Gina's parties, and the only guy who appeared at an all-male fashion show that Pam and Tommy sponsored.) Myra (BeBe Drake-Massey): Stan's girlfriend; they once double-dated with Martin and Gina (while Martin was on the outs with Cole, Pam and Tommy). She was a customer of Sheneneh's hair salon, and went bald after Gina treated her hair. She was last seen in season 3 working as a clerk at the unemployment office. After Martin leaves several low-paying jobs due to feeling he is making slow progress, Myra is fed up with him, but gets him a job after realizing he learned his lesson - buffing floors. Gloria Rodriguez (Angelina Estrada): Station director and Martin's supervisor at television station Channel 51. Martin's work at Station 51 is more efficient than it was at WZUP, arguably because Mrs. Rodriguez is more professional in her duties than was Stan. Bernice (Kymberly Newberry): A producer at Channel 51 who is always at odds with Martin. (Kymberly Newberry also briefly played an entirely different part of a shoe-saleswoman in episode 8 of season 2 ""You've Got a Friend"".) One of the notable running gags in ""Martin"" was Martin Lawrence portraying multiple characters through various costumes and prosthetic appliances. This comedic technique was often used as a plot device or for comic relief. The regular use of Lawrence playing multiple characters diminished after Season 4, and Season 5 featured only a few characters, including Sheneneh, Roscoe, and Elroy. Mama Payne's voice is heard in one episode of Season 5, and many characters from earlier seasons were seemingly written out of the series after their last appearances in Season 4. Sheneneh Jenkins: Played by Martin, she is an exaggerated parody of a stereotypical ""ghetto girl"": she always has on flashy clothesfashion accessories and hair weaves; nature has endowed her with a disproportionately oversized ghetto booty; and she speaks in African American Vernacular English. Sheneneh is the owneroperator of Sheneneh's Sho' Nuff Hair Salon. Mama Payne and Sheneneh were the only two characters Lawrence played as women on the show, and both characters hated Gina. Full of quirks, Sheneneh is tall and thick in build and often describes herself as a ""la-a-a-dy"". Some of her other catchphrases are ""Oh mah goodnehhh!"" and ""Aw-iight?"" at every other word, and ""Oh, no you didn't."" Sheneneh's portrayed as being a very feisty, belligerent, touchy, antagonistic, confrontational and disparaging diva, known for her ghetto fabulous scoldings. She lives in the apartment across the hallway from Martin's and factors into many of the plots by picking fights with Gina and especially Pam out in the hallway. Sheneneh has several girlfriends who occasionally appeared in the program, those being Keylolo (Yo-Yo), Bonquisha (Kim Coles), and Laquita (Simbi Khali). Of all the secondary characters played by Lawrence, Sheneneh is the only one to make an appearance in the final episode, though only her voice was heard. The nae nae dance, created in 2013, was inspired by the way Sheneneh danced in Martin, and was named after the character. Edna (Mama) Payne: Martin's extremely frenetic, and easily excited mother, who is extremely over-protective of Martin, and who dislikes Gina immensely. Comically, Lawrence's mustache was never covered with stage make-up while in this role. Mama's mustache was occasionally the subject of a sharp retort by Gina when she and Martin argued. She has a brother named Junior (portrayed by John Witherspoon). Mama does not appear in the fifth and final season, but her voice is heard in the Christmas episode ""Scrooge"". She has the same catchphrase as her son Martin, ""Damn! Damn! Daaaaamn!"", a reference to the show Good Times. Ol' Otis: A very abrasive, strict, stuttering and potbellied old man, who is always seen in uniform while on his job as a security guard. His catchphrase is repeatedly referring to males as ""ba""  and females as ""ga"" . Otis is usually seen melodramatically and hyperactively attempting to keep order whether there's trouble or not. Because of his immense gut, advanced age, and oafish appearance, Otis is often taken for a weak old man who just acts tough. Because of this, he's often challenged to physical fights following his abrasive behavior. Otis is always more than willing to oblige others in engaging in combat. Surprisingly through his buffoonish-styled wrestling, unexpected strength from Otis always catches his ""antagonists"" off guard, invariably making him the victor in the end. Otis's pet peeve is misconduct in the ""younger generations"". When all is said and done, he physically defeats all his much younger challengers with ease. In his final episode on the show, he moves to an undisclosed island. Otis does not appear in the fifth and final season. Jerome: A loudmouthed, aging, somehow well-funded, once-flashy but now-faded Detroit pimp. He runs an illicit casino, sports a family-heirloom gold tooth (""gold toof-es"") in his mouth, was once voted Detroit's ""Player of the Year"", and has his sights set on Pam, as when he occasionally calls her ""Junk in the Trunk"". He often speaks in rhyming sentences. Jerome is shown to be very intelligent, as when cashiers at a convenient store were talking about him in their native language, he reveals his fluency to them shocking. Usually, Jerome appears on the scene with his signature spiel, ""Oooh, oooh, oo-oo-ooh, I say Jerome's in the house, I say Jerome's in the ah-um-ah-um... house! watch yo' mouth!"" Jerome's final appearance on the show is in the episode ""Uptown Friday Night"" (which parodies Uptown Saturday Night), in which his final line is ""And that's the eeeend!"" Jerome does not appear in the fifth and final season. Roscoe: An antagonistic child with a perpetually runny nose and a very smart mouth, who can be considered Gina's arch-enemy (similar to Martin and Pam's rivalry). Lawrence played the role by ""standing"" on his knees, with shoes attached to his kneecaps. Roscoe only appears once during the first, fifth and final season. Dragonfly Jones: A martial arts ""expert"" who is beaten up in nearly every appearance. He always seems to owe money to a real martial artist named Kenji, who is actually a student of Dragonfly. Kenji who would often beat up Dragonfly whenever he refuses to pay him some small sum he is owed. Dragonfly does not appear in the fifth and final season. Bob: A white man who works in an unknown capacity at the marketing firm where Gina is employed, Bob is best described as a stereotypical surfer-dude-cum-redneck. He speaks in a Southern Californian accent mixed with a Southern twang, and often uses words like ""dude"" and ""man"", even in professional settings. Lawrence achieved a white appearance with stage make-up and a prosthetic nose appliance to make him appear Caucasian, as well as wearing a long, blond mullet wig to complete the look. Bob only appears in 2 episodes, once in the first season and again in the second season. Elroy Preston: Preston Waters is a fictional character in ""Martin"" known as the ""Godfather of Black Surf Music."" He has become forgotten and washed up, working as an auto mechanic. Preston is recognized for spontaneously breaking into song while performing his mechanical duties, singing his trademark line ""Don't you know no good!"" repeatedly. He makes a single appearance in the fifth and final season of the show. King Beef: Cole's favorite 1970s blaxploitation movie actor, who is actually Lawrence in a huge bodysuit. Whenever trouble arises, he feels the overwhelming need to dance. It does not matter if he is on the run from Godzilla—he always finds time for dancing, and always with his scantily clad female co-stars flanking him. He is only seen during the first season. CGI Martin: A fictional CGI animated version of Martin Payne, who is only seen in the fourth and fifth season intro and bumpers. In 1997, Tisha Campbell filed a lawsuit against her co-star Martin Lawrence and the show's producers for sexual harassment and verbal and physical assaults, and she did not appear in most of the season five episodes. The explanation in most of the episodes Campbell did not appear in was that Gina was ""out on business"", though in the two-part episode ""Going Overboard"" it was stated that Gina had arrived too late to board the boat for the trip alongside everyone else. Tisha Campbell and Martin Lawrence had a legal dispute during the production of the television show ""Martin."" HBO Studios settled the case with Campbell to allow the completion of the last season. In the two-part series finale, Campbell returned to the set under the condition that she would not share any scenes or interact with Lawrence. The storyline was adjusted so that Martin and Gina were in different parts of the episode and never crossed paths. Martin went into second run syndication on August 8, 1995 through Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution; it airs multiple times a week on the networks of Paramount Global, including MTV2, VH1 and BET, with Max also carrying the full run of the series. Besides being purchasable on most digital video retailers, HBO Home Video released all five seasons of Martin on DVD in Region 1.",Normal

"Lorenzo Tio Jr. (April 21, 1893 – December 24, 1933) was an American clarinetist from New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. Tio was born into a family of musicians, including his father Lorenzo Tio Sr. (1867–1908) and uncle Louis ""Papa"" Tio (1862–1922). Their method of playing the instrument (which involved the Albert system, a double-lip embouchure and soft reeds) was seminal in the development of the jazz solo. The three Tios helped bring classical music theory to the ragtime, blues and jazz musicians of New Orleans; Lorenzo Jr. eventually played jazz himself. Lorenzo Sr. taught Louis Nelson Delisle. Many reed players significant in early jazz studied with Lorenzo Tio Jr., including Sidney Bechet, Barney Bigard, Johnny Dodds, Omer Simeon, Louis Cottrell, Jr., Jimmie Noone and Albert Nicholas. Tio Jr. taught Bigard what would become the main theme to the Duke Ellington tune, ""Mood Indigo."" Lorenzo Tio Jr. also played oboe. He joined Manuel Perez's band in Chicago in 1916 and Armand J. Piron's from 1918 to 1928, and recorded with Piron, Bechet, Jelly Roll Morton and Clarence Williams. After the dissolution of Piron's orchestra, Tio moved to New York in 1930, performing from 1932 with the orchestra at the Nest club. He died of heart disease in New York on December 24, 1933, at the age of 40. He was buried in New Orleans on December 31. This article about a United States jazz musician is a stub.

"Big Apple is an American crime drama television series that was originally broadcast in the United States on CBS from March 1 to April 5, 2001. The story centers on two New York City Police Department detectives Mooney and Trout working with the FBI to solve a murder with ties to organized crime. A subplot involves Mooney's sister who is receiving hospice care for Lou Gehrig's Disease. Big Apple was originally slated to compete with NBC's very popular medical drama series ER.

"The Arroyo Seco Bicycle Path is an approximately 2-mile (3.2km) long Class I bicycle path along the Arroyo Seco river channel and canyon in the Northeast Los Angeles region of Los Angeles County, California. It parallels the Arroyo Seco Parkway (CA Route 110), which is also a part of the canyon. The bicycle path connects: Montecito Heights at Ernest E. Debs Regional Park and the Montecito Heights Recreation Center; Hermon at Hermon Park and Ernest E. Debs Regional Park; and Highland Park at Sycamore Grove Park -- to the city of South Pasadena at the Arroyo Seco Stables.  The pathway travels under the cover of tall California sycamore and California oak trees. The southwest portion of the path, approximately 0.25 miles (0.40km), runs along the top of the channel and overlooks the Arroyo Seco through chain-link fencing. It then descends into the bed of Arroyo Seco flood control channel for the rest of the route. Following the channel hydraulics, there is a slight and consistent uphill grade in the northeastupstream direction, with some sections under overpasses having slightly greater slopes. Parking and access are located at Hermon ParkArroyo Seco Park, Sycamore Grove Park, Ernest E. Debs Regional Park, and the Montecito Heights Recreation Center. The Sycamore Grove Park access is via a pedestrian bridge over the Arroyo Seco. The path crosses several other pedestrian and vehicular bridges along its route. For flood safety reasons, if rain is predicted or if water release is expected from the upstream dam, public access is not permitted in the channel. The path continues as a walking and equestrian trail from its northern terminus, with only pedestrians and horses allowed beyond the Arroyo Seco Stables. However, bicyclists can continue on the Kenneth Newell Bikeway along Arroyo Boulevard just to the east, a quiet residential street that continues north in the Arroyo Seco to the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena.   From the path's southern terminus, the open air Heritage Square Museum and the Lummis House and gardens are nearby. Connections southwards to the Los Angeles River Bicycle Path several miles away are via the vehicle shared Figuroa Street to Riverside Drive.  The Arroyo Seco Bicycle Path is maintained by the City of Los Angeles. The Arroyo Seco river channel that the bike path is located in is maintained by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works. Especially after rain events, storm-borne debris accumulates on the path and poses a danger to cyclists and pedestrians. Other hazards include trash and debris such as beverage bottles, shopping carts, and electronics that are being illegally discarded into the channel from bridge overpasses. Due to periodical maintenance activities, the path is usually clear from any debris and provides an enjoyable recreational area. 34°05′47″N 118°11′25″W﻿ ﻿34.0965°N 118.1903°W﻿ 34.0965; -118.1903",Normal

It features a wide array of artists collaborating with Rogers on various songs on the album like All-4-One, The Katinas, Tareva Henderson and Bekka & Billy. The album hit the charts, with its strongest showing on the country charts at number 26, although it did not produce any hit singles. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated it 2.5 out of 5 stars, saying that "" Even with all these collaborators, the album sounds homogenous, especially since the material is entirely generic. However, it holds together better than most Rogers albums since the mid-'80s, because it is evident that some thought and care went into its production.""",Normal

"Walsden (ˈwɒlzdən; WOLZ-dən) is a large village in the civil parish of Todmorden in the Metropolitan Borough of Calderdale, West Yorkshire, England. It was historically partially administered in Lancashire (the Walsden Water as tributary to the Calder serving as the county boundary), and close to the modern boundary with Greater Manchester. It lies along the A6033 Keighley to Littleborough road in the Walsden Valley, a branch of the Upper Calder Valley, and is 2 miles (3.2km) south of Todmorden and 4 miles (6.4km) north of Littleborough. Walsden railway station, on the Leeds—Todmorden—Manchester line, originally opened in 1841 and re-opened 10 September 1990, having been closed for almost 30 years. The canal and A6033 between the former Bird in'th Hand pub and the Bellholme football pitches was also the only place to be bombed in Todmorden during the Blitz; the blasts breached the Rochdale Canal and broke a water main on Rochdale Road. Multiple small craters can still be picked out on both hillsides, one of which contains the Summit Tunnel trans-Pennine railway line, which may have been an alternative target for a raid primarily aimed at the Manchester area; its easterly Yorkshire end is less than ¼ mile away. The road was quickly repaired, the canal was shored up with earth from the former floodplain of Walsden Water (which is why the pitches are above the natural ground level) and the whole bombing incident was hushed up. Walsden was originally administered by Rochdale corporation in the county palatine of Lancashire, hence some of the local historical archives are held by Rochdale MBC. The village sits wholly within West Yorkshire with boundaries to Greater Manchester (south by southwest) and Lancashire (west by northwest) Although Walsden is the common name given to the area it is made up of numerous hamlets (as is commonplace to the region). Warland, Bellhome, Bottomley, Lanebottom, Deanroyd, Bottoms, Allescholes, Birkswood, Ramsden, Henshaw, Hollins and Copprashouse are all part of what is now generally referred to as Walsden. Walsden is a village in the civil parish of Todmorden and the Todmorden ward of Calderdale, a metropolitan borough within the ceremonial county of West Yorkshire in England. Walsden's name is of Anglo-Saxon origin meaning ""Valley of Foreigner"" or ""Valley of he who is Foreign"". Foreign refers to the Celtic Britons who lived in West Yorkshire at the time of the Anglo Saxon Petty Kingdoms. Thus, it has the same root as Wales and as Wallonia in Belgium. It has been said in the past that it comes from ""Wolves' Den"", this is dismissed as a folk etymology. The Parish Church is St. Peter's (Church of England), originally constructed between 1846–48. The Grade II listed spire of 1864 is all that remains of the Victorian church, which was devastated by fire on 28th May 1948. The rest of the building was reconstructed and reconsecrated in 1956, so that the nave now has a number of mid-century architectural features. The church has an associated school nearby, Walsden St Peter's CE (VC) Primary School. Walsden has a cricket club that plays in the major Lancashire Leagues.

"Housing Problems is a 1935 British documentary film produced by the Realist Film Unit for the British Commercial Gas Association. The fourteen-minute film documents the poor living conditions experienced by slum housing tenants in the East London district of Stepney, combining narration with interviews of tenants. It emphasises the role of the British Commercial Gas Association in providing social housing, interviewing residents of new housing projects about their improved conditions as well as displaying architectural models of housing estates planned by local authorities. Housing Problems does not have a credited director; however, production is credited to Arthur Elton and Edgar Anstey, and ""photography"" is credited to John Taylor. Ruby Grierson also worked as an uncredited assistant on the film, her first role in documentary filmmaking. It was one of the first documentaries that centred the voices of its subjects through the use of interviews. Whether these interviews were scripted remains a matter of debate. One of the housing models depicted is of the planned Quarry Hill Estate in Leeds. The film showcases the estate's innovative steel-frame architecture and open spaces, with amenities including a shopping centre and a welfare centre. In actuality, the Quarry Hill Estate was never fully completed; many of the intended amenities were never built, and it was completely demolished in 1978.

"Richard Russell Riordan Jr. (ˈraɪərdən RIRE-dən; born June 5, 1964) is an American author, best known for writing the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. Riordan's books have been translated into forty-two languages and sold more than thirty million copies in the United States. 20th Century Fox adapted the first two books of his Percy Jackson series as part of a series of films in which Riordan was not involved. Riordan currently serves as a co-creator and executive producer on the television series adaption of the book series that was released on Disney+ in 2023. Riordan's books have also spawned other related media, such as graphic novels and short story collections. Riordan's first full-length novel was Big Red Tequila, which became the first book in the Tres Navarre series. His big breakthrough was The Lightning Thief (2005), the first novel in the five-volume Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, which placed a group of modern-day adolescents in a Greco-Roman mythological setting. Since then, Riordan has written The Heroes of Olympus, a sequel to the Percy Jackson series; The Kane Chronicles, a trilogy of similar premise focusing on Egyptian mythology; and Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard, again a trilogy of similar premise focusing on Norse mythology. Riordan also helped Scholastic Press develop The 39 Clues series and its spinoffs, and penned its first book, The Maze of Bones. In 2021, he published Daughter of the Deep. His third standalone novel, The Sun and the Star, co-written with author Mark Oshiro, was published on May 2, 2023. Riordan was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas. He graduated from Alamo Heights High School, and first attended the music program at North Texas State University, wanting to be a guitarist. He transferred to the University of Texas at Austin and studied English and History. He received his teaching certification in those subjects from the University of Texas at San Antonio. He taught English and Social Studies for eight years at Presidio Hill School in San Francisco. Rick married Becky Riordan in 1985 on the couple's shared birthday. They have two sons, Haley and Patrick. They moved from San Antonio to Boston in June 2013, in conjunction with older son Haley starting college in Boston. Riordan has created several successful book series. Tres Navarre, an adult mystery series about a Texas private eye, won the Shamus, Anthony, and Edgar Awards. He conceived the idea for the Percy Jackson series as bedtime stories about ancient Greek heroes for his son Haley. Haley had been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia, inspiring Riordan to make the titular protagonist hyperactive and dyslexic. Riordan published the first novel in the series, The Lightning Thief, in 2005. Four sequels followed, with the last, The Last Olympian, in 2009. Prior to Percy Jackson, Riordan had written the Tres Navarres series, a series of mystery novels for adult readers. His Percy Jackson & the Olympians series features the titular twelve-year-old who discovers he is the modern-day son of the ancient Greek god Poseidon. 20th Century Fox purchased the film rights and released two feature film adaptations between 2010 and 2013. Following the success of Percy Jackson, Riordan created The Kane Chronicles, which features a modern-day Egyptian pantheon and two new sibling protagonists, Sadie and Carter Kane. Riordan also created a sequel series to Percy Jackson, The Heroes of Olympus. Riordan also helped create the children's book series The 39 Clues. He authored several of its books, including The Maze of Bones, which topped The New York Times Best Seller list on September 28, 2008. He also wrote the introduction to the Puffin Classics edition of Roger Lancelyn Green's Tales of the Greek Heroes, in which he states that the book influenced him to write his Greek mythology series. In 2022, Riordan co-wrote the pilot for the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series on Disney+ and is serving as an executive producer for the show. Disney had earlier acquired Fox in 2019, allowing it to gain the rights to adapt the Percy Jackson novels. Published individually first, then as an anthology titled Demigods and Magicians in 2016. In September 2016, Disney-Hyperion announced a new Rick Riordan imprint. The imprint is called ""Rick Riordan Presents"" and was launched in March 2018. It is headed by Riordan's editor, Stephanie Owens Lurie. Lurie said that Riordan had been approached about an imprint several years ago but initially dismissed the idea because of his heavy workload. Later, he reported back that he had been ""toying with the idea"" and was ""willing to go forward with a publishing line that was not a brand extension for his own work but a platform for Riordan to bring other great writers to the attention of his vast and loyal audience."" She also said that the imprint planned to launch with two then undetermined books. ""The point of making this announcement now is to get the word out about what we're looking for."" The imprint will not publish books written by Riordan, ""whose role will be closer to curator"". In an interview with the Iowa Gazette, Riordan said, ""Instead of me writing all of the mythologies we are going to look for authors who already are writing about that stuff. If I feel like I can recommend them  ... we're going to have them out here in the spotlight."" A focus will be placed on ""diverse, mythology-based fiction by new, emerging, and under-represented authors"". Lurie expressed hopes that the imprint will help satisfy Riordan fans without asking the author to write more than his usual two books a year.",Normal
"Ju-On: The Grudge is a 2002 Japanese supernatural horror film written and directed by Takashi Shimizu. It is the third installment in the Ju-On series and the first to be released theatrically (the first two being direct-to-video productions). It stars Megumi Okina, Misaki Ito, Takashi Matsuyama, and Yui Ichikawa. Ju-On: The Grudge premiered at the Screamfest Film Festival on 18 October 2002, by Lions Gate Films. The film received favourable reviews from critics, but was initially unfavourably compared to another Japanese horror film, Ring. Subsequent reception has been more positive, with both Ju-On and Ring being considered two of the greatest horror films ever made. It spawned a franchise, an American remake, 2006 and 2009 sequels and a 2020 sidequel to the remake, and a prequel television series entitled JU-ON: Origins which premiered in 2020. Several years prior to the main plot, Takeo Saeki murders his wife Kayako after discovering she is in love with another man, also killing the family cat, Mar, and his son, Toshio. The murders create a curse that revives the family as vengeful ghosts, with Kayako's ghost murdering Takeo. Whoever enters their house in Nerima, Tokyo, is eventually consumed by the curse, which spreads to the place they die in and in turn consumes anyone who comes in. The latest owners of the house are the Tokunaga family, consisting of salaryman Katsuya, his wife Kazumi, and his ill mother Sachie. Kazumi is quickly consumed by the curse, and Katsuya is emotionally affected by Takeo's personality before dying too. Katsuya's sister Hitomi dies shortly after Kayako's spirit follows her to her office and then her apartment. Social worker Rika is sent by her boss Hirohashi to care for Sachie. She discovers Toshio and witnesses Sachie being killed by Kayako's ghost, causing her to faint. Hirohashi finds Rika and contacts the police. Detectives Nakagawa and Igarashi discover Katsuya's and Kazumi's bodies in the attic and later learn of Hitomi's disappearance and the death of a security guard at her workplace. Hirohashi's body is discovered, and Rika is haunted by the ghosts. Upon researching the history of the house and the Saeki murders, Nakagawa and Igarashi contact a retired detective named Toyama, who is afraid of revisiting the case. Toyama goes to burn the house down but hears a group of teenage girls upstairs. One flees while the others are consumed. Kayako appears, chasing Toyama away but killing Nakagawa and Igarashi. Toyama eventually dies, leaving behind a daughter named Izumi. As a teenager, Izumi went to the house with her friends but fled while her friends were killed by Kayako; this was the event Toyama witnessed in the past. Izumi is wrought with guilt for abandoning her friends and becomes increasingly paranoid and unstable. Two of her other friends visit her and discover Izumi and her dead friends have their eyes blackened out in photos. Izumi encounters a vision of her dead father and then discovers the ghosts of her friends watching her. She is cornered by her dead friends, only for Kayako to appear and drag her into damnation. Some time later after visiting the house, Rika has moved on with her life. Her friend Mariko, an elementary school teacher, pays a visit to Toshio, who is registered as her student but has never shown up for class. Rika races to save her but is too late. Kayako's ghost comes after her, and Rika witnesses Kayako briefly take on her appearance. She realizes that she is doomed to play out the curse and the same fate as Kayako. With Toshio watching from the banisters, Takeo’s ghost descends the stairs and kills her. In the deserted Tokyo streets, many missing persons' posters lie on the ground. Rika's corpse, now with a much longer hairstyle similar to Kayako's, lies in the house's attic, only to reawaken with a death rattle. Ju-On: The Grudge was filmed entirely in Tokyo. Some critics have identified loose connections between the story in the film and the traditional Japanese folktale Yotsuya Kaidan. In 2004, Sony Pictures Entertainment released an American remake of the film. The film was directed by Takashi Shimizu and starring Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr. The main plot of the film follows Rika's experience within the house but with a different ending. Its sequel, The Grudge 2, however, mirrors a similar ending where Aubrey Davis meets the same fate as Rika. A sidequel of the original 2004 American film was released on 3 January 2020. Ju-on: The Grudge was shown on 18 October 2002 at the Screamfest Horror Film Festival in Los Angeles California under the title The Grudge. The film was also released as part of the Toronto International Film Festival's ""Midnight Madness"" screening in September 2003.

The disc contains an audio commentary with Sam Raimi and Scott Spiegel and interviews with the cast and crew. A sequel to the film titled Ju-on: The Grudge 2 also directed by Shimizu was released in 2003. The film received critical acclaim upon release, receiving a fresh 80% on Rotten Tomatoes. At Metacritic, a website which assigns a rating out of 100 for reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 48, based on 22 reviews indicating ""mixed or average reviews"". The Washington Post gave the film a mixed reviewing, stating that it ""isn't particularly scary. No, it's much harder on you than mere fright: It's... creepy"" and ""it lacks any interest in conventional narrative and doesn't bother with hero or heroine, or with any sense of coherency, of any mechanism of solution of its mystery"". David Kehr of The New York Times compared the film unfavourably to The Ring (1998), opining that Ju-on: The Grudge ""turns into a rote series of killings, with each new sequence introduced by a title with the name of its primary victim. Because there is a new hero to identify with every 10 minutes, the viewer isn't drawn into a sustained suspense, but is merely subjected to a series of more or less foreseeable shocks"". Kim Newman gave the film three stars out of five in Empire, noting that ""as a film, it is at once too much a part of an overarching story and divided into too many episodes to be all of a piece. However, as a sustained collection of scare moments, it's a winner"". Derek Elley compared the film unfavourably to both The Ring and Dark Water, writing that ""in the end, The Grudge comes down to little more than when and where the ghostly little boy will next appear, and the final explanation is so-what"". The film's reception has changed to become more positive over time, with many fans and critics now frequently listing it as one of the greatest Japanese horror films ever made. ",Normal

Ugly Lies the Bone was a New York Times Critic's Pick and played a sold-out, extended run at Roundabout Theatre in 2015. In The New York Times review of the play Charles Isherwood wrote that Ferrentino was ""a brave playwright of dauntless conviction whose unflinching portraits are hard to come by outside of journalism."" Deadline Hollywood described Ugly Lies the Bone as, ""clearly the work of a young talent with plenty ahead of her."" The Observer described it as, ""raw and inescapably moving. A play of small moments that hide big emotions."" Ferrentino received the 2016 Kesselring Prize for Ugly Lies the Bone. It was later produced at The National Theatre in London in the 900-seat Lyttleton Theatre in 2017. In 2018, Amy and the Orphans premiered at Roundabout Theatre Company and was called “barrier breaking” in the New York Times. Featuring American Horror Story's Jamie Brewer, Amy and the Orphans is the first Off-Broadway (or Broadway) show to have an actor with Down syndrome in a leading role.

"The Beakful, in French, La Becquée, or Woman Feeding Her Children is an oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Jean-François Millet, made in 1860. It is held at the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille. This canvas was the culmination of a long process that began with sketches and preparatory drawings made during 1848–1849. Some of the drawings are also kept at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Lille. A painted sketch of Woman Feeding Her Children, made in 1848, is held at the Ahmed Zabana National Museum, in Oran, Algeria. Acquired in the 1950s, it was stolen in 1985 and found in France in 2001. It was returned to the Algerian authorities in 2014. A mother, squatting on a stool in front of her farmhouse door, gives soup to her three children seated on the threshold, while the father, in the background, digs his garden. Three chickens are depicted. In a letter addressed to the art critic Théophile Thoré-Burger, who saw the canvas exhibited in the Martinet Gallery, Millet explained: ""I would like  to imagine a brood of birds being fed by their mother. Man works to feed these beings”. Millet sketched his models on the spot, but went back to his studio to paint. The comparison between the preparatory drawings, made long before, and the final painting, reveals a maturation of the painter's intentions in the composition of the canvas. If the theme itself is immediately present, the construction of the painted scene directs the viewer's towards the father who works the land, at the right. Although barely visible, it holds a central place in the encenation of the nourishing actions assigned to each of the parents. Everything then contributes to express family harmony, from the eyes and hands of the children brought together by the tenderness of the figures of their parents, their massive and protective mother, and their discreet and hardworking father, both united in their function, nurturing. The family harmony is further reinforced by the harmony of the play of colors and by the light that bathes the scene. In 1871, the painting was the property of Madame Maracci, a wealthy patron who wished to donate to the city of Lille a painting by Auguste-Joseph Herlin, then assistant to the curator of the city's painting museum. Herlin, embarrassed, dissuaded her, and convinced her to donate a work by another artist. This is how Millet's painting entered the museum.",Normal

"A. Hunter & Son (also known as Hunter & Webb and Alfred Hunter but generally referred to as Hunter) was an English pipe organ maker and refurbisher, established in London in 1856. Hunter was best known for the instruments at St Cuthbert's Philbeach Gardens and St James's, Spanish Place. The firm was acquired by Henry Willis & Sons in 1937. Alfred Hunter (1827-1911) was born in Lambeth, the son of Frances Steare Hunter, a wax chandler, and his wife Mary.  He was baptised at St Mary's, Lambeth in 1827. (St Mary's, Lambeth had a 1700 Renatus Harris organ; in 1918 Hunter's firm restored it, but the church was made redundant in 1972, and the organ was broken up.) He was apprenticed to George Maydwell Holdich, and then worked for Henry Bevington and JC Bishop (Holdich had been apprenticed to Bishop). In 1851 he was a journeyman organ builder. In 1856 he entered into partnership with Henry Webb (1821-bef 1881), as Hunter & Webb, at 14A Griffin Street, York Road, Lambeth. Webb was also a former Bishop employee; Hunter and Webb's wives were sisters. The partnership was dissolved at the end of 1864, and Webb became a publican. Hunter then worked on his own account, as Alfred Hunter, until 1882, first at 13 Lower Kennington Green, then at 379 Kennington Road and finally at 65A (later renumbered as 87) High Street, Clapham. The Clapham High Street premises were purpose-built by the Tate philanthropist architect, Sidney Smith. Hunter was a churchwarden at Holy Trinity, Clapham Common, which has a Hunter organ. In 1882 he entered into partnership with his son Robert (1856-1932),  as A. Hunter & Son. The firm continued to trade in that style after Hunter's death in 1911. In 1928 it moved to 235 Queens Road, Battersea. In 1937 it was acquired by Henry Willis & Sons. Robert's sons Alfred Robert (1885-1971) and George Frederick (1889-1963) both also joined the firm; there is no record of them continuing to work as organ builders after the firm was sold to Willis in 1937. They are both recorded as retired organ builders in the 1939 register. Hunter were specialists in pneumatic key action organs. ",Normal
"NKVD screening and filtration camps (Russian: Проверочно-фильтрационные лагеря НКВД СССР), originally known as NKVD special-purpose camps NKVD special camps (Russian: лагеря специального назначения НКВД СССР, спецлагеря НКВД), were camps for the screening of the Soviet soldiers returned from enemy occupied territories, enemy imprisonment, or enemy encirclement. There was concern among Soviet leaders that citizens that had been outside the supervision of the government and security services may need screening to ensure their political loyalty. By the end of World War II they handled screening of all people from the Soviet territories occupied by Nazi Germany. The NKVD special-purpose camps were established by NKVD Order No. 001735 of December 28, 1941, titled ""О создании специальных лагерей для бывших военнослужащих Красной Армии, находившихся в плену и в окружении противника"" (""On the establishment of special camps for former soldiers of the Red Army who were in captivity, or were surrounded by the enemy""). By NKVD Order No. 00100 of February 20, 1945, they were renamed to ""проверочно-фильтрационные лагеря"" (""verification and filtration camps""). Surviving POWs (about 1.5million), repatriated Ostarbeiter, and other displaced persons totaling more than 4,000,000 people were sent to special NKVD filtration camps (distinct from the Gulags).

"Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa (or Wayekwaa-gichigamiing Gichigamiwininiwag in the Ojibwe language, meaning ""Lake Superior Men at the far end of the Great Lake"") is an Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) band located near Cloquet, Minnesota. Their land base is the Fond du Lac Indian Reservation (Ojibwe language: Nagaajiwanaang), located mainly in Carlton and Saint Louis Counties, Minnesota, 20 miles west of Duluth. The Fond du Lac Ojibwe are one of six bands who comprise the federally recognized Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, which was organized in 1934 with a new constitution under the Indian Reorganization Act. In July 2007, their enrolled members numbered 4,044. The Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa originally inhabited the area along the lower courses of the Saint Louis River, where the present-day cities of Duluth, Minnesota and Superior, Wisconsin developed. The Wayekwaa-gichigamiing controlled the river access to both the Saint Louis and the Nemadji River rivers, major trade-routes during the decades of the fur trade with European traders. In the same area is Spirit Island of the ""Sixth Stopping Place"", one of the former seven Anishinaabe administrative centers. The Fond du Lac Band's regional economic influence helped establish the American Fur Company's trading post in what now is the Fond du Lac neighborhood of Duluth. Two different Treaties of Fond du Lac were signed by the Fond du Lac Band. In December 1861 a special Indian interpreter in Bayfield organized a trip to Washington D.C. for nine Chippewa Chiefs to meet President Lincoln. The Fond Du Lac band sent two, Chief Naw-Gaw-Nub (he sits ahead) and Chief O-be-quot (Firm). Lincoln gave all a President's Medal with his image dated 1862. There exists a photo of the delegation attributed to Matthew Brady with Chief Naw-Gaw-Nub seated center. There are multiple spellings for Chief Naw-Gaw-Nub's name owing to Americans having difficulty pronouncing the Ojibwe language: Naaganab, Naw-Gaw-Nab, Na-Gon-Nub or Na-Gon-Ab. On September 2, 1862, a letter was sent from the Fond Du Lac St. Louis Reservation to Governor Alexander Ramsey. Chief Naw-Gaw-Nub and Chief Shin-Gwack (Zhin-gob) requested that the Governor relay to Lincoln that the Fond du Lac Chippewa wanted to help with the Sioux Uprising. They understood that Lincoln needed Minnesotans to fight the south and they ""begged"" that the Chippewa be offered the opportunity to ""help put down the evil spirit of their old enemy"" who had ""murdered men, women, and children."" All they asked was ""that the weapons be provided and that their family's be taken care of while they were gone"". They also offered to accept a ""white"" commander as long as they were allowed to use traditional Chippewa methods in battle"". The letter made the newspapers in St Paul on September 13 and 19, 1862, the New York Times the next day, the Chicago Times two days later.and in Washington D.C.         A few days later the Head Chief of the Mille Lacs Band took 700-750 warriors made the same offer at Fort Ripley and offered to defend the fort from a rumored attack by Hole in the Day. Chief Naganab's passing made the New York Times in 1897. The largest community on the reservation is the city of Cloquet, of which only the sparsely populated western half of the city is on reservation land. As of 2000, that part has a population of 1,204 persons out of the city's total of 11,201. The only community completely on the reservation is Brookston, at the reservation's northern end. The Band operates two casinos, the Fond du Luth Casino in Duluth and the Black Bear Casino Resort on the reservation. An agreement signed with the City of Duluth, in which property with-in city limits was given to the tribe to build the Fond du Luth Casino in return for profit sharing $6 million, approximately 20%, from slot machine gross revenue, was agreed upon in 1994. Profits are no longer shared with the city due to violation of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The band has prevailed in court. On August 31, 2018, the Band reached an agreement to let Enbridge build its Line 3 replacement pipeline across the Reservation. The agreement extended Enbridge's rights of way on the Reservation by 10 years, to 2039. The financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. The arrival of twelve American bison was celebrated in November 2022 which had been absent from the reservation since they nearly went extinct in the late 1800s. The Nature Conservancy provided the animals, known scientifically as bison, to a native-owned and operated business from one of their preserves in Nebraska with transportation assistance from the Tanka Fund. They were welcomed with a prayer, a song, and a community meal as buffalo have a cultural and a spiritual connection to indigenous communities. The Conservancy and the Tanka Fund support an effort to enrich Native lives with the re-establishment of a sustainable buffalo economy. The revised Constitution and By-Laws of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe were approved by the Secretary of Interior on March 3, 1964. The governing body of the Fond du Lac Indian Reservation is the Reservation Business Committee, which is composed of a Chairman, Secretary-Treasurer, and three Representatives: one from District I (Cloquet), one from District II (Sawyer) and one from District III (Brookston). All are elected to four-year terms on a staggered basis, with the Chairman and Secretary-Treasurer also serving as members of the Executive Committee of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. The current members of the Reservation Business Committee are: Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa is one of six members of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe (MCT), from which it receives certain administrative services and support.

"Doug Cloud (born 1957) is a lawyer and perennial candidate, best known for running for U.S. House of Representatives from Washington's 6th congressional district five times since 2004. Cloud graduated from Fife High School and received a B.A. in economics from the University of Washington before going on to earn a J.D. from the University of Washington School of Law. Cloud began his legal career working as a prosecutor for Pierce County and Kitsap County before opening a Tacoma, Washington based law firm in 1992. Cloud, a Republican, has faced longtime congressman Norm Dicks in the general election from Washington's 6th congressional district in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010. His best showing was in 2010 when he received 42 percent of the vote. During that campaign he raised just short of $120,000 (40 percent of which was self-financed), being easily bested by Dicks who received $1.4 million in campaign donations. Cloud's worst performance was in 2006 when he earned less than 30-percent of the vote. In 2012, following Dicks' retirement, he again sought election from the sixth district but was eliminated in the primary. After his defeat in 2010, Cloud sued the U.S. government over the Federal Bureau of Investigation's rejection of a Freedom of Information Act request his campaign had filed regarding a federal investigation into Dicks. Cloud had asked for the investigative files of an FBI inquiry into Dicks' involvement with PMA Group, a lobbying firm accused of influence buying. The FBI had rejected the request on the grounds that fulfilling it would constitute an invasion of Dicks' privacy. The cornerstone of many of Cloud's past campaigns has been his opposition to the use of earmarks. He has made a special point of drawing attention to federal funding of the Puget Sound Partnership, a Washington state environmental agency formerly led by Dicks' son. ""He  used his power to set up multimillion-dollar funding to provide his kids with jobs duplicative of existing agencies,"" Cloud has criticized. Dicks has defended himself by asking ""why should we send people  if they don't do something to help their district?"" Cloud has also called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and increased enforcement of federal immigration law. He has signed the ""taxpayer-protection pledge"" circulated by Americans for Tax Reform. In addition to his frequent campaigns for a seat in the United States Congress, Cloud sought appointment to the Washington House of Representatives in 2013 to fill a vacancy created by the election of Jan Angel to the Washington Senate. He came in last place in a selection vote by local Republican leadership to succeed to the seat; Jesse Young was chosen by resolution of Kitsap County board of commissioners and Pierce County council from a list of recommendations provided by Republicans.

"Justin Morris Bibb (born April 26, 1987) is an American politician and former non-profit leader serving as the 58th mayor of Cleveland, Ohio since January 2022. Prior to serving as mayor, Bibb was the Co-Chair of Teach for America – Ohio, and a board member for the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority, Destination Cleveland, and LAND Studio. On January 12, 2021, Bibb announced his candidacy in the 2021 Cleveland mayoral election. In the crowded eight candidate primary, Bibb came in first with 27% of the vote in the September 14th primary, advancing him to the general election alongside the President of Cleveland City Council, Kevin J. Kelley. On November 2, 2021, Bibb won the city's mayoral election, defeating Kelley with a decisive 62% of the vote, becoming Cleveland's 4th African American mayor, and its 2nd youngest. Bibb was born in Cleveland and grew up in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood on the southeast side. He attended American University in Washington, D.C. where he earned a B.A in Urban Studies. During his undergraduate degree, he studied abroad at the London School of Economics where he completed The General Course program in Social Policy and Economics. In 2014, he returned to Cleveland and attended Case Western Reserve University School of Law and received his JD and MBA. Bibb interned for Senator Barack Obama in 2007 and began working in local government in 2011 as Special Assistant for Education & Economic Development for Cuyahoga County, where he established the Cuyahoga County Public Policy Fellowship Program. Bibb spent two years working in corporate strategy for Knowledge Generation Bureau before taking senior positions at Gallup (company), becoming the Head of Global Cities Practice in 2015. After working in New York and Washington, D.C, he returned to Cleveland to serve as Vice President at KeyBank in 2019. He worked as the Chief Strategy Officer at Urbanova, a business focused on technology for cities. Bibb formally announced his candidacy for mayor of Cleveland in early 2021, promising to bring new leadership and a sense of urgency to Cleveland's problems. He pledged to make public safety his number one priority. Three months after launching his committee, Bibb's campaign announced that it had raised $180,000, a significant sum for a first-time candidate and more than other candidates in the 2017 primaries. Bibb had a strong showing at the Cleveland Mayoral Candidates Forum on Criminal Justice held on April 28, 2021. 3,000 valid petition signatures are required to make the ballot for the 2021 Cleveland mayoral election, known as a relatively high hurdle. Bibb filed his petition to run for Cleveland Mayor at the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections on June 10, 2021. Bibb was announced as one of seven candidates to make the ballot on June 16, 2021. On August 8, 2021, Bibb was endorsed by the editorial board of cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer, Cleveland's major newspaper. On August 18, 2021, Bibb was then endorsed by two former Cleveland mayors, Michael R. White and Jane Campbell. On September 14, 2021, Bibb placed first in the mayoral primary, advancing him to the November 2 general election alongside City Council President Kevin Kelley. On November 2, 2021, Bibb defeated Kelley in the general election, receiving 62.86 percent of the vote. The voter turnout was at 23%. On January 3, 2022, Bibb was sworn in as the 58th Mayor of Cleveland. On January 31, 2022, at a press conference at Tower City Center, Bibb announced that for the NBA All-Star Game, hosted in Cleveland that year, all in attendance would have to be vaccinated against COVID-19. In May 2023, an investigation by WEWS-TV reported that Bibb's office had not been reporting city-funded travel expenses, estimating to be over $50,000, in contrast to his mayoral campaign highlighting a run on expediting requests for public records and the necessity for transparency. In February 2022, Bibb endorsed Shontel Brown for US Congress, against Nina Turner, who he first met on a funded trip to Israel, citing Brown having the ""right relationships"" with members of the Biden Administration for federal support to Cleveland. In March 2023, Bibb appointed Calley Mersmann and Jeffrey Weston Sleasman to the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority. In June 2023, Bibb appointed two new members to the Cleveland Metropolitan School District Board of Education, Robert Briggs and Diana Welch Howell. He also reappointed three existing members to the board, Sara Elaqad, Leah Hudnall and Denise Link. Elaqad serves as the new board chair with Hudnall as the new vice chair. In July 2023, Bibb appointed Andrew Sargeant to the Cleveland City Planning Commission. He named Michael Sanbury and Dr. Regennia Williams to the Cleveland Landmarks Commission. Bibb also announced the appointment of Luz Pellot, Robert Render III and Jay Westbrook to the Cleveland Community Relations Board. Additionally, Roland Muhammad and Rev. Charles Lucas were reappointed by Bibb to the Community Relations Board. In a budget proposal which was released in 2023, the mayor proposed an estimated overall budget of $1.9 billion with roughly $711 million in general fund spending. The proposed budget would create a $225,000 surplus for the city. Savings come from cutting hundreds of vacant positions, including 41 vacant positions in public works, 10 in building and housing, 7 in the division of health, equity and social justice, and lastly 28 in emergency medical services. The mayor was an opponent of the People's Budget charter amendment that he previously supported, as a form of participatory budgeting. In May 2023, Bibb proposed a new policy that would provide parental leave to eligible Cleveland city employees. The policy would allow for 20 hours of leave prior to the birth or adoption of a new child and 480 hours of leave following. There would also be a provision to provide leave for employees who experience a loss of pregnancy. The legislation was approved by the Cleveland City Council in June 2023 and will apply to approximately 7,000 city employees. On October 7, 2023, Bibb posted on Twitter in support of Israel, stating “Cleveland stands in solidarity with Israel in the face of terror and condemns these acts of evil.” Critics of the Pro-Israel statements, including from within the Cleveland Palestinian community, called the Bibb's support for Israel ""self-serving"", citing his support from Israel Bonds supporters. On October 31, Pro-Palestine Cleveland demonstrators attended a City Council meeting to call for the city to support a ceasefire.  In September 2023, Bibb introduced the ""Residents First"" plan intended to address housing issues. The plan would tighten housing codes and introduce civil penalties for code violations. The plan also focuses on vacant properties, introducing systems in an attempt to prevent livable properties from sitting empty. One of Bibb's public policy initiatives has been focusing on reforming the Cleveland Police Department. With the goal of promoting accountability throughout the department, Cleveland voters passed Issue 24, a ballot initiative that created a commission made up of 13 Cleveland community members. The implementation of Issue 24 allows for citizens selected to the commission to make decisions surrounding the department's training, recruitment, and disciplinary action. The commission also takes power away from the city's public safety director and chief of police while putting it in the hands of Cleveland citizens. In October 2023, Bibb announced a plan for a ten million dollar Neighborhood Safety Fund in hopes of improving public safety in Cleveland. Bibb seeks to use the funds to help foster education and mentorship in an effort to combat the root causes of crime in the city. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, cities across the country, including Cleveland, received funding from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). Bibb is able to use the funding from the ARPA stimulus relief for Cleveland's Neighborhood Safety Fund and must allocate the funds before the end of 2026. Bibb also unveiled a plan to generate a new deal with the city of Cleveland and the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association. Bibb's office, along with the Cleveland Police Union, agreed to shorten officer shifts to 12 hours and offer a pay increase to Cleveland officers. With these changes, the Cleveland Police Department will be in the 75th percentile for officer salary in Ohio. In November 2023, Bibb proposed to amend a September 2012 ordinance that set the maximum age to join the police force in Cleveland at 40 years old. Bibb would raise the age to 55 in an effort to encourage more citizens to join the police force. Cleveland had recently experienced a shortage of police officers and Bibb believes increasing the maximum age gives more opportunity for an increase of officers. Bibb's father was a police officer and firefighter. His first cousin-once removed is journalist, Leon Bibb.",Normal
"The 1971 Michigan Wolverines football team was an American football team that represented the University of Michigan in the 1971 Big Ten Conference football season. In their third season under head coach Bo Schembechler, the Wolverines compiled an 11–1 record, outscored opponents 421 to 83, won the Big Ten Conference championship, and were ranked No. 4 in the final UPI Poll and No. 6 in the final AP Poll. Defensive back Frank Gusich and center Guy Murdock were the team captains. The Wolverines were undefeated in the regular season, including three consecutive shutout victories over Virginia (56–0), UCLA (38–0), and Navy (46–0). Two later victories over Indiana (61–7) and Iowa (63–7) were the Wolverines' highest point totals since a 69-point tally in 1947. The Michigan-Ohio State game set an NCAA record with a crowd of 104,016 at Michigan Stadium. In the 1972 Rose Bowl, Michigan lost to Stanford, 13–12, on a field goal with 12 seconds remaining. Four Michigan players received first-team honors on the 1971 College Football All-America Team. They are: Linebacker Dana Coin set an NCAA record by successfully converting 55 of 55 extra points without a miss during the 1971 season. He was also the team's leading scorer with 79 points. The 1970 Michigan team compiled a 9–1 record and was ranked No. 7 in the final Coaches Poll and No. 9 in the final AP Poll. The 1970 team was not permitted to accept a bowl invitation, as Big Ten policy prescribed that the Rose Bowl was the only bowl game in which a conference team could participate. In March 1971, Michigan coach Bo Schembechler launched a public campaign to change the Big Ten's restrictive bowl participation policy. He noted that lesser teams had played in major bowl games and said, ""It was a crime what happened to us last season. We were the greatest team in the country not to play in a bowl game."" The conference eventually rescinded its one-bowl policy in 1975. Schembechler also spoke in opposition to the extension of the football schedule from 10 to 11 games for the 1971 season: ""I think the NCAA made a mistake in going to 11 games. . . . I love the game and I love to coach it but I also realize that in college they still have to go to school. . . . it does take away somewhat from their academic pursuits. I was concerned about that."" Important players lost from the 1970 team included quarterback Don Moorhead, who had set 24 school records, including those for most yards of total offense and most passing yards. The candidates to take Moorhead's spot as the team's starting quarterback included Tom Slade, Kevin Casey, and Larry Cipa. After the first spring scrimmage, Schembechler criticized the play of his quarterbacks: ""We have a lousy offense. We're going to have to run the ball every play."" Slade and Casey ended up starting eight and four games, respectively. Cipa was the only one of the trio who went on to play quarterback in the NFL. Other key players lost from the 1970 season included offensive lineman Dan Dierdorf, middle guard Henry Hill, and linebacker Marty Huff. Michigan was ranked No. 4 in the final pre-season poll. Michigan's recruiting class for 1971 included quarterback Dennis Franklin, running backs Chuck Heater and Gil Chapman, defensive back Dave Brown, linebacker Steve Strinko, and offensive lineman Dennis Franks. Chapman was the most heralded rookie back, having scored 564 points in high school. Michigan opened its 1971 season with a 21–6 victory over Northwestern in front of 42,472 spectators at Dyche Stadium in Evanston, Illinois. Sophomore Kevin Casey started at quarterback and completed only four of 11 passes for 34 yards and had one pass intercepted. Michigan's first touchdown was scored in the second quarter by split end Bo Rather on ""an 18-yard razzle-dazzle end around TD run"", with Jim Brandstatter making a key block. Rather scored again in the third quarter after a 51-yard field goal attempt by Dana Coin was knocked down by a Northwestern player as it fell short; Rather fell on the ball in the end zone, and the officials ruled it a live ball and fumble recovery. Tailback Billy Taylor scored Michigan's third touchdown on a five-yard touchdown run later in the third quarter. Taylor totaled 105 rushing yards on 28 carries in the game. Kicker Dana Coin converted all three point after touchdown attempts. On defense, Frank Gusich had two interceptions. Northwestern scored its touchdown in the fourth quarter on a short pass. After the game, coach Schembechler told the press, ""It was no masterpiece, but it was effective."" After a review of game films, center Guy Murdock was named Michigan's offensive champion, and Gusich, with his two interceptions, was named defensive champion. On September 18, Michigan defeated Virginia, 56–0, in the home opener before a crowd of 81,391 at Michigan Stadium. Michigan took a 35–0 lead at halftime and used its reserves extensively, including five quarterbacks and 11 running backs. Michigan's offense was heavily skewed in favor of the ground game, with 83 rushing carries and only 10 passes. The Wolverine backs carried the ball 83 times and totaled 495 rushing yards, including 107 yards by Ed Shuttlesworth and 89 yards, all in the first half, by Billy Taylor. Michigan scored seven rushing touchdowns, two each by Taylor and Alan Walker and one each by Shuttlesworth, Bob Thornbladh and Fritz Seyferth. Michigan's eighth touchdown was scored by Dave Elliott, the son of former Michigan player Pete Elliott, who fell on the ball after a Michigan kickoff was not fielded by Virginia as it made its way into the end zone. Kevin Casey started his second game at quarterback and completed two of five passes for 43 yards. Virginia completed only one pass and threw three interceptions. In total offense, Michigan out-gained Virginia, 566 yards to 78 yards. After the game, Virginia coach Don Lawrence praised Michigan's running backs: ""Those are the best six running backs I've ever seen together. We were there, but we just got knocked down."" Coach Schembechler opined, ""There's not much to say, is there? We were bigger and stronger physically than they were."" On September 25, Michigan defeated UCLA, 38–0, before a crowd of 89,177 in the rain at Michigan Stadium. Michigan led 24–0 at halftime on touchdown runs by Fritz Seyferth and Ed Shuttlesworth, a 31-yard field goal by Dana Coin, and a 32-yard touchdown pass from Kevin Casey to Bo Rather.

With 76 rushing yards, Taylor passed Tom Harmon and moved into second place among Michigan's career rushing leaders. Ed Shuttlesworth also ran for a two-point conversion in the second quarter. Kevin Casey started his fourth game at quarterback and completed only one pass for eight yards, as Tom Slade, Larry Cipa and Jack McBride replaced him after the first quarter and jointly completed eight of 13 passes for 145 yards. Cipa threw a 49-yard touchdown pass to Mike Oldham with three minutes remaining in the game. Dana Coin converted five points after touchdown and kicked a field goal. Michigan out-gained Navy by 428 yards to 71 yards. During a halftime ceremony, Michigan honored the crew of Apollo 15, James Irwin, David Scott, and Alfred Worden, all Michigan alumni. On October 9, Michigan won its fifth consecutive game, defeating Michigan State, 24–13, in front of 80,093 spectators, the largest crowd to that time in the history of Spartan Stadium in East Lansing, Michigan.

Tom Slade started his first game at quarterback, completed three of nine passes for 45 yards, and rushed for 48 yards and a touchdown. With Michigan State athletic director Biggie Munn in critical condition following a stroke, the Spartans kept the game close.

The Wolverines then sealed the game with a two-yard touchdown run by Taylor and a seven-yard touchdown run by Slade. Michigan kicker Dana Coin converted three point after touchdown attempts and kicked a 27-yard field goal.

Michigan also recovered four fumbles and played its reserves extensively, with a total of 68 players seeing game action. Dana Coin added a field goal and five extra points. After the game, coach Bo Schembechler sent his regrets to his close friend and Indiana coach John Pont; Schembechler told the press, ""I hate to beat anybody that bad, especially somebody I like."" On November 6, Michigan defeated Iowa, 63–7, in front of 72,467 ""shivering fans"" at Michigan Stadium.

Ohio State's final drive ended when Thom Darden intercepted a pass with one-and-a-half minutes remaining. After the interception, Ohio State coach Woody Hayes ran across the field, berating each of the officials. The officials assessed an unsportsmanlike conduct against Hayes. When another penalty was assessed against Ohio State linebacker Randy Gradishar for punching Michigan's backup quarterback, Larry Cipa. When the official moved the first-down markers to assess the penalty, Hayes pulled the markers from ground, threw one onto the field and threw the other to the ground, proceeding to then rip the plastic flag from the pole with his hand. The victory gave Michigan an undefeated record in the regular season for the first time since 1948. The game was the first Rose Bowl meeting between the two schools since the inaugural Rose Bowl in 1902, in which Michigan crushed Stanford, 49–0. In the 1972 rematch, Michigan was ranked #3 in the country and favored by 10½ points. Michigan's Dana Coin kicked a 30-yard field goal in the second quarter for the only first half scoring.

Stanford ran a fake punt, with Jim Kehl receiving the snap and handing the ball forward to Jackie Brown through Brown's legs. Brown ran 33 yards for a first down, and followed up a minute later with a 24-yard touchdown run to tie the game. Late in the fourth quarter, Michigan recovered a Stanford fumble near midfield. Facing fourth down with time running down, the Wolverines attempted a 42-yard field goal. The kick was short, and Stanford safety Jim Ferguson caught the ball and attempted to run it out of the end zone. Instead, he was knocked back into the end zone by Ed Shuttlesworth for a controversial Michigan safety, as replays seemed to show that Ferguson's forward progress was to the three-yard line. This made the score 12–10 with just over three minutes to play, and Michigan due to get the ball on a free kick. Following the free kick, Stanford held Michigan to a three-and-out and got the ball back on their own 22-yard line with 1:48 to go. Bunce then threw five consecutive completions to take Stanford to the Michigan 17-yard line with 22 seconds left. The Indians ran twice to get to the Michigan 14-yard line with 12 seconds left. From there, Stanford kicked a 31-yard field goal to give Stanford a 13–12 victory with 12 seconds left. In their third season under coach Schembechler, the Wolverines compiled an 11–1 record, outscored opponents 421 to 83, won the Big Ten Conference championship, and played in their second Rose Bowl in three years.

Prices for opening night, February 18, 1918: The Wells Becomes The Imperial On Sunday, October 6, 1918, over 3,000 cases of Spanish Flu were reported. With the death of 52 servicemen from a local military camp (now known as Fort Gordon), the city announced the closure of all public venues, including the theatre. The quarantine began October 7, and during this time Jake Wells encountered great financial difficulties. He sold The Wells to Lynch Enterprises. On November 27, 1918, shortly after the sell, the quarantine is lifted. Two weeks later the theatre opened under the name of Jake Wells with The B. F. Keith Supreme Vaudeville Co. After the acquisition of several other local theatres by Lynch Enterprises, The Wells Theatre's was changed to The Imperial Theatre. In 1929, as vaudevillian acts decreased in popularity and motion pictures enjoyed meteoric success, Miller decided to renovate the Imperial into a full-time movie house in the popular art deco style. In March 1936 ""The Trail of the Lonesome Pine,"" starring Henry Fonda and Fred MacMurray, became the first color film to be shown at the Imperial. It is in the Broad Street Historical District and is listed on the National Register as important to the character of the entire district. Due to the decline of the downtown area, the Imperial continued as a film theatre until it closed in 1981. In 1985 it was recognized for its architectural significance and reopened as a performing arts venue with the help of local performing arts groups like the Augusta Ballet and the Augusta Players. Today the Imperial Theatre is a vibrant arena for entertainment, with a full season of musicals, dance, concerts, comedy and more. It is noted in the National Register as critical to the character of the Broad Street Historic District. Currently, the Imperial is the only operating historic theatre in Augusta. Today, the Imperial is still the home for the Augusta Ballet, the Augusta Players, as well as the Morris Museum of Art's Southern Soul + Song Series, Storyland Theatre, Dance Augusta, Columbia County Ballet, Ed Turner and the Number 9 Band, Westobou Festival events and the Poison Peach Film Festival. Among the earliest recorded appearances was the visit of Charlie Chaplin, who appeared at the theatre on April 18, 1918, selling Liberty war bonds. Included in this bill of fare was Leo Carrillo, who later became the Cisco Kid's partner, Pancho; and the famous ballet dancer Anna Pavlova.",Normal
"The Antelope Range and Livestock Research Station is operated by South Dakota State University and its extension programs to improve ranching in the U.S. State of South Dakota. The site is 8,300 acres (3,400ha) large, the largest of SDSU's research stations. This land was owned by the state and operated as a pronghorn antelope preserve until 1947, when it was transferred to the agricultural university for research into ""the balance between cattle and sheep production and protection and renewal of range resources"". Current work focuses on sustainable beef and sheep production on rangeland. There are 120 head of beef cow and 400 sheep now on the range. North Dakota State University operates a similar research station at Hettinger, North Dakota, which often partners with SDSU's Antelope station for sheep research. The land is 14 miles (23km) east of Buffalo, South Dakota, south of South Dakota Highway 20. It lies in the middle of Harding County, South Dakota, in the far northwest corner of the state.

"Archaeopteris is an extinct genus of progymnosperm tree with fern-like leaves. A useful index fossil, this tree is found in strata dating from the Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous (383to323 million years ago), the oldest fossils being 385 million years old, and had global distribution. Until the 2007 discovery of Wattieza, many scientists considered Archaeopteris to be the earliest known tree. Bearing buds, reinforced branch joints, and branched trunks similar to today's wood, it is more reminiscent of modern seed-bearing trees than other spore bearing taxa; It combines characteristics of woody trees and herbaceous ferns, and belongs to the progymnosperms, a group of extinct plants with gymnosperm-like wood but that produce spores rather than seeds. John William Dawson described the genus in 1871. The name derives from the ancient Greek ἀρχαῖος (archaīos, ""ancient""), and πτέρις (ptéris, ""fern""). Archaeopteris was originally classified as a fern, and it remained classified so for over 100 years. In 1911, Russian paleontologist Mikhail Dimitrievich Zalessky described a new type of petrified wood from the Donets Basin in modern Ukraine. He called the wood Callixylon, though he did not find any structures other than the trunk. The similarity to conifer wood was recognized. It was also noted that ferns of the genus Archaeopteris were often found associated with fossils of Callixylon. In the 1960s, paleontologist Charles B. Beck was able to demonstrate that the fossil wood known as Callixylon and the leaves known as Archaeopteris were actually part of the same plant. It was a plant with a mixture of characteristics not seen in any living plant, a link between true gymnosperms and ferns. The genus Archaeopteris is placed in the order Archaeopteridales and family Archaeopteridaceae. The name is similar to that of the first known feathered bird, Archaeopteryx, but in this case refers to the fern-like nature of the plant's fronds. Archaeopteris is a member of a group of free-sporing woody plants called the progymnosperms that are interpreted as distant ancestors of the gymnosperms. Archaeopteris reproduced by releasing spores rather than by producing seeds, but some of the species, such as Archaeopteris halliana were heterosporous, producing two types of spores. This is thought to represent an early step in the evolution of vascular plants towards reproduction by seeds, which first appeared in the earliest, long extinct, gymnosperm group, the seed ferns (Pteridospermatophyta). The conifers or Pinophyta are one of four divisions of extant gymnosperms that arose from the seed ferns during the Carboniferous period. The trees of this genus typically grew to 24m (80ft) in height with leafy foliage reminiscent of some conifers. The large fern-like fronds were thickly set with fan-shaped leaflets or pinnae. The trunks of some species exceeded 1.5m (5ft) in diameter. The branches were borne in spiral arrangement, and a forked stipule was present at the base of each branch. Within a branch, leafy shoots were in opposite arrangement in a single plane. On fertile branches, some of the leaves were replaced by sporangia (spore capsules). Aside from its woody trunk, Archaeopteris possessed other modern adaptations to light interception and perhaps to seasonality as well. The large umbrella of fronds seems to have been quite optimized for light interception at the canopy level. In some species, the pinnules were shaped and oriented to avoid shading one another. There is evidence that whole fronds were shed together as single units, perhaps seasonally like modern deciduous foliage or like trees in the cypress family Cupressaceae. The plant had nodal zones that would have been important sites for the subsequent development of lateral roots and branches. Some branches were latent and adventitious, similar to those produced by living trees that eventually develop into roots. Before this time, shallow, rhizomatous roots had been the norm, but with Archaeopteris, deeper root systems were being developed that could support ever higher growth. Evidence indicates that Archaeopteris preferred wet soils, growing close to river systems and in floodplain woodlands. It would have formed a significant part of the canopy vegetation of early forests. Speaking of the first appearance of Archaeopteris on the world-scene, Stephen Scheckler, a professor of biology and geological sciences at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, says, ""When  appears, it very quickly became the dominant tree all over the Earth. On all of the land areas that were habitable, they all had this tree"". One species, Archaeopteris notosaria, has even been reported from within what was then the Antarctic Circle: leaves and fertile structures were identified from the Waterloo Farm lagerstätte in what is now South Africa. Scheckler believes that Archaeopteris had a major role in transforming its environment. ""Its litter fed the streams and was a major factor in the evolution of freshwater fishes, whose numbers and varieties exploded in that time, and influenced the evolution of other marine ecosystems. It was the first plant to produce an extensive root system, so had a profound impact on soil chemistry. And once these ecosystem changes happened, they were changed for all time. It was a one-time thing."" Looking roughly like a top-heavy Christmas tree, Archaeopteris may have played a part in the transformation of Earth's climate during the Devonian before becoming extinct within a short period of time at the beginning of the Carboniferous period.",Normal
"The Genève-Servette HC (also called Servette or GSHC) is a professional ice hockey club based in Geneva, Switzerland and competing in the National League (NL), the top tier of the Swiss hockey league system. The team plays their home games at the Patinoire des Vernets, which has a seating capacity of 7,135. The team is currently the oldest team in the NL, being founded in 1905. The Patinoire des Vernets was built in 1959 and is located in the Geneva neighborhood of the same name. It serves as the main arena for the GSHC. It was renovated in 2009 in order to increase the spectator capacity from 6400 to 7140. On January 24, 2012, local authorities and the club reached an agreement to build a new arena, in another part of town, with a seating capacity of 10,000. In 2012, it was scheduled to open by 2015, or possibly 2016. As of 2019, construction has yet to start. The official mascots of Genève-Servette are Calvin and Calvina, two anthropomorphic eagles that first appeared at the beginning of the 2006-2007 season. They are Switzerland's first and only mascot duet. Their names are derived from John Calvin, famous theologian of the Protestant reformation in Geneva. In addition, Sherkan, a bald eagle, opens every home game by flying throughout the arena, reaching for his master standing in the center of ice. Sherkan is very popular amongst fans and players alike. Sherkan is Europe's first living animal to partake in an ice-hockey game opening ceremony. Sherkan first appeared during the NLB playoffs of 2001 and has been present to every home game ever since, only missing two. Chris McSorley served as head coach and general manager between 2001 and 2017 and was also co-owner until 2014, alongside Hugh Quennec. Chris McSorley is the brother of Marty McSorley, two times winner of the Stanley Cup with the Edmonton Oilers. On March 22, 2017, Chris McSorley stepped down as head coach to focus on his job as general manager. A position he assumed for the entire 2017–18 season. At the end of this season, it was announced that McSorley would return as head coach of Geneva for the 201819 season, while keeping his position as general manager. McSorley had signed a 15-year contract with the team in September 2016 worth CHF 10 million, while the club was still under Quennec ownership. The contract runs through the 203031 season. On June 26, 2017, it was announced that Craig Woodcroft would replace McSorley at the helm of the team for the next three seasons. At the end of the 201718 season, Woodcroft was relieved of his duties as head coach after only one season. Geneva will still pay him the remaining CHF 2 million on his contract.

"The Bosphorus Bridge (Turkish: Boğaziçi Köprüsü), known officially as the 15 July Martyrs Bridge (Turkish: 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü) and colloquially as the First Bridge (Turkish: Birinci Köprü), is the southernmost of the three suspension bridges spanning the Bosphorus strait (Turkish: Boğaziçi) in Istanbul, Turkey, thus connecting Europe and Asia (alongside Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge and Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge). The bridge extends between Ortaköy (in Europe) and Beylerbeyi (in Asia). It is a gravity-anchored suspension bridge with steel towers and inclined hangers. The aerodynamic deck hangs on steel cables. It is 1,560m (5,118ft) long with a deck width of 33.40m (110ft). The distance between the towers (main span) is 1,074m (3,524ft) and the total height of the towers is 165m (541ft). The clearance of the bridge from sea level is 64m (210ft). Upon its completion in 1973, the Bosphorus Bridge had the fourth-longest suspension bridge span in the world, and the longest outside the United States (only the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, Golden Gate Bridge and Mackinac Bridge had a longer span in 1973). The Bosphorus Bridge remained the longest suspension bridge in Europe until the completion of the Humber Bridge in 1981, and the longest suspension bridge in Asia until the completion of the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge (Second Bosphorus Bridge) in 1988 (which was surpassed by the Minami Bisan-Seto Bridge in 1989). Currently, the Bosphorus Bridge has the 40th-longest suspension bridge span in the world. After a group of soldiers took control and partially closed off the bridge during the military coup d'état attempt on 15 July 2016, Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım proclaimed on 25 July 2016 the decision of the Cabinet of Turkey that the bridge will be formally renamed as the 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü (July 15th Martyrs Bridge) in memory of those killed while resisting the attempted coup. The Bosphorus Bridge is famous for its important transport routes, connecting parts of Europe to Turkey. The idea of a bridge crossing the Bosphorus dates back to antiquity. The Greek writer Herodotus says in his Histories that, on the orders of Emperor Darius the Great of the Achaemenid Empire (522 BC–485 BC), Mandrocles of Samos once engineered a pontoon bridge across the Bosphorus, linking Asia to Europe; this bridge enabled Darius to pursue the fleeing Scythians as well as position his army in the Balkans to overwhelm Macedon. Leonardo da Vinci proposed a suspension bridge to Sultan Bayezid II in 1502 or 1503. The first modern project for a permanent bridge across the Bosphorus was proposed to Sultan Abdul Hamid II of the Ottoman Empire by the Bosphorus Railroad Company in 1900, which included a rail link between the continents. The decision to build a bridge across the Bosphorus was taken in 1957 by Prime Minister Adnan Menderes. For the structural engineering work, a contract was signed with the British firm Freeman Fox & Partners in 1968. The bridge was designed by the British civil engineers Gilbert Roberts, William Brown and Michael Parsons, who also designed the Humber Bridge, Severn Bridge, and Forth Road Bridge. David B Steinman, an American engineer who had recently designed the Mackinac Bridge was also contracted, but died early on in the design process in 1960. Construction started in February 1970 and ceremonies were attended by President Cevdet Sunay and Prime Minister Süleyman Demirel. The bridge was built by the Turkish firm Enka Construction & Industry Co. along with the co-contractors Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company (England) and Hochtief AG (Germany). The bridge was completed on 30 October 1973, one day after the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Turkey, and opened by President Fahri Korutürk and Prime Minister Naim Talu. The cost of the bridge was US$200 million ($1.32billion in 2022 dollars). Upon the bridge's opening, much was made of its being the first bridge between Europe and Asia since the pontoon bridge of Xerxes in 480 BC. That bridge, however, spanned the Hellespont (Dardanelles), some distance away from the Bosphorus, and was the second bridge after the above-mentioned bridge built by Emperor Darius I The Great across the Bosphorus in 513 BC. The bridge highway is eight lanes wide. Three standard lanes, one emergency lane and one pedestrian lane serve each direction. On weekday mornings, most commuter traffic flows westbound to Europe, so four of the six lanes run westbound and only two eastbound. Conversely, on weekday evenings, four lanes are dedicated to eastbound traffic and two lanes, to westbound traffic. For the first three years, pedestrians could walk over the bridge, reaching it with elevators inside the towers on both sides. No pedestrians or commercial vehicles, such as trucks, are allowed to use the bridge today. Today, around 180,000 vehicles pass daily in both directions, with almost 85% being cars. On 29 December 1997, the one-billionth vehicle passed the bridge. Fully loaded, the bridge sags about 90cm (35in) in the middle of the span. It is a toll bridge. A toll is charged for passing from Europe to Asia, but not for passing in the reverse direction. Since 1999, some of the toll booths (#9 - #13), located to the far left as motorists approach them, are unmanned and equipped only with a remote payment system (Turkish: OGS) in order to not delay traffic. In addition to OGS, another toll pay system with special contactless smart cards (Turkish: KGS) was installed at specific toll booths in 2005. Since 3 April 2006, toll booths accept no cash but only OGS or KGS. An OGS device or KGS card can be obtained at various stations before reaching the toll plazas of highways and bridges. In 2006, the toll was 3.00 TL or about $2.00. Since April 2007, a computerised LED lighting system of changing colours and patterns, developed by Philips, illuminates the bridge at night. In 2012, KGS was replaced with the new HGS system, which uses radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology. In 2017, the toll increased by nearly 50% from 4.75 to 7 TRY. (On 10 March 2022, 7 Turkish TRY is worth $0.68US. Data from currencymatrix.com ) After 21 months, in late 2019, the toll went up another 20% to 10.50 TRY. The TRY value has dropped considerably in the first quarter of 2022. On 10 March 2022, 10.50 TRY was equivalent to $0.74US. Tolls need to be increased almost every year to keep up with high producers' price inflation. Every October, the annual Intercontinental Istanbul Eurasia Marathon crosses the bridge on its way from Asia to Europe. During the marathon, the bridge is closed to vehicular traffic. In October, visitors participate in the 'fun run' and cross the bridge on foot. Many take picnics to enjoy the view. The bridge was depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 1000 lira banknotes of 1978–1986. On 15 May 2005 at 07:00 local time, U.S. tennis star Venus Williams played a show game with Turkish player İpek Şenoğlu on the bridge, the first tennis match played on two continents. The event promoted the upcoming 2005 WTA İstanbul Cup and lasted five minutes. After the exhibition, they both threw a tennis ball into the Bosphorus. On 17 July 2005 at 10:30 local time, British Formula One driver David Coulthard drove his Red Bull racing car across the bridge from the European side to the Asian side, then, after turning with a powerslide at the toll plaza, back to the European side for show. He parked his car in the garden of Dolmabahçe Palace where his ride had started. While crossing the bridge with his Formula 1 car, Coulthard was picked up by the automatic surveillance system and charged with a fine of 20 Euros because he passed through the toll booths without payment. His team agreed to pay for him. On 5 November 2013, World No. 1 golfer Tiger Woods, visiting for the 2013 Turkish Airlines Open golf tournament held between 7 and 10 November, was brought to the bridge by helicopter and made a couple of show shots on the bridge, hitting balls from the Asian side to the European side on one side of the bridge, which was closed to traffic for about one hour. On 15 July 2016, the bridge was blocked by a faction of the Turkish Armed Forces during a coup attempt. A tank fired a shell and soldiers shot at people. They also arrested civilians and police officers. Some tanks ran over vehicles. The soldiers involved surrendered to police and to civilians the next day. On 25 July 2016, prime minister Binali Yıldırım announced that the bridge would be renamed as the 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü (July 15 Martyrs Bridge).",Normal
"Eurypegasus Pegasus The seamoths make up a family of fishes, the Pegasidae, within the order Syngnathiformes. They are named for Pegasus, a creature from Greek mythology. Seamoths are notable for their unusual appearance, including flattened bodies, the presence of large, wing-like, pectoral fins, a long snout, and a body encased in thick, bony plates. They are found primarily in coastal tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific. Seamoths have modified pelvic fins that allow them to ""walk"" across the sea bottom where they live. Their jaws are ventral, located behind their long rostrum, and are toothless. Their mouth is highly specialized, and can form a tube-like mouth used to suck worms and other small invertebrates from their burrows. They periodically molt their skin, perhaps as often as every five days. Pegasus laternarius is listed as a Vulnerable species by the IUCN, while the remaining four species of seamoth remain Data Deficient. Threats to seamoths come from various sources, including fisheries where they are caught as bycatch or on purpose for use in traditional Chinese medicines. They are also collected for sale in the aquarium trade. Bottom trawls and coastal development may detrimentally alter habitat used by benthic seamoths. Life history characteristics such as low population sizes and monogamy with long-term pair bonding put them at risk of exploitation. This Gasterosteiformes-related article is a stub.

"Thermal comfort is the condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment and is assessed by subjective evaluation (ANSIASHRAE Standard 55). The human body can be viewed as a heat engine where food is the input energy. The human body will release excess heat into the environment, so the body can continue to operate. The heat transfer is proportional to temperature difference. In cold environments, the body loses more heat to the environment and in hot environments the body does not release enough heat. Both the hot and cold scenarios lead to discomfort. Maintaining this standard of thermal comfort for occupants of buildings or other enclosures is one of the important goals of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) design engineers. Thermal neutrality is maintained when the heat generated by human metabolism is allowed to dissipate, thus maintaining thermal equilibrium with the surroundings. The main factors that influence thermal comfort are those that determine heat gain and loss, namely metabolic rate, clothing insulation, air temperature, mean radiant temperature, air speed and relative humidity. Psychological parameters, such as individual expectations, also affect thermal comfort. The thermal comfort temperature may vary greatly between individuals and depending on factors such as activity level, clothing, and humidity. The Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model stands among the most recognized thermal comfort models. It was developed using principles of heat balance and experimental data collected in a controlled climate chamber under steady state conditions. The adaptive model, on the other hand, was developed based on hundreds of field studies with the idea that occupants dynamically interact with their environment. Occupants control their thermal environment by means of clothing, operable windows, fans, personal heaters, and sun shades. The PMV model can be applied to air-conditioned buildings, while the adaptive model can be applied only to buildings where no mechanical systems have been installed. There is no consensus about which comfort model should be applied for buildings that are partially air-conditioned spatially or temporally. Thermal comfort calculations in accordance with the ANSIASHRAE Standard 55, the ISO 7730 Standard and the EN 16798-1 Standard can be freely performed with either the CBE Thermal Comfort Tool for ASHRAE 55, with the Python package pythermalcomfort and with the R package comf. Satisfaction with the thermal environment is important because thermal conditions are potentially life-threatening for humans if the core body temperature reaches conditions of hyperthermia, above 37.5–38.3°C (99.5–100.9°F), or hypothermia, below 35.0°C (95.0°F). Buildings modify the conditions of the external environment and reduce the effort that the human body needs to do in order to stay stable at a normal human body temperature, important for the correct functioning of human physiological processes. The Roman writer Vitruvius actually linked this purpose to the birth of architecture. David Linden also suggests that the reason why we associate tropical beaches with paradise is because in those environments is where human bodies need to do less metabolic effort to maintain their core temperature. Temperature not only supports human life; coolness and warmth have also become in different cultures a symbol of protection, community and even the sacred. In building science studies, thermal comfort has been related to productivity and health. Office workers who are satisfied with their thermal environment are more productive. The combination of high temperature and high relative humidity reduces thermal comfort and indoor air quality. Although a single static temperature can be comfortable, people are attracted by thermal changes, such as campfires and cool pools. Thermal pleasure is caused by varying thermal sensations from a state of unpleasantness to a state of pleasantness, and the scientific term for it is positive thermal alliesthesia. From a state of thermal neutrality or comfort any change will be perceived as unpleasant. This challenges the assumption that mechanically controlled buildings should deliver uniform temperatures and comfort, if it is at the cost of excluding thermal pleasure. Since there are large variations from person to person in terms of physiological and psychological satisfaction, it is hard to find an optimal temperature for everyone in a given space. Laboratory and field data have been collected to define conditions that will be found comfortable for a specified percentage of occupants. There are six primary factors that directly affect thermal comfort that can be grouped in two categories: personal factors – because they are characteristics of the occupants – and environmental factors – which are conditions of the thermal environment. The former are metabolic rate and clothing level, the latter are air temperature, mean radiant temperature, air speed and humidity. Even if all these factors may vary with time, standards usually refer to a steady state to study thermal comfort, just allowing limited temperature variations. People have different metabolic rates that can fluctuate due to activity level and environmental conditions. The ASHRAE 55-2010 Standard defines metabolic rate as the level of transformation of chemical energy into heat and mechanical work by metabolic activities within an organism, usually expressed in terms of unit area of the total body surface. Metabolic rate is expressed in met units, which are defined as follows: 1 met = 58.2 Wm² (18.4 Btuh·ft²), which is equal to the energy produced per unit surface area of an average person seated at rest. The surface area of an average person is 1.8m2 (19ft2). ASHRAE Standard 55 provides a table of met rates for a variety of activities. Some common values are 0.7 met for sleeping, 1.0 met for a seated and quiet position, 1.2–1.4 met for light activities standing, 2.0 met or more for activities that involve movement, walking, lifting heavy loads or operating machinery. For intermittent activity, the Standard states that it is permissible to use a time-weighted average metabolic rate if individuals are performing activities that vary over a period of one hour or less. For longer periods, different metabolic rates must be considered. According to ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, estimating metabolic rates is complex, and for levels above 2 or 3 met – especially if there are various ways of performing such activities – the accuracy is low. Therefore, the Standard is not applicable for activities with an average level higher than 2 met. Met values can also be determined more accurately than the tabulated ones, using an empirical equation that takes into account the rate of respiratory oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Another physiological yet less accurate method is related to the heart rate, since there is a relationship between the latter and oxygen consumption. The Compendium of Physical Activities is used by physicians to record physical activities. It has a different definition of met that is the ratio of the metabolic rate of the activity in question to a resting metabolic rate. As the formulation of the concept is different from the one that ASHRAE uses, these met values cannot be used directly in PMV calculations, but it opens up a new way of quantifying physical activities. Food and drink habits may have an influence on metabolic rates, which indirectly influences thermal preferences. These effects may change depending on food and drink intake. Body shape is another factor that affects thermal comfort. Heat dissipation depends on body surface area. A tall and skinny person has a larger surface-to-volume ratio, can dissipate heat more easily, and can tolerate higher temperatures more than a person with a rounded body shape. The amount of thermal insulation worn by a person has a substantial impact on thermal comfort, because it influences the heat loss and consequently the thermal balance. Layers of insulating clothing prevent heat loss and can either help keep a person warm or lead to overheating. Generally, the thicker the garment is, the greater insulating ability it has. Depending on the type of material the clothing is made out of, air movement and relative humidity can decrease the insulating ability of the material. 1 clo is equal to 0.155 m2·KW (0.88°F·ft2·hBtu). This corresponds to trousers, a long sleeved shirt, and a jacket. Clothing insulation values for other common ensembles or single garments can be found in ASHRAE 55. The air temperature is the average temperature of the air surrounding the occupant, with respect to location and time. According to ASHRAE 55 standard, the spatial average takes into account the ankle, waist and head levels, which vary for seated or standing occupants. The temporal average is based on three-minutes intervals with at least 18 equally spaced points in time. Air temperature is measured with a dry-bulb thermometer and for this reason it is also known as dry-bulb temperature. The radiant temperature is related to the amount of radiant heat transferred from a surface, and it depends on the material's ability to absorb or emit heat, or its emissivity. The mean radiant temperature depends on the temperatures and emissivities of the surrounding surfaces as well as the view factor, or the amount of the surface that is “seen” by the object. So the mean radiant temperature experienced by a person in a room with the sunlight streaming in varies based on how much of their body is in the sun. Air speed is defined as the rate of air movement at a point, without regard to direction. According to ANSIASHRAE Standard 55, it is the average speed of the air surrounding a representative occupant, with respect to location and time. The spatial average is for three heights as defined for average air temperature. For an occupant moving in a space the sensors shall follow the movements of the occupant. The air speed is averaged over an interval not less than one and not greater than three minutes. Variations that occur over a period greater than three minutes shall be treated as multiple different air speeds. Relative humidity (RH) is the ratio of the amount of water vapor in the air to the amount of water vapor that the air could hold at the specific temperature and pressure. While the human body has thermoreceptors in the skin that enable perception of temperature, relative humidity is detected indirectly. Sweating is an effective heat loss mechanism that relies on evaporation from the skin. However at high RH, the air has close to the maximum water vapor that it can hold, so evaporation, and therefore heat loss, is decreased. On the other hand, very dry environments (RH < 20–30%) are also uncomfortable because of their effect on the mucous membranes. The recommended level of indoor humidity is in the range of 30–60% in air conditioned buildings, but new standards such as the adaptive model allow lower and higher humidities, depending on the other factors involved in thermal comfort. Recently, the effects of low relative humidity and high air velocity were tested on humans after bathing. Researchers found that low relative humidity engendered thermal discomfort as well as the sensation of dryness and itching. It is recommended to keep relative humidity levels higher in a bathroom than other rooms in the house for optimal conditions. Skin wetness is defined as ""the proportion of the total skin surface area of the body covered with sweat"". The wetness of skin in different areas also affects perceived thermal comfort. Humidity can increase wetness in different areas of the body, leading to a perception of discomfort. This is usually localized in different parts of the body, and local thermal comfort limits for skin wetness differ by locations of the body. The extremities are much more sensitive to thermal discomfort from wetness than the trunk of the body. Although local thermal discomfort can be caused by wetness, the thermal comfort of the whole body will not be affected by the wetness of certain parts. Various types of apparent temperature have been developed to combine air temperature and air humidity. For higher temperatures, there are quantitative scales, such as the heat index. For lower temperatures, a related interplay was identified only qualitatively: High humidity and low temperatures cause the air to feel chilly. Cold air with high relative humidity ""feels"" colder than dry air of the same temperature because high humidity in cold weather increases the conduction of heat from the body. There has been controversy over why damp cold air feels colder than dry cold air. Some believe it is because when the humidity is high, our skin and clothing become moist and are better conductors of heat, so there is more cooling by conduction. The influence of humidity can be exacerbated with the combined use of fans (forced convection cooling). Many buildings use an HVAC unit to control their thermal environment. Other buildings are naturally ventilated (or would have cross ventilation) and do not rely on mechanical systems to provide thermal comfort. Depending on the climate, this can drastically reduce energy consumption. It is sometimes seen as a risk, though, since indoor temperatures can be too extreme if the building is poorly designed. Properly designed, naturally ventilated buildings keep indoor conditions within the range where opening windows and using fans in the summer, and wearing extra clothing in the winter, can keep people thermally comfortable. There are several different models or indices that can be used to assess thermal comfort conditions indoors as described below. The PMVPPD model was developed by P.O. Fanger using heat-balance equations and empirical studies about skin temperature to define comfort. Standard thermal comfort surveys ask subjects about their thermal sensation on a seven-point scale from cold (−3) to hot (+3). Fanger's equations are used to calculate the predicted mean vote (PMV) of a group of subjects for a particular combination of air temperature, mean radiant temperature, relative humidity, air speed, metabolic rate, and clothing insulation. PMV equal to zero is representing thermal neutrality, and the comfort zone is defined by the combinations of the six parameters for which the PMV is within the recommended limits (−0.5 < PMV < +0.5). Although predicting the thermal sensation of a population is an important step in determining what conditions are comfortable, it is more useful to consider whether or not people will be satisfied. Fanger developed another equation to relate the PMV to the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD). This relation was based on studies that surveyed subjects in a chamber where the indoor conditions could be precisely controlled. The PMVPPD model is applied globally but does not directly take into account the adaptation mechanisms and outdoor thermal conditions. ASHRAE Standard 55-2017 uses the PMV model to set the requirements for indoor thermal conditions. It requires that at least 80% of the occupants be satisfied. The CBE Thermal Comfort Tool for ASHRAE 55 allows users to input the six comfort parameters to determine whether a certain combination complies with ASHRAE 55. The results are displayed on a psychrometric or a temperature-relative humidity chart and indicate the ranges of temperature and relative humidity that will be comfortable with the given the values input for the remaining four parameters. The PMVPPD model has a low prediction accuracy. Using the world largest thermal comfort field survey database, the accuracy of PMV in predicting occupant's thermal sensation was only 34%, meaning that the thermal sensation is correctly predicted one out of three times. The PPD was overestimating subject's thermal unacceptability outside the thermal neutrality ranges (-1≤PMV≤1). The PMVPPD accuracy varies strongly between ventilation strategies, building types and climates. ASHRAE 55 2013 accounts for air speeds above 0.2 metres per second (0.66fts) separately than the baseline model. Because air movement can provide direct cooling to people, particularly if they are not wearing much clothing, higher temperatures can be more comfortable than the PMV model predicts. Air speeds up to 0.8ms (2.6fts) are allowed without local control, and 1.2ms is possible with local control. This elevated air movement increases the maximum temperature for an office space in the summer to 30°C from 27.5°C (86.0–81.5°F). ""Virtual Energy for Thermal Comfort"" is the amount of energy that will be required to make a non-air-conditioned building relatively as comfortable as one with air-conditioning. This is based on the assumption that the home will eventually install air-conditioning or heating. Passive design improves thermal comfort in a building, thus reducing demand for heating or cooling. In many developing countries, however, most occupants do not currently heat or cool, due to economic constraints, as well as climate conditions which border lines comfort conditions such as cold winter nights in Johannesburg (South Africa) or warm summer days in San Jose, Costa Rica. At the same time, as incomes rise, there is a strong tendency to introduce cooling and heating systems. If we recognize and reward passive design features that improve thermal comfort today, we diminish the risk of having to install HVAC systems in the future, or we at least ensure that such systems will be smaller and less frequently used. Or in case the heating or cooling system is not installed due to high cost, at least people should not suffer from discomfort indoors. To provide an example, in San Jose, Costa Rica, if a house were being designed with high level of glazing and small opening sizes, the internal temperature would easily rise above 30°C (86°F) and natural ventilation would not be enough to remove the internal heat gains and solar gains. This is why Virtual Energy for Comfort is important. World Bank's assessment tool the EDGE software (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) illustrates the potential issues with discomfort in buildings and has created the concept of Virtual Energy for Comfort which provides for a way to present potential thermal discomfort. This approach is used to award for design solutions which improves thermal comfort even in a fully free running building. Despite the inclusion of requirements for overheating in CIBSE, overcooling has not been assessed. However, overcooling can be an issue, mainly in the developing world, for example in cities such as Lima (Peru), Bogota, and Delhi, where cooler indoor temperatures can occur frequently. This may be a new area for research and design guidance for reduction of discomfort. ASHRAE 55-2017 defines the Cooling Effect (CE) at elevated air speed (above 0.2 metres per second (0.66fts)) as the value that, when subtracted from both the air temperature and the mean radiant temperature, yields the same SET value under still air (0.1ms) as in the first SET calculation under elevated air speed. The CE can be used to determine the PMV adjusted for an environment with elevated air speed using the adjusted temperature, the adjusted radiant temperature and still air (0.2 metres per second (0.66fts)). Where the adjusted temperatures are equal to the original air and mean radiant temperatures minus the CE. Avoiding local thermal discomfort, whether caused by a vertical air temperature difference between the feet and the head, by an asymmetric radiant field, by local convective cooling (draft), or by contact with a hot or cold floor, is essential to providing acceptable thermal comfort. People are generally more sensitive to local discomfort when their thermal sensation is cooler than neutral, while they are less sensitive to it when their body is warmer than neutral. Large differences in the thermal radiation of the surfaces surrounding a person may cause local discomfort or reduce acceptance of the thermal conditions. ASHRAE Standard 55 sets limits on the allowable temperature differences between various surfaces. Because people are more sensitive to some asymmetries than others, for example that of a warm ceiling versus that of hot and cold vertical surfaces, the limits depend on which surfaces are involved. The ceiling is not allowed to be more than +5°C (9.0°F) warmer, whereas a wall may be up to +23°C (41°F) warmer than the other surfaces. While air movement can be pleasant and provide comfort in some circumstances, it is sometimes unwanted and causes discomfort. This unwanted air movement is called ""draft"" and is most prevalent when the thermal sensation of the whole body is cool. People are most likely to feel a draft on uncovered body parts such as their head, neck, shoulders, ankles, feet, and legs, but the sensation also depends on the air speed, air temperature, activity, and clothing. Floors that are too warm or too cool may cause discomfort, depending on footwear. ASHRAE 55 recommends that floor temperatures stay in the range of 19–29°C (66–84°F) in spaces where occupants will be wearing lightweight shoes. Standard effective temperature (SET) is a model of human response to the thermal environment. Developed by A.P. Gagge and accepted by ASHRAE in 1986, it is also referred to as the Pierce Two-Node model. Its calculation is similar to PMV because it is a comprehensive comfort index based on heat-balance equations that incorporates the personal factors of clothing and metabolic rate. Its fundamental difference is it takes a two-node method to represent human physiology in measuring skin temperature and skin wettedness. The SET index is defined as the equivalent dry bulb temperature of an isothermal environment at 50% relative humidity in which a subject, while wearing clothing standardized for activity concerned, would have the same heat stress (skin temperature) and thermoregulatory strain (skin wettedness) as in the actual test environment. Research has tested the model against experimental data and found it tends to overestimate skin temperature and underestimate skin wettedness. Fountain and Huizenga (1997) developed a thermal sensation prediction tool that computes SET. The SET index can also be calculated using either the CBE Thermal Comfort Tool for ASHRAE 55, the Python package pythermalcomfort, or the R package comf. The adaptive model is based on the idea that outdoor climate influences indoor comfort because humans can adapt to different temperatures during different times of the year. The adaptive hypothesis predicts that contextual factors, such as having access to environmental controls, and past thermal history can influence building occupants' thermal expectations and preferences. Numerous researchers have conducted field studies worldwide in which they survey building occupants about their thermal comfort while taking simultaneous environmental measurements. Analyzing a database of results from 160 of these buildings revealed that occupants of naturally ventilated buildings accept and even prefer a wider range of temperatures than their counterparts in sealed, air-conditioned buildings because their preferred temperature depends on outdoor conditions. These results were incorporated in the ASHRAE 55-2004 standard as the adaptive comfort model. The adaptive chart relates indoor comfort temperature to prevailing outdoor temperature and defines zones of 80% and 90% satisfaction. The ASHRAE-55 2010 Standard introduced the prevailing mean outdoor temperature as the input variable for the adaptive model. It is based on the arithmetic average of the mean daily outdoor temperatures over no fewer than 7 and no more than 30 sequential days prior to the day in question. It can also be calculated by weighting the temperatures with different coefficients, assigning increasing importance to the most recent temperatures. In case this weighting is used, there is no need to respect the upper limit for the subsequent days. In order to apply the adaptive model, there should be no mechanical cooling system for the space, occupants should be engaged in sedentary activities with metabolic rates of 1–1.3 met, and a prevailing mean temperature of 10–33.5°C (50.0–92.3°F). This model applies especially to occupant-controlled, natural-conditioned spaces, where the outdoor climate can actually affect the indoor conditions and so the comfort zone. In fact, studies by de Dear and Brager showed that occupants in naturally ventilated buildings were tolerant of a wider range of temperatures. This is due to both behavioral and physiological adjustments, since there are different types of adaptive processes. ASHRAE Standard 55-2010 states that differences in recent thermal experiences, changes in clothing, availability of control options, and shifts in occupant expectations can change people's thermal responses. Adaptive models of thermal comfort are implemented in other standards, such as European EN 15251 and ISO 7730 standard. While the exact derivation methods and results are slightly different from the ASHRAE 55 adaptive standard, they are substantially the same. A larger difference is in applicability. The ASHRAE adaptive standard only applies to buildings without mechanical cooling installed, while EN15251 can be applied to mixed-mode buildings, provided the system is not running. There are basically three categories of thermal adaptation, namely: behavioral, physiological, and psychological. An individual's comfort level in a given environment may change and adapt over time due to psychological factors. Subjective perception of thermal comfort may be influenced by the memory of previous experiences. Habituation takes place when repeated exposure moderates future expectations, and responses to sensory input. This is an important factor in explaining the difference between field observations and PMV predictions (based on the static model) in naturally ventilated buildings. In these buildings, the relationship with the outdoor temperatures has been twice as strong as predicted. Psychological adaptation is subtly different in the static and adaptive models. Laboratory tests of the static model can identify and quantify non-heat transfer (psychological) factors that affect reported comfort. The adaptive model is limited to reporting differences (called psychological) between modeled and reported comfort. Thermal comfort as a ""condition of mind"" is defined in psychological terms. Among the factors that affect the condition of mind (in the laboratory) are a sense of control over the temperature, knowledge of the temperature and the appearance of the (test) environment. A thermal test chamber that appeared residential ""felt"" warmer than one which looked like the inside of a refrigerator. The body has several thermal adjustment mechanisms to survive in drastic temperature environments. In a cold environment the body utilizes vasoconstriction; which reduces blood flow to the skin, skin temperature and heat dissipation. In a warm environment, vasodilation will increase blood flow to the skin, heat transport, and skin temperature and heat dissipation. If there is an imbalance despite the vasomotor adjustments listed above, in a warm environment sweat production will start and provide evaporative cooling. If this is insufficient, hyperthermia will set in, body temperature may reach 40°C (104°F), and heat stroke may occur. In a cold environment, shivering will start, involuntarily forcing the muscles to work and increasing the heat production by up to a factor of 10. If equilibrium is not restored, hypothermia can set in, which can be fatal. Long-term adjustments to extreme temperatures, of a few days to six months, may result in cardiovascular and endocrine adjustments. A hot climate may create increased blood volume, improving the effectiveness of vasodilation, enhanced performance of the sweat mechanism, and the readjustment of thermal preferences. In cold or underheated conditions, vasoconstriction can become permanent, resulting in decreased blood volume and increased body metabolic rate. In naturally ventilated buildings, occupants take numerous actions to keep themselves comfortable when the indoor conditions drift towards discomfort. Operating windows and fans, adjusting blindsshades, changing clothing, and consuming food and drinks are some of the common adaptive strategies. Among these, adjusting windows is the most common. Those occupants who take these sorts of actions tend to feel cooler at warmer temperatures than those who do not. The behavioral actions significantly influence energy simulation inputs, and researchers are developing behavior models to improve the accuracy of simulation results. For example, there are many window-opening models that have been developed to date, but there is no consensus over the factors that trigger window opening. People might adapt to seasonal heat by becoming more nocturnal, doing physical activity and even conducting business at night. The thermal sensitivity of an individual is quantified by the descriptor FS, which takes on higher values for individuals with lower tolerance to non-ideal thermal conditions. This group includes pregnant women, the disabled, as well as individuals whose age is below fourteen or above sixty, which is considered the adult range. Existing literature provides consistent evidence that sensitivity to hot and cold surfaces usually declines with age. There is also some evidence of a gradual reduction in the effectiveness of the body in thermo-regulation after the age of sixty. This is mainly due to a more sluggish response of the counteraction mechanisms in lower parts of the body that are used to maintain the core temperature of the body at ideal values. Seniors prefer warmer temperatures than young adults (76 vs 72 degrees F or 24.4 vs 22.2 Celsius). Situational factors include the health, psychological, sociological, and vocational activities of the persons. While thermal comfort preferences between sexes seem to be small, there are some average differences. Studies have found males on average report discomfort due to rises in temperature much earlier than females. Males on average also estimate higher levels of their sensation of discomfort than females. One recent study tested males and females in the same cotton clothing, performing mental jobs while using a dial vote to report their thermal comfort to the changing temperature. Many times, females preferred higher temperatures than males. But while females tend to be more sensitive to temperatures, males tend to be more sensitive to relative-humidity levels. An extensive field study was carried out in naturally ventilated residential buildings in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. This investigation explored the sexes thermal sensitivity to the indoor environment in non-air-conditioned residential buildings. Multiple hierarchical regression for categorical moderator was selected for data analysis; the result showed that as a group females were slightly more sensitive than males to the indoor air temperatures, whereas, under thermal neutrality, it was found that males and females have similar thermal sensation. In different areas of the world, thermal comfort needs may vary based on climate. In China the climate has hot humid summers and cold winters, causing a need for efficient thermal comfort. Energy conservation in relation to thermal comfort has become a large issue in China in the last several decades due to rapid economic and population growth. Researchers are now looking into ways to heat and cool buildings in China for lower costs and also with less harm to the environment. In tropical areas of Brazil, urbanization is creating urban heat islands (UHI). These are urban areas that have risen over the thermal comfort limits due to a large influx of people and only drop within the comfortable range during the rainy season. Urban heat islands can occur over any urban city or built-up area with the correct conditions. In the hot, humid region of Saudi Arabia, the issue of thermal comfort has been important in mosques, because they are very large open buildings that are used only intermittently (very busy for the noon prayer on Fridays) it is hard to ventilate them properly. The large size requires a large amount of ventilation, which requires a lot of energy since the buildings are used only for short periods of time. Temperature regulation in mosques is a challenge due to the intermittent demand, leading to many mosques being either too hot or too cold. The stack effect also comes into play due to their large size and creates a large layer of hot air above the people in the mosque. New designs have placed the ventilation systems lower in the buildings to provide more temperature control at ground level. New monitoring steps are also being taken to improve efficiency. The concept of thermal comfort is closely related to thermal stress. This attempts to predict the impact of solar radiation, air movement, and humidity for military personnel undergoing training exercises or athletes during competitive events. Several thermal stress indices have been proposed, such as the Predicted Heat Strain (PHS) or the humidex. Generally, humans do not perform well under thermal stress. People's performances under thermal stress is about 11% lower than their performance at normal thermal wet conditions. Also, human performance in relation to thermal stress varies greatly by the type of task which the individual is completing. Some of the physiological effects of thermal heat stress include increased blood flow to the skin, sweating, and increased ventilation. The PHS model, developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) committee, allows the analytical evaluation of the thermal stress experienced by a working subject in a hot environment. It describes a method for predicting the sweat rate and the internal core temperature that the human body will develop in response to the working conditions. The PHS is calculated as a function of several physical parameters, consequently it makes it possible to determine which parameter or group of parameters should be modified, and to what extent, in order to reduce the risk of physiological strains. The PHS model does not predict the physiological response of an individual subject, but only considers standard subjects in good health and fit for the work they perform. The PHS can be determined using either the Python package pythermalcomfort or the R package comf. The factors affecting thermal comfort were explored experimentally in the 1970s. Many of these studies led to the development and refinement of ASHRAE Standard 55 and were performed at Kansas State University by Ole Fanger and others. Perceived comfort was found to be a complex interaction of these variables. It was found that the majority of individuals would be satisfied by an ideal set of values. As the range of values deviated progressively from the ideal, fewer and fewer people were satisfied. This observation could be expressed statistically as the percent of individuals who expressed satisfaction by comfort conditions and the predicted mean vote (PMV). This approach was challenged by the adaptive comfort model, developed from the ASHRAE 884 project, which revealed that occupants were comfortable in a broader range of temperatures. This research is applied to create Building Energy Simulation (BES) programs for residential buildings. Residential buildings in particular can vary much more in thermal comfort than public and commercial buildings. This is due to their smaller size, the variations in clothing worn, and different uses of each room. The main rooms of concern are bathrooms and bedrooms. Bathrooms need to be at a temperature comfortable for a human with or without clothing. Bedrooms are of importance because they need to accommodate different levels of clothing and also different metabolic rates of people asleep or awake. Discomfort hours is a common metric used to evaluate the thermal performance of a space. Thermal comfort research in clothing is currently being done by the military. New air-ventilated garments are being researched to improve evaporative cooling in military settings. Some models are being created and tested based on the amount of cooling they provide. In the last twenty years, researchers have also developed advanced thermal comfort models that divide the human body into many segments, and predict local thermal discomfort by considering heat balance. This has opened up a new arena of thermal comfort modeling that aims at heatingcooling selected body parts. Another area of study is the hue-heat hypothesis that states that an environment with warm colors (red, orange yellow hues) will feel warmer in terms of temperature and comfort, while an environment with cold colors (blue, green hues) will feel cooler. The hue-heat hypothesis has both been investigated scientifically and ingrained in popular culture in the terms warm and cold colors  Whenever the studies referenced tried to discuss the thermal conditions for different groups of occupants in one room, the studies ended up simply presenting comparisons of thermal comfort satisfaction based on the subjective studies. No study tried to reconcile the different thermal comfort requirements of different types of occupants who compulsorily must stay in one room. Therefore, it looks to be necessary to investigate the different thermal conditions required by different groups of occupants in hospitals to reconcile their different requirements in this concept. To reconcile the differences in the required thermal comfort conditions it is recommended to test the possibility of using different ranges of local radiant temperature in one room via a suitable mechanical system. Although different researches are undertaken on thermal comfort for patients in hospitals, it is also necessary to study the effects of thermal comfort conditions on the quality and the quantity of healing for patients in hospitals. There are also original researches that show the link between thermal comfort for staff and their levels of productivity, but no studies have been produced individually in hospitals in this field. Therefore, research for coverage and methods individually for this subject is recommended. Also research in terms of cooling and heating delivery systems for patients with low levels of immune-system protection (such as HIV patients, burned patients, etc.) are recommended. There are important areas, which still need to be focused on including thermal comfort for staff and its relation with their productivity, using different heating systems to prevent hypothermia in the patient and to improve the thermal comfort for hospital staff simultaneously. Finally, the interaction between people, systems and architectural design in hospitals is a field in which require further work needed to improve the knowledge of how to design buildings and systems to reconcile many conflicting factors for the people occupying these buildings. Personal comfort systems (PCS) refer to devices or systems which heat or cool a building occupant personally. This concept is best appreciated in contrast to central HVAC systems which have uniform temperature settings for extensive areas. Personal comfort systems include fans and air diffusers of various kinds (e.g. desk fans, nozzles and slot diffusers, overhead fans, high-volume low-speed fans etc.) and personalized sources of radiant or conductive heat (footwarmers, legwarmers, hot water bottles etc.). PCS has the potential to satisfy individual comfort requirements much better than current HVAC systems, as interpersonal differences in thermal sensation due to age, sex, body mass, metabolic rate, clothing and thermal adaptation can amount to an equivalent temperature variation of 2–5K, which is impossible for a central, uniform HVAC system to cater to. Besides, research has shown that the perceived ability to control one's thermal environment tends to widen one's range of tolerable temperatures. Traditionally, PCS devices have been used in isolation from one another. However, it has been proposed by Andersen et al. (2016) that a network of PCS devices which generate well-connected microzones of thermal comfort, and report real-time occupant information and respond to programmatic actuation requests (e.g. a party, a conference, a concert etc.) can combine with occupant-aware building applications to enable new methods of comfort maximization.",Normal

"Konstantin Shvedchikov (1884–1952) was a Soviet official who served as the head of Sovkino's board of directors from 1926 to 1929. Following this post he was assigned to other state institutions which were not related to film industry. Shvedchikov was born in 1884. In 1926 he was appointed head of the Sovkino which was a state-owned joint-stock company which oversaw the film production and other related activities and controlled film distribution in the Russian Republic. During his tenure the number of films produced in the Soviet Union increased, and the share of the foreign films screened was also improved. He was replaced by Martemyan Ryutin as the head of Sovkino. However, Ryutin was removed from the office soon, and Shvedchikov temporarily headed the administrative unit of the Sovkino for a while. Then Shvedchikov headed the All-Russian Association of Resorts. During World War II he was the director of the state reserves of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Following his retirement like other old Bolsheviks Shvedchikov was given by the state an apartment in the Government House on Bersenevskaya embankment in Moscow. He died in 1952 and was buried at Moscow's Novodevichy cemetery. Shvedchikov was the recipient of the Order of the Red Banner of Labour.",Normal

"The MacGregor 25 is an American trailerable sailboat that was designed by Roger MacGregor and first built in 1973. From the start of production until 1980, it was sold as the Venture 25. The boat was built by MacGregor Yacht Corporation in the United States between 1973 and 1987, but it is now out of production. During its 14-year production run 7,000 examples were completed. The MacGregor 25 is a small recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a fractional sloop masthead sloop rig, a transom-hung rudder and a fixed stub keel with a centerboard. It displaces 2,100lb (953kg) and carries 625lb (283kg) of ballast. Starting in 1980, a number of boats were built with a masthead sloop rig and known as the MacGregor 25 MH. The boat has a draft of 5.67ft (1.73m) with the centreboard extended and 1.50ft (0.46m) with it retracted, allowing beaching or ground transportation on a trailer. The boat is normally fitted with a small 3 to 6hp (2 to 4kW) outboard motor for docking and maneuvering. The design has sleeping accommodation for five people, with a double ""V""-berth in the bow cabin, a straight settee in the main cabin on the port side and drop-down dinette table on the starboard side that forms a double berth. The galley is located on the port side just forward of the companionway ladder. The galley is equipped with a two-burner stove and a sink. The head is located just aft of the bow cabin on the starboard side. Cabin headroom is 57in (145cm). The masthead rigged version has a PHRF racing average handicap of 231, with a high of 246 and low of 222. All models have a hull speed of 6.43kn (11.91kmh). In a 2010 review, Steve Henkel wrote, ""This popular design started out as the Venture 25 in 1973, and in 1981 became the MacGregor 25, with no major changes to the design. Over the years there was a choice of two sailplans, either a three quarters fractional rig or a masthead rig ... The boat is lightly built and has ample sail area (note the higher SAD versus comps) so she will have a good turn of speed if properly equipped and tuned."" The MacGregor 25 was inducted into the now-defunct Sail America American Sailboat Hall of Fame in 2000. In honoring the design, the hall cited, ""Henry Ford is often credited with bringing the automobile to the common man. Roger MacGregor, a one-time Ford employee, may well be credited with doing the same thing for the cruising sailboat. The popular MacGregor 25 was the flagship of his line for 14 years. With a swinging keel - a MacGregor invention - that made transporting and launching the boat a snap, and a price that hovered around the cost of a new car, the MacGregor 25 opened up coastal and inland sailing to thousands.""

"The Industrial Trust Building, located at 111 Westminster Street or 55 Kennedy Plaza in downtown Providence, Rhode Island, was built in 1928 as the Industrial Trust Co. Building, and was designed by the New York firm of Walker & Gillette. At 428 feet (130m) with 26 floors, it is the tallest building in Providence and the state of Rhode Island, and the 28th tallest in New England; when it was completed it stood several stories higher than the recently finished Biltmore Hotel nearby. Known through the years as the ""Fleet Bank Tower"", the ""Bank of America Building"", and, most recently, ""111 Westminster"", locally it is commonly referred to as the ""Superman Building"", supposedly because of its visual similarity to the headquarters of the Daily Planet newspaper from as represented in The Adventures of Superman TV series of the 1950s. The building has been vacant since Bank of America moved out in April 2013. An estimate in 2016 was that it would take $115 million to rehabilitate the building. Requests for public financing were rejected in 2017. Before the current building was erected, the site was the location of the six-story Butler Exchange Building. Located at 55 Exchange Place and constructed in 1872, the land was purportedly deeded by the heirs of the original Samuel Butler. Due to address changes across the city, by 1913 it bore the address 123 Westminster. The 1872 building housed the Rhode Island Commercial School which was purchased and merged into Bryant & Stratton College in 1916, the forerunner of Bryant University. It housed many retail businesses such as Dodge and Camfield, importers and grocers; A. & L. Tirocchi Gowns; and the Waite Auto Supply Company. The Providence Ladies' Sanitary Gymnasium was also a tenant. After a devastating fire, the Butler Exchange Building was demolished in 1925, to make way for a new tower. Though the community did not like the plans for the building because of its height, construction materials, and design Commissioned in 1925 by the Industrial Trust Company – founded in 1886 by Samuel P. Colt – the current building was constructed in 1927-1928. during the inter-war boom period as the Industrial Trust Tower. Designed in the Art Deco style popular at the time, the building opened for tenants on October 1, 1928. It was renamed the Fleet Bank Tower when Industrial Trust changed its name to Fleet Financial Group in 1982. It remained Fleet's headquarters until Fleet merged with Shawmut National Bank in 1995 and moved to Boston. Fleet retained ownership of the building even after it merged with BankBoston as FleetBoston Financial in 1998. In 2004, FleetBoston Financial was acquired by Bank of America, and the building became the Bank of America Building. In 2008, shortly before the Great Recession, the building was purchased by High Rock Development of Massachusetts for $33.2 million. Bank of America was the building's sole tenant, and utilized about half the building. Bank of America invested $7 million in a new sprinkler and fire safety system. In 2012, Bank of America, still the sole tenant, decided not to renew its lease. The bank vacated the building, leaving it empty. High Rock's request for public funds to redevelop the building was turned down. State taxpayers, still smarting from the controversial money-losing loan to 38 Studios in 2012, were in no mood to offer public funding or tax credits. In 2016, it was estimated that at least $115 million would be needed to rehabilitate the building. In 2013, High Rock sued Bank of America for millions of dollars, claiming that the bank had neglected upkeep of the building and left it in a deteriorating state. The building is pockmarked with gaps of missing limestone, and is surrounded by scaffolding to prevent injuries to passers-by. High Rock brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, claiming that the bank failed to meet its repair and replacement obligations under a long-term lease, rendering the building unleasable. High Rock sought up to $54 million in damages. The bank brought a counterclaim seeking recovery of monies spent removing furniture from the building after the lease expired. The counterclaim was subsequently dismissed by the court (Smith, J.), and the case was scheduled for trial in May 2017. Shortly after jury empanelment, the bank settled the suit on confidential terms. The building was a steel-frame structure sheathed in Indiana limestone, with Deer Isle granite at its base. The tower was advertised as ""A Business Building for Building Business"". It has six wings stemming from a central tower. The skyscraper was designed in the stepped-back style, which originated in Manhattan, New York City in response to the 1916 zoning law which sought to increase the amount of air and light in downtown Manhattan, but when this building was on the drawing board in late 1925 or early 1926, very few building of this type had been built elsewhere in the U.S. There were no such zoning restrictions in Providence, nevertheless, New York architects Walker & Gillette chose to include the innovative symmetrical stepped massing, with the assistance of local architect George Frederick Hall of Martin & Hall. The base and the trim at the base's top were built to match the cornice height of existing adjacent (now gone) four-story buildings. It was among the tallest buildings in New England when completed, and ranked third after its construction to the 1919 Travelers Tower (at 527 feet161 m) in Hartford, Connecticut, and the 1915 expansion of the Custom House Tower, at 496 feet (151m), in Boston. The majority of relief art is found on the cornice of the tower's base, where 22 frames depict scenes of Native American and Colonist interaction and stages of Industrialization alongside four seals, and four eagles. Dual street-level staircases rise at the east and west ends of a stately columned grand hall, which is three stories high and runs the length of the building; it contains large windows that overlook Kennedy Plaza and the Westminster Arcade. The balcony level of the grand hall contains the lobby and entrance to an intimate ballroom with marble fireplaces and brass chandeliers. The 26th floor hosted the executive office of Industrial Trust Company. The suite contains secretary staff common areas, dining room and offices. A stairway leads to the higher north-face 29th level private 'dining car' or Gondola room designed to resemble the gondola of an airship; the room contains a wine closet and dark leather details. A peregrine falcon nest box is located in the area. The 28th and 29th floors contain a gravity water-service system; two large tanks on these levels feed the building. The 29th floor contains a lavatory for service to the Gondola rooms and adjoining balconies. In the basement is a vault, designed by Frederick S. Holmes that houses small and large items, supplied with storage areas for client possessions such as fine rugs. The vault has a 17-ton (15.5 tonne) door. The metal doors and trim were manufactured by Dahlstrom Metallic Door Company of Jamestown, New York. Some of the street-level doors possess relief art of eagles in brass. The original glass of the beacon was of a green hue, and topped with a decorative globe, surrounded by a circle of stone eagles weighing 7.5 tons (6.8 tonnes). In 1932, it was damaged and repaired after a lightning strike. This architectural feature was removed in 1950 after one eagle fell to the street in 1930. Floors 5, 12, 14, 17, 18, 26 and 30 recede to form the building's distinctive profile. From nightfall until midnight, the building's peak is traditionally lit a bright blue with varying red and green at Christmas and Valentine's Day. The building has remained relatively unchanged over the years with the exception of the lobby, the upper windows and the two story turret tower and light beacon. Due to its vacant occupancy the exterior lights illuminating the superstructure are not lit. In 1973, the beacon tower was turned off for the first time since 1928 to conserve energy. The building has remained relatively unchanged through the years. The latest update (2007) was tenant Bank of America's new fire suppression systems, which cost $7 million. In 2011, media reports speculated that Bank of America, the building's last tenant, would move out at the end of its ten-year lease; which eventually led to the bank's 2012 announcement that it would vacate the space the coming year. In March 2013, Bank of America officially ceased operations at the building leaving it unoccupied. The Providence nighttime skyline was subsequently affected as the exterior nighttime lighting used to illuminate the upper structure was shut off, with the exception of the peak light. Subsequently, new owner High Rock Development - which purchased the building in 2008 for $33 million - proposed to convert the building into mostly luxury apartments, involving $80 million in tax credits from the State. This plan was rejected and the State has applied to move some of their Health and Human Services offices into the now vacant property. High Rock Development has since offered a four-year plan that would require $40 million in new funding for the rehabilitation of the tower into a mix of uses that include retail, business and 285 residential units. The former and new financing proposals were met with mixed reaction with several individuals noting High Rock Development has $200 million available to put towards the rehab effort but has declined to do so. In October 2022, the Providence City Council voted to approve a $29 million tax deal for the rehabilitation effort. An independent appraisal was completed in 2012, and in 2014 the Providence group Scotti and Associates used that appraisal to decide that the building had ""no value."" In December 2017, Paolino Properties and Gilbane Development announced a plan that would involve demolishing the building and replacing it with a new 36-story building. This is one of several plans being pitched to Hasbro for a new headquarters in downtown Providence.",Normal

"Gene silencing pesticides are pesticides that use gene silencing, and RNA interference (RNAi) in particular to target individual species while leaving other species unharmed. In 1998, it was found that double-stranded RNA, injected to worms influenced the natural gene sequence in such a way that it was silenced. Equally surprising was that the genes were also silenced when the worms ingested the dsRNA. Steven Whyard, working for CSIRO Entomology at that time, then also tried it with insects. To his surprise, this also worked, and they just invented something that had huge implications. They then patented the technology and by 2006, it was used in pesticides. Two articles were then also published that confirmed that the effect was powerful enough to protect plants from pests. Besides directly killing the pests by poisoning the food of insects with RNAi, there are also other ways on how gene silencing pesticides can kill a pest. For example, a research study by Michael Scharf found that it was possible to eradicate termites by using RNAi which disables the Hex-2-gene; this transforms worker termites into soldier termites. A colony with too many soldier termites (apparently more than about 10%) does not have enough remaining worker termites to adequately feed the colony.",Normal

"William Cockin (baptised 1736 – 1801) was an English schoolmaster and versatile author. The son of Marmaduke Cockin (1712–1754), he was born at Burton-in-Kendal, Westmorland. His father was a schoolmaster. After time spent as a teacher in schools in London, Cockin was in 1764 appointed writing-master and accountant to Lancaster Grammar School, a post he held for twenty years. He was then for eight years at John Blanchard's Nottingham Academy. Cockin retired to Kendal. He was a friend of George Romney the painter, and he died at Romney's house in Kendal, on 30 May 1801, aged 65. He was buried at Burton-in-Kendal. Among Cockin's friends was the Rev. Thomas Wilson of Clitheroe, and Peter Romney, brother of George, was a correspondent in the later 1760s. Other associates were John Dawson, and Rev. John James D.D., of Arthuret. Cockin's works included: Cockin contributed to the Philosophical Transactions a paper An Account of an Extraordinary Appearance in a Mist near Lancaster. In 1775 Cockin published The Art of Delivering Written Language; or, An Essay on Reading, dedicated to David Garrick, a work on elocution. In this book Cockin is representative of the 18th-century elocutionary movement, and within elocutionist he is assigned to the ""natural school"". His comment on the prescriptive approach of Thomas Sheridan, a leader of the movement, was that works of elocution might be as much about perceptions of ways of talking as speaking. Cockin noted in particular the connection between modulation in speech and silent reading. He pointed out that in both speech and singing, pauses are used to frame and for emphasis. He took comical mimicry to be a low form, in terms of artistic prestige. His exposition on the topic is now a standard authority for this attitude to imitation and mimesis. Thomas West's Guide to the Lakes, on the English Lake District, first appeared in 1778, and Cockin assisted in its compilation. He edited, anonymously, the second edition in 1780, West having died in 1779, including a preface that discussed the sources used: John Brown's Letter on Keswick, Thomas Gray, Thomas Pennant and Arthur Young. This expanded work and a later edition influenced William Wordsworth's 1810 guide. They contained the Letter on Keswick and Gray's Journal of the Lakes as appendices. Other additions included an engraving of Grasmere, after John Feary; Cockin was also responsible for footnotes, and tables of heights of the mountains.

"Speech and Reality is a book by Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy (1888–1973), German social philosopher and is an English-language introduction to Rosenstock-Huessy’s German-language book, Soziologie. It comprises seven essays that he wrote and revised between 1935 and 1955. Rosenstock-Huessy introduces a new form of social research in which the human subject, as speaker, displaces the subject of orthodox sociology, wherein the subject can be mute. Speech and Reality is an English-language introduction to Rosenstock-Huessy’s Soziologie (sociology) and his method of inquiry for the social sciences, which is based on grammar. Using grammar as a tool, Rosenstock-Huessy describes the preconditions of anarchy, revolution, decadence, and war. John Macquarrie emphasized the importance of Rosenstock-Huessy's language-based methods and Peter Leithart cited the scope of his thinking across the depth and breadth of society. Along with Franz Rosenzweig, Ferdinand Ebner, and Martin Buber, Rosenstock-Huessy is a major contributor to ""speech thinking,"" and it is a central concern of several works of his, perhaps the most important, in English, being Speech and Reality. The basic idea of “speech thinking” is that our reality is not only an object to be espied, but an extension of our powers. And of all the powers which constitute us, it is speech, with its calls and responses, vocatives and imperatives, solicitations and appeals, that enables us to undertake collective action and thereby transform ourselves and the world around us. Speech does not merely describe or denote what exists, it enables us to draw out from ourselves possibilities and realities which are yet unrealized. In place of Descartes’ ""I think therefore I am,"" which is the clarion call to become lords and masters over nature and thereby to treat nature as a great machine subject to our will and our cognitive capacities, Rosenstock-Huessy taught ""I respond, although I will be changed."" This is a formulation, which comes from the recognition that life calls us into ever-fresh tasks and that we never approach urgent things already in full knowledge of an outcome. Being open to speech is being open to the various insights and requests, the urgencies and necessities that are encapsulated in speech. It is the recognition that we are mutual creators of each other and the world around us; that is a reality we cannot avoid, though we can easily fail to see what it involves. That our words become flesh is, in fact a variant of another fact—that we dissolve and resolve again in acts of love. Speech thinking, in other words, stands in the closest relationship to the law of love. Rosenstock-Huessy wrote in Speech and Reality: Whoever speaks believes in the unity of mankind. And he believes that the unity of mankind is not produced by physical or political or economic or racial reasons but by our faith in speech. We all believe in the Holy Ghost, the Oneness above and around our particular way of looking at the world. The individual’s greatest freedom has as its corollary the spirit’s greatest necessity. If all men are bound by one truth, then my-truth makes sense. If it does not, I go mad with my freedom. In Commonweal magazine, John Macquarrie writes about Speech and Reality: The Author believes as did Dilthey before him that social sciences must suffer from being forced into the methodological mold of the natural sciences. Anyone acquainted with the kind of psychology and sociology commonly taught in the United States today could hardly fail to agree, and there is in fact currently a good deal of dissatisfaction with the naturalistic model used in these sciences. But where do we look for a better method? Rosenstock-Huessy suggests that we look to language. Speech is the basic social reality. Grammar, in turn, is the science, which describes and analyzes the structures of language. Hence grammar is the foundation for developing a methodology for the social sciences. It must be added at once that it is not conventional grammar that the author has in mind. The grammar we learn in school and which enables us to reel off conjugations and the like is a grammar which has killed the drama and dignity of living speech. Rosenstock-Huessy has in mind a renewed grammar, a ""higher grammar,"" as he sometimes calls it, which will attend to the nuances of tense and mood, and will see in these the structures of the social reality.... This book could make very helpful contributions toward working out a more human approach to the study of the human phenomenon. Peter Leithart writes on ""The Relevance of Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy"" and his methods: It’s not only the scope that impresses, but the integration. There is a passionate religious impulse behind everything he wrote, and it’s all made immediately, existentially real. But he moves rapidly from the large movements of history down to individual and family experience.",Normal

"""Not If You Were the Last Junkie on Earth"" is a song by American rock band the Dandy Warhols. It was released on June 16, 1997, as the first single from their second studio album, ...The Dandy Warhols Come Down. As documented in the film Dig!, the song is dedicated to the band the Brian Jonestown Massacre, friends and rivals of the Dandy Warhols, who in turn dedicated their own track ""Not If You Were the Last Dandy on Earth"" to them. Frontman Courtney Taylor-Taylor revealed in an interview that the song is also about his girlfriend who he said had become a heroin addict while he was on tour. The song is known for its refrain ""I never thought you'd be a junkie because heroin is so passé"". Because of this, the song has often been erroneously titled ""Heroin Is So Passé"", and the song was later subtitled with this in some markets. The music video for the song, directed by David LaChapelle, features the group ""playing among a troupe of dancing syringes"" and was called an ""arch, playful, taboo-shredding hoot"" by Mojo.

"Poughkeepsie (pəˈkɪpsi pə-KIP-see), officially the Town of Poughkeepsie, is a town in Dutchess County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 United States Census, the population was 45,471. The name is derived from the native term Uppuqui (uːˈpuːki oo-POO-kee) meaning ""lodge-covered"", plus ipis meaning ""little water"", plus ing meaning ""place"", all of which translates to ""the reed-covered lodge by the little water place"", or Uppuqui-ipis-ing. This later evolved into Apokeepsing, then into Poughkeepsing, and finally Poughkeepsie. The area includes a large IBM campus noted for its ongoing development and manufacturing of IBM mainframes. The town was first settled circa 1780 and was part of the Schuyler Patent of 1788. The town of Poughkeepsie was established in 1788 as part of a general organization of towns in the county.

"A joint railway is a railway operating under the control of more than one railway company: those companies very often supplying the traction over the railway. There are many examples of joint railway working in the United Kingdom. The more important ones included: ""Joint railways"" are called terminal railroads in the United States. Most true example of joint railways are in terminal areas, including union stations. Terminal railways are often co-owned by the railroads that connect with them. Among the more prominent joint operations were: The concept of trackage rights is more common than joint railways in the United States. The railroad that owns the track permits trains from another railroad to use the line. The owner railroad normally charges a fee, but sometimes there is no charge because the arrangement results from a merger or sale of a line. For instance, when the Louisville and Nashville Railroad acquired the Monon Railroad a condition of the sale imposed by government regulators was a trackage rights arrangement over the southern part of the Monon for the Milwaukee Road, an agreement that was handed down to successive owners of the Milwaukee Road and finally the Indiana Rail Road. Variations on trackage rights include ""direction running"" agreements between two railroads with parallel lines through an area, usually done to facilitate greater traffic volume. For instance, CSX and NS have a directional-running agreement between downtown Cincinnati, Ohio and nearby Hamilton, where northbound trains generally use NS trackage and southbound trains (with the exception of Amtrak's Cardinal) use CSX tracks. North of Hamilton, NS trains use CSX tracks on a traditional trackage-rights agreement for a two-mile (3km) section.",Normal
"Nathan Clifford Brown (October 13, 1856 – March 20, 1941) was an American ornithologist who was one of the co-founders of the American Ornithologists' Union. Nathan Clifford Brown was born in Portland, Maine on October 13, 1856. He was named after his maternal grandfather, Associate Supreme Court Justice Nathan Clifford, who had also been a U.S. Representative for Maine, an ambassador to Mexico and an attorney general for Democratic President James K. Polk. Brown developed an interest in natural history early in his life. He collected birds and attempted taxidermy several times before entering Bowdoin College in 1873. However, poor health interrupted his studies, and it made it difficult for him to find employment. In 1874, Brown sought Charles Johnson Maynard to study taxidermy, which jump-started his ornithological career. Brown finished his apprenticeship in 1875, and moved back to Portland. Back in Portland, Brown began his work on his ""Catalogue of Birds of Portland and Vicinity"". Starting in 1878, Brown went on collecting trips in the South, specifically Alabama and Texas. Starting in 1903, he would also visit South Carolina. In 1881, he was named curator of ornithology for the Portland Society of Natural History, a position he held until 1889. In all, Brown wrote 104 ornithological titles, mostly published in the Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological Club and in its successor, The Auk. Starting in 1876, he was a corresponding member of the Nuttall Ornithological Club, and in 1883, he was a founding member of the American Ornithologists' Union.",Normal

"Lovat Shinty Club is a shinty club from Kiltarlity, Inverness-shire, Scotland. The club was formed in 1888  and has a healthy rivalry with near neighbours Beauly. The club takes its name from the area within which it plays in and shared this name with the late Second World War hero, Lord Lovat. Founded in 1888, the club has never folded but did merge with Beauly early in the 20th century and won the Camanachd Cup in 191213 as the combined team. After the first war, the team also reached the final in 1925. In 1953 was Lovat's finest hour, achieving the Grand Slam, winning every single competition  they entered at Senior and Junior level, they were the first club to ever achieve this feat. The same set of players had previously won the Celtic Society Cup which was a South District Competition in 1950 and 1951. Despite being close to Inverness, Lovat still maintain two strong teams due to a strong youth policy and the support of the local primary school. The club is always well represented at youth international level. The club hosts the traditional Lovat V Beauly New Year's Day match AKA the Lovat Cup every year. This game attracts the largest crowd for a shinty match outside of the Camanachd Cup final. In November 2007, following Kinlochshiels' draw with Caberfeidh, Lovat became a Marine Harvest Premier Division Team. This was a massive achievement for the Kiltarlity side and was somewhat ahead of schedule given the very young age of the team. However, Lovat's 2008 season in the Premier Division was a hard campaign and the club was eventually relegated having been marooned at the bottom of the league for almost the whole season. The club's first team won North Division One again in 2009, this marked a successful season for the club where its second team had also reached the Sutherland and Strathdearn Cup finals, losing to Fort William on both occasions. Lovat had a successful season in 2010, surviving in the Premier Division and seeing the second team again reach the finals of the Strathdearn and Sutherland. Again, the club faced the same team as opponents, playing Glenurquhart in both games. Lovat lost the Strathdearn but claimed the Sutherland live on BBC Alba. This victory was notable as it was held at the Eilan in Newtonmore, just down the road from the Dell in Kingussie where Lovat had secured a rare point against Kingussie earlier in the day. 2011 saw Lovat play well but never fully extricate themselves from relegation trouble until their final match of the season when a 3–2 win over Kilmallie secured Premier Division shinty for another year. James Gallacher & John MacRitchie stepped down from their roles as co-managers to be replaced by successful second-team manager Allan MacRae. Lovat achieved their highest league placing since their glory days winning the North Division One, with a third-place finish in the 2012 Premiership. On 15 June 2013 Lovat won their first major trophy since 1953 when they won the MacTavish Cup. They also secured a highest ever Premiership finish as runners-up to Newtonmore, and finished the season with the best defensive record in shinty. As well as tasting reserve success in the Strathdearn Cup. They retained the MacTavish Cup in 2014, reinforcing their position as the most successful side in the competition outside the Badenoch giants, Kingussie & Newtonmore, having won the trophy eight times in all. They finished the season in second but pushed Newtonmore much harder than in 2013. In 2015, Lovat had, by recent standards, a poor league season. However, under John Macritchie, they did lift the Camanachd cup, the biggest prize in the game. Kyles Athletic were the opponents this tie was played in Oban. It was a tight contest and finished 2-1 thanks to a Kevin Bartlett double and an Albert Smith medal winning performance from Stuart MacDonald. After this the club went on a run of making 4 of the next 6 Camanachd Cup finals. However on each occasion we’re defeated, twice by Newtonmore during their 4 titles in a row, once by Kinlochshiel on their first ever victory and by Kingussie in a match played at the dell in Kingussie. The junior side had post Covid success winning the 2021 Strathdearn cup on penalties against Newtonmore after being 4-0 down in extra time. Lovat established a ladies team in 2011, which plays in National Division Two. The area had a long tradition of girls playing shinty alongside boys until a certain age, with players leaving the sport. In the 2010s, local talent was corralled by Gillian Currie and Gemma MacKinnon, two Scotland internationalists who had settled in the area, into a first ever Lovat ladies team. Scotland internationalist youngster, Laura Gallacher, also returned to her home club after several years playing for Glengarry.. The club was featured in the ""Swags"" documentary on BBC Alba, Christmas 2013.",Normal
"On October 15, 2008, Michael Mineo was arrested and allegedly sodomized by New York City Police Department (NYPD) officers in the Prospect Park subway station in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York. According to Mineo, the arresting police officers pinned him to the ground, while Richard Kern, one of the officers, pulled down Mineo's pants and sodomized him with a police baton. On December 9, 2008, the Brooklyn District Attorney indicted the three arresting officers and charged them with felonies. Kern was charged with aggravated sexual abuse in the first degree, assault in the first degree, and hindering prosecution. Two other officers — Andrew Morales and Alex Cruz — were charged with hindering prosecution and official misconduct. All three officers were tried and found not guilty of all charges. Michael Mineo was born c. 1984 in either Flatbush or in Dallas, Texas. He is Italian-Puerto Rican. Both of his parents died of drug overdoses when he was around eleven years old. He then moved in with his mother's parents, but they both died by the time he was fourteen. He then moved in with an aunt by marriage and her husband who lived in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Mineo was under indictment on felony assault charges stemming from an unrelated incident for which he was arrested on April 18, 2008. Mineo's defense for his indictment was a legal aid attorney, but following the alleged incident on October 15 he hired a private attorney. In the fall of 2003, Mineo stole his friend's mother's credit cards and placed more than $6,000 on the card. During that time, he left for New York City; soon thereafter he was arrested on marijuana possession and was found to be carrying the stolen credit cards. In 2007, New York City paid out $50,000 to settle two excessive force lawsuits filed against Richard Kern. However, the Civilian Complaint Review Board cleared him of wrongdoing and Kern says the excessive force claims were a ""complete lie"". On October 15, 2008, Michael Mineo was allegedly smoking a marijuana joint outside the Prospect Park station in Flatbush. When approached by police officers, Mineo ran into the train station, jumped the turnstile, but was caught and handcuffed near the token booth. According to the officers, they found no drugs on him, issued him a summons for disorderly conduct, and let him go. According to Mineo, after he was handcuffed and pinned down, Richard Kern pulled down his pants and shoved a police radio antenna into his anus. Mineo later changed his version to a police baton. On October 23, Mineo's attorneys announced the incident and noted that they planned to file a lawsuit against New York City on Mineo's behalf. Speaking before a grand jury in November 2008, Transit Police officer Kevin Maloney testified that police officer Richard Kern jabbed Mineo's buttocks with a police baton, while other witnesses testified that Mineo's bare buttocks were visible and that they heard him screaming: ""Don't shove a walkie  up my ass!"" Mineo later praised the Transit Police officer who had testified on his behalf stating ""I'm really happy he came out and said what he said. He must have felt bad."" Maloney testified that he saw Kern resting his baton on Mineo's left buttock, and he saw half inch to an inch disappear from view. Michael Mineo was hospitalized two times with what sources described as ""rectal tears"" as a result of the assault. This case has drawn parallels to a similar set of circumstances that took place in August 1997, in which NYPD officers assaulted and forcibly sodomized Abner Louima with a broken plunger handle after he was arrested. However, there are differences between the Louima and Mineo situations. Louima was black and his 1997 police attackers were white, whereas Mineo is described as white and Hispanic and the involved police officers are white, black and Hispanic. The NYPD was criticized for not taking Mineo's claims seriously. The accused officers were kept on regular patrol duty for two and half weeks after the incident. The police maintain that they aggressively located records, reviewed hours of videotape, examined MetroCard records, and retained equipment for DNA testing. The trial of the three police officers began on January 22, 2010. The prosecution called Mineo, another police officer who witnessed the incident, a doctor who treated Mineo, and a DNA expert from the medical examiner's office. The defense followed by calling each of the three officers, and a doctor who stated the injuries were not consistent with assault. The defense submitted a video as evidence that supports the argument that Mineo had a pre-existing medical condition. During the jury deliberations, one juror was removed because she misinformed the other jurors regarding past allegations against Kern. The removed juror was replaced with an alternate. After a couple of days of deliberating, the jury found the three police officers not guilty. The jury stated to the judge that they had reasonable doubt regarding the incident.",Normal

His debut album, Here Be Monsters, was nominated for the 2001 Mercury Prize. Since 2007 he has been writing for other artists, including Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Paloma Faith, and has performed with Marianne Faithfull and the Libertines. His music is influenced by Tom Waits, Nick Cave, and Jeff Buckley, among others. Harcourt was born Edward Henry Richard Harcourt-Smith on 14 August 1977, in Wimbledon, London, England. The youngest of three, Harcourt is the son of Maj. Charles Harcourt-Smith of the Life Guards and also a former diplomat, and his wife Sabrina, an art historian. Ed began to study piano at the age of nine and achieved grade 8 when he was 17. He declined the offer to study music, citing ""the idea of having to analyze, dissect and everything  would completely destroy any enjoyment"". Before going solo, Harcourt played the bass and keyboards for Snug, a band formed at school in the mid-1990s by Harcourt, James Deane, Ed Groves and Johnny Lewsley. The band recorded two albums and a handful of singles together before dissolving. In 2000, Harcourt recorded his debut mini-album Maplewood EP straight to a 4-track recorder at Wootton Manor. After signing with Heavenly Records and releasing Maplewood in November 2000, Harcourt recorded his debut studio album Here Be Monsters with producers Gil Norton and Tim Holmes. The album was released in June 2001, and charted on the UK Albums Chart at No. 84. One month after its release, the album was nominated for the 2001 Mercury Prize. He later described the period as ""very strange for me, I was naive, I knew nothing. I was used to making music in my room, so it felt very odd being on stage"". In the US he signed with Capitol Records. Following the non-album single release of the Brian Wilson cover ""Still I Dream of It"" in October 2002, Harcourt recorded and released his second album From Every Sphere in February 2003. The album became his highest-charting release in the UK, peaking at No. 39. The album also performed moderately well across Europe, peaking at No. 6 in Sweden, No. 25 in Norway, and No. 103 in France. From Every Sphere also yielded his highest-charting single to date, ""All of Your Days Will Be Blessed"", at No. 35. A second single, ""Watching the Sun Come Up"", was less successful, peaking at No. 79. After a steady schedule of tour dates in the UK, Harcourt's third album, Strangers, was released in September 2004. The album peaked at No. 57 in the UK and at No. 7 in Sweden, and produced the singles ""This One's for You"", ""Born in the '70s"", and ""Loneliness.""

He was also part of the ensemble that performed the William Blake inspired Songs of Innocence. Harcourt's fourth album The Beautiful Lie was released in June 2006 to generally favourable reviews, with Allmusic describing the album as ""an invigorating and frequently gorgeous affair, essential for old fans and a good place to start for newcomers."" The album was not as successful on the UK charts, peaking at No. 97. The Beautiful Lie was co-produced with Jari Haapalainen, and features contributions from The Magic Numbers, who sing backing vocals on ""Revolution in the Heart""; Graham Coxon, who plays guitar on first single ""Visit from the Dead Dog""; and Ed's wife Gita, who plays violin throughout and sings duet vocals on the track ""Braille"".

In October 2007, Harcourt released the compilation album Until Tomorrow Then: The Best of Ed Harcourt, collecting material from the first seven years of his recording career. With the release he completed his obligations with HeavenlyEMI and the contract was not renewed. As a consequence he stepped away from his solo career as he was ""really bored and sick of myself and my music. I had tried for seven years to make it and break into the mainstream and it didn't happen"". In 2009, Harcourt signed with Dovecote Records in the United States to release The Beautiful Lie stateside, as well as his new EP Russian Roulette which appeared in May of that year.

Two seasons later they gained promotion to the Premier Division, as champions of division one. They then spent the next ten years in the Premier Division, during which time they made their debut in the FA Vase, finishing runners-up twice before being relegated back to Division one at the end of the 1979–80 season. However it just took them one season to gain promotion when they finished as Runners-up in Division one in the 1980–81 season. At the end of the 1984–85 season the club finished bottom of the Premier division, and the club had to be reformed in April of that season, with a new official name of Clanfield (April 1985) Football Club. The reformed club took over from Clanfields place in the Hellenic league and started the 1985–86 season in Division one. The club has since then remained in Division one of the Hellenic league, being placed in Division one West when the league was restructured for the 2000–01 season. During the course of the 2005––06 season floodlights were installed at the ground allowing the club access to the league's floodlight cup competition, further ground enhancements have seen new dug-outs and seats in the main stand. The 2010–11 season saw the club make their debut in the FA Cup losing to Fareham Town in their first ever game in the extra preliminary qualification round. This season also saw the club finish a very creditable fourth place in Division One West, just three points from a second-place finish and subsequent promotion to the Premier Division. In the following seasons since they have finished 8th, 11th, 5th and in 2014–15 in 9th. A series of further ground improvement works are currently ongoing and being undertaken by some very hard working volunteers, these include fencing and a concrete walkway around the ground. Dressing room improvements are in the pipeline too making the Radcot Road ground an even more attractive setting in this tiny West Oxfordshire village. During the pre-season of 2015–16 the club hosted National Conference outfit Eastleigh at Radcot Road, with the professional side running out 4-0 winners. A good evening was enjoyed by all in attendance. Season 2015–16 was one of transition in terms of the senior playing side as manager Peter Osborne started to focus more on youth development. The club has some very talented young players coming on the scene and this was reflected quite a bit in the results and eventual finish in the table of 3rd from the bottom. Hopefully these lads will push on and with others coming through a bright future lays ahead. The summer of 2016 saw a few changes off the field as the club entered a period of transition. Long serving Chairman John Osborne stood down along with his wife Monica and long serving groundsman Geoff Collet retired.

"On November 6, 2001, the owners of the 30 teams in Major League Baseball (MLB) voted 28–2 to eliminate two teams for the 2002 season. The two teams expected to be eliminated, the Minnesota Twins and the Montreal Expos, cast the dissenting votes. According to Commissioner Bud Selig, the decision was made due to economic reasons, as ""the teams to be contracted  a long record of failing to generate enough revenues to operate a viable major league franchise."" Also factoring into the contraction plan was the two teams' inability to fund the construction of new ballparks to replace the outdated Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and Olympic Stadium. The contraction plan fell through due to a court injunction compelling the Twins to honor their lease with the Metrodome, as well as challenges by the players' labor union, the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA). The Expos were later purchased by Major League Baseball. The Twins would eventually secure funding for a new stadium that opened in 2010, while the Expos relocated to Washington, D.C. in 2005 and were re-branded the Washington Nationals, later being purchased by Ted Lerner and moving to a new stadium of their own. If the plan had gone through, it would have been the first contraction by a major North American professional sports league since the National Hockey League merged the Cleveland Barons into the Minnesota North Stars in 1978, and the first contraction by Major League Baseball since 1899. The Minnesota Twins began playing at the Metrodome in the 1982 season after playing for 21 seasons at Metropolitan Stadium. During their tenure at the Metrodome, the Twins won the World Series in 1987 and 1991. Nevertheless, the multipurpose stadium, which the Twins shared with the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League, had poor sightlines when the field was set for baseball, and the Twins received no revenue from signage, luxury suites, or parking. Additionally, the white, air-supported roof not only caused many fielders to have trouble tracking fly balls, but it also deflated due to heavy snow on numerous occasions. By the start of the 1990s, the Metrodome was already considered obsolete. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the Twins were often rumored to be moving to such places as Sacramento, California; Orlando, Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; and others in search of a more financially competitive market. In 1997, the team came close to an agreement to move to North Carolina, but the deal was not completed. There was also some speculation that Selig targeted the Twins because of his family's ownership of the Milwaukee Brewers, the next closest team to the Twin Cities, and which was set to potentially gain the Twins' market should the team be dissolved. Olympic Stadium was originally constructed as a multipurpose venue for the 1976 Summer Olympics, which Montreal hosted. The Montreal Expos began playing full-time at the stadium in the 1977 season, one year after the stadium's opening and the team's ninth year of play. Although the new stadium was an upgrade from Jarry Park Stadium, Olympic Stadium was still fraught with problems. A retractable roof that was scheduled to be finished when the Expos moved in was not finished until 1987, and began to leak within only a few years. In 1991, support beams collapsed and a 55-ton slab of concrete crashed onto a walkway outside the stadium, forcing the Expos to play their final 13 home games that year on the road. The stadium's poor conditions contributed to low attendance in Montreal. Throughout the 1990s, the Expos ranked near the bottom in the NL for attendance, including ranking last in each of their final seven seasons in Montreal. Owner Jeffrey Loria was unable to reach an agreement for television and English-speaking radio coverage to increase the team's broadcasting revenue, and his proposal for a new downtown ballpark was rebuffed by the Quebec government. On November 6, 2001, the day before the active MLB labor agreement expired, MLB franchise owners met in Chicago to vote on contraction, despite earlier reports that no such vote would take place. The owners voted 28–2 in favor of contraction. Although the Florida Marlins, Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Oakland Athletics had been discussed as candidates for elimination, the Expos and Twins were considered the likeliest teams to be folded. The owners of both teams were set to receive $250 million buyouts to let MLB take control of and fold their franchises. The plan also included division realignment so that each league would have an even number of teams. In the plan, the Texas Rangers would move to the American League Central, the Pittsburgh Pirates would move to the National League East, and the Arizona Diamondbacks would move to the American League West. Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) executive director Donald Fehr noted that the players' union had no say in the matter and called the decision ""imprudent and unfortunate...We had hoped that we were in a new era, one that would see a much better relationship between players and owners. Today's announcement is a severe blow to such hopes."" The MLBPA filed a grievance to block contraction the day after the vote. On November 16, the league's contraction plans were shelved when Hennepin County Judge Harry Crump ruled that the Minnesota Twins must honor their lease and play their final season at the Metrodome, citing the team's importance to the community. Had only the Expos been contracted, there would have been an odd number of teams in the two leagues, meaning one team would have to be idle every day. This would have made it all but impossible to preserve a 162-game schedule within the normal six-month season. By December 13, talks about contraction had ended, and on January 12, 2002, it was announced that no teams would be eliminated for the upcoming season. On January 16, Loria sold the Expos to Major League Baseball for $120 million. MLB formed Expos Baseball L.P., a partnership of the other 29 clubs, to operate the Expos. Loria then bought the Florida Marlins from John W. Henry for $158 million, using the proceeds from the Expos sale plus a $38.5 million no-interest loan from MLB. Henry then bought the Boston Red Sox from the Yawkey Trust. It was officially announced on February 5 that plans for contraction had been abandoned. On August 30, the owners and players approved a new collective bargaining agreement that forbade contraction until 2006. With no plans for a new ballpark in Montreal, Major League Baseball looked into relocating the Expos. Cities that expressed interest in the team included Washington, D.C.; Las Vegas, Nevada; Norfolk, Virginia; Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico; and Portland, Oregon. On September 29, 2004, Major League Baseball announced that the Expos would relocate to Washington, D.C. for the 2005 season. MLB owners voted 28–1 in favor of the move, with the Baltimore Orioles casting the lone dissenting vote. The team, re-branded as the Washington Nationals and being sold to Ted Lerner in 2006, played their first three seasons at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium before moving into the newly constructed Nationals Park in 2008. On May 26, 2006, after years of failed proposals, Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty signed a bill that approved funding for a new $522million ballpark, to which the Twins agreed to contribute $130million. The new stadium, named Target Field, opened in April 2010.",Normal

"Frank Gasparro (August 26, 1909 – September 29, 2001) was the tenth Chief Engraver of the United States Mint, holding this position from February 23, 1965, to January 16, 1981. Before that, he was Assistant Engraver. He designed both sides of the Susan B. Anthony dollar, both sides of the Eisenhower Dollar (with the exception of the Bicentennial issues of 1975–1976), the Lincoln Memorial reverse of the cent (minted from 1959 to 2008), and the reverse of the Kennedy half dollar. Gasparro was born in Philadelphia on August 26, 1909. His musician father wanted his son to continue in the family profession and would rip up drawings he made out of frustration. His father ultimately relented and had Gasparro apprentice under sculptor Giuseppe Donato, who had earlier worked for Auguste Rodin. Gasparro graduated from South Philadelphia High School in 1927 and has been inducted into the SPHS Alumni Cultural Hall of Fame. He attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and traveled to Europe with the aid of scholarships that allowed him to refine his craft. Friends close to Gasparro had serious suspicion regarding close ties he established to organized crime while in Italy but he routinely denied any connection. John Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI during Gasparro's tenure at the Mint, was often suspicious of Gasparro's intentions. Hoover was concerned Gasparro was being influenced by an Italian crime family in the town of Bari to design coins with details easily counterfeited by Italian Crime families. Gasparro was hired by the United States Mint in December 1942 under Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock. Gasparro's first major successful coin design was his redesign of the reverse of the Lincoln cent as part of the 150th anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, while he was Assistant Engraver at the Philadelphia Mint. Gasparro's design was selected from a group of 23 designs prepared by the Mint's engraving staff to replace the Wheat cent produced by the Mint from 1909 to 1958. His original design included the words ""Lincoln Memorial"" and 13 stars around the rim of the coin, which he removed at the request of staff at the Mint. Despite the complaints of his superiors, the design retained his initials to the right of the monument as well as the image of Lincoln seated in the monument, making it the first American coin to have the same likeness on both sides of the coin. Gasparro would often tell cashiers that he was a sculptor, and when asked where to find his work, he would reply, ""It's in your pocket."" By the time of his death, Gasparro's design had appeared on the more than 100 billion pennies produced by the Mint. Asked to produce a design for the Susan B. Anthony dollar, Gasparro found two photos of women's suffrage leader, one at age 28 and the other when she was 84. He initially chose the portrait of the younger Anthony, but widespread consensus was that the design made her look too pretty. His design using the older photo was accepted. While Gasparro felt that the Anthony dollar was his ""top achievement"", the coin was largely rejected by the public, which complained that the coin was too similar to the Washington Quarter. As the Mint's Chief Engraver from 1965 to 1981, Gasparro also created designs for the reverse of the Kennedy half dollar, for which he took painstaking attention to the details of the design of the seal of the president of the United States, making the words ""E pluribus unum"" more prominent. Other designs by Gasparro included medals for Winston Churchill, Albert Gallatin, Douglas MacArthur, and Sam Rayburn, along with the presidential medals for all Presidents from Lyndon B. Johnson to Ronald Reagan and numerous foreign coins produced by the Mint. One of his best known works was the obverse of the Congressional gold medal for John Wayne, widely bought by the public in bronze. Gasparro designed his coins by finding subjects, such as objects, animals, and people from various newspaper clippings, photographs, magazines, and books. Most of his sketches are based on one of two designs – Lady Liberty or eagles and each sketch was different from the last. He used a Xerox copier to copy photos, tracing paper to trace the shape, and transferred his designs to sketch paper. From there, he continued to make more sketches based on his subjects, and with each of them, added certain features, such as crowns, helmets, arrows, etc to the subject. Then a final sketch of the design would be created to serve as a reference to the mold. After his retirement from the mint he continued to design medals for both private and public groups. He also taught art at Philadelphia's Samuel S. Fleisher Art Memorial until shortly before his death. Gasparro died at age 92 on September 29, 2001, in Havertown, Pennsylvania. He was survived by his wife, Julia, and a daughter. A large population of individuals related to Gasparro through his brother Lawrence can be found in northeast Ohio.",Normal

Through February 2021, he is the 460th-most-streamed artist on Spotify, with over a billion cumulative streams. Heldens began his professional music career when he signed to Spinnin' Records in 2013. His first releases on the label included the songs ""Stinger"" and ""Thumper"", which features DJ Jacob van Hage. Heldens' 2013 song ""Gecko"" caught the attention of fellow Dutch DJ Tiësto, who signed the song to his label, Musical Freedom, and later released a vocal version through Warner Music Group's FFRR with British singer Becky Hill on 23 June 2014 as ""Gecko (Overdrive)"". The song peaked at number 1 on the UK Top 40 chart in June 2014, was named ""Essential New Tune"" by BBC's Pete Tong on 31 January 2014, and DJs including David Guetta, Martin Garrix, and Zedd began supporting it. In January 2014, Heldens launched his Heldeep Mixtape on his official SoundCloud page, creating extended mixes which incorporate various genres of electronic music including different types of deep house and tech-house. The first mixtape included his remix of fellow Spinnin' Records signee Martin Garrix's ""Animals"". In March 2014, Heldens also released a remix of Robin Thicke's ""Feel Good"".

"Divisions Maranatha Volunteers International (Maranatha) is a non-profit Christian organization founded in 1969 and is based in Roseville, California United States with offices in Canada, Latin America, India and Mozambique. It is a supporting ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church with the primary focus of organizing volunteers to build churches and schools in developing nations. In 1969 under the direction of John Freeman a commercial photographer, a group of Seventh-day Adventist volunteers flew to the Bahamas to build a church This idea expanded to other projects involving volunteers flying their private planes to locations to build churches and was organized into Maranatha Flights International based in Berrien Springs, Michigan. In 1989 Maranatha Flights International merged with Volunteers International under the new name of Maranatha Volunteers International and moved the headquarters to Sacramento, California. More recently, the headquarters were moved to the neighboring city of Roseville, California. In its 40-year history more than 60,000 volunteers have built churches, schools, orphanages, hospitals and community buildings in 67 countries. Maranatha has requests for 100,000 buildings pending. An average of 3,000 volunteers participate in projects each year. The majority of the volunteers are from the United States and Canada but participants come from all over the world. They generally pay for their transportation as well as a participation fee which covers meals, lodging, in-country transportation and insurance while on the project. Most projects are approximately two weeks duration. The funding for the buildings is primarily furnished by Maranatha via donors as well as participation by Adventist-laymen's Services & Industries (ASI). The local church provides the land and final labor and materials. Projects are classified into categories such as teen, young adult, open, group or family depending on the volunteer makeup. While the teen Ultimate Workout and young adult groups which are age limited, other projects have widely varying age volunteers. A number of volunteers participate in multiple trips, often on an annual basis. Not all volunteers are skilled in the construction trades. In addition to actual building construction, some volunteers are typically involved in cooking and some may participate in community projects such as Vacation Bible School or medical and dental clinics. Maranatha concentrates their building activities in certain countries which change from time to time. In 2010 Maranatha is building primarily in Cuba, Ecuador, Haiti, India, Malawi, Mexico, Mozambique, Zambia and the United States. In 2009, 507 churches were built of which 428 of the structures were ""One-Day Churches"" built in 25 countries. In 2010 Maranatha provided assistance to Haiti following the January 2010 earthquake. 140 ""One-Day Churches"" are currently being built in Haiti to be used as churches, schools, medical triage and temporary shelters. The One-Day Church was developed jointly by Adventist-laymen's Services & Industries and Maranatha in an effort to meet the demand for rapid economical construction of more buildings. The galvanized steel frame and roof of the church are manufactured at a facility in Dodge Center, Minnesota, containerized and shipped on-site where it is assembled by volunteers and local personnel in one day. The walls and floors are built of local materials and vary according to local practices. Floors are most often poured concrete. As of March 2009 over 1,000 structures had been manufactured and as of July 2010 more than 800 had been constructed in 10 countries. In June 2010 Maranatha introduced the One-Day School project at the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists session in Atlanta, Georgia. This project is an extension of the One-Day Church idea providing a metal frame, roof, walls, doors and windows. The project launch involves 1,000 classrooms with the first One-Day School to be built in Zimbabwe. The Ultimate Workout is a volunteer two-week mission program for high school age teenagers. These projects are generally in Latin America and may involve up to 200 volunteers. In July 2010 the Ultimate Workout project celebrated its 20-year anniversary with a reunion project in Chiapas, Mexico. Maranatha has a quarterly magazine named The Volunteer that is mailed to volunteers and donors. Since 2003 Maranatha has produced a 30-minute television program named Maranatha Mission Stories which documents various building projects. Now a weekly program, it has surpassed 100 episodes. It is shown on 3ABN and Hope Channel.",Normal
"The Akita Omoriyama Zoo (秋田市大森山動物園, Akitashi Omoriyama dōbutsuen), also known as “Milve”, is a municipal zoo opened in July 1967 in the city of Akita, Akita Prefecture, Japan. Opened in 1972, the zoo covers 15 hectares, with 114 species on display. It is accredited by the Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums (JAZA). The zoo is modeled after Asahiyama Zoo in Hokkaido with holding areas designed to mimic the animal’s natural habitat, and incorporating “action exhibits” where animal activity is encouraged, particularly during feeding time.

In September 1972, it was relocated to its present location. The zoo successfully bred the tanuki in captivity in 1974, followed by the barn owl in 1978, and Japanese marten in 1994. It also successfully artificially inseminated the black-backed jackal in 1990 and demoiselle crane in 1995. All of these successes were the first time for a zoo in Japan. In March 2015, the zoo recorded its 10 millionth visitor since its relocation to its present location.

"Rupin Pass is a high altitude pass across the Himalaya mountain range in state of Himachal pradesh India. It lies on a traditional shepherd and hiking route which starts from Dhaula in Uttarakhand and ends in Sangla in Himachal Pradesh. The path itself is located across mostly uninhabited areas in the Himalayan ranges at an elevation of 15,250ft (4,650M) above sea level. Sarasvati Glacier at Sarasvotri at this pass has been identified by some sources as the origin of paleo-river Sarasvati which turned in to icy waters at Netwar, flowing through Paonta Sahib and Adi Badri, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat. Rupin Pass trek consists of trails dug out of rock faces and wooden bridges, cut through deep dark folds in the mountain, glaciers and icy slopes, and over snow fields. Along the way there are white Rhododendrons and expanse of green meadows. There are different trails that access the Rupin Pass. One of them starts at the sleepy village of Gosangu which is the last road head of Himachal Pradesh. Generally, trekkers and adventurers travel to Gosangu by road from Shimla via Rohru. The alternate route to Rupin Pass starts from Naitwar, which is accessible from Dehradhun via Dhaula. From either of the two road heads, the first camp is Jhaka, the hanging village and the last stop for replenishing stocks and a look at the civilization. Traveling the Rupin Pass is a moderate – difficult level of climbing. The trails follow the Rupin river all the way to the top (Upper waterfall camp). Rupin pass is unique in a way that the ice melting on the one side of the pass forms the Rupin river that merges with Yamuna and eventually flows into the Bay of Bengal while the snow melting on the Sangla side of the pass merges into a stream the eventually flow into Sutlaj and hence flows into the Arabian sea. Rupin pass is at an altitude of 15250ft above MSL and to reach here follow the Dhaula 5,100ft to Gosangu 6,300ft.11km.

"In philosophy, proving too much is a logical fallacy which occurs when an argument reaches the desired conclusion in such a way as to make that conclusion only a special case or corollary consequence of a larger, obviously absurd conclusion. It is a fallacy because, if the reasoning were valid, it would hold for the absurd conclusion. The judgement of fallacy is therefore largely dependent on a normative judgement of the ""absurd"" conclusion. A charge of ""proving too much"" is thus generally invoked, rightly or wrongly, against normatively-opposed conclusions, and so such charges are often controversial at the time they are made, as in the following examples: Showing that an opponent has proved too much is a form of reductio ad absurdum.

"TSN.UA (stylised as TCH.ua) is a news website owned and operated by 1+1 Internet, LLC, subsidiary and division of 1+1 Media Group as the online arm of TSN. Along with original and wire reporting, it features content from 1+1 shows such as TSN Evening News, TSN Week, TSN in sign language, and The right to power, the 1+1 TV channel, and partners such as Spetskor and UNIAN. The site was established as news.1plus1.tv or news.1plus1.ua, later in 2008 already as tsn.ua. On June 18, 2018, it became known that TCH.ua was the first among Ukrainian journalists websites to launch AMP Stories. On October 15, 2018, TCH.ua was adapted for blind people. On March 16, 2020, it was announced that TCH.ua together with the 1+1 Digital development team updated the site's mobile application for the Android operating system. On March 23, 2022 at 2:00 p.m. on the main page of TCH.ua in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a link to the news section about the war from the editors of TSN in English, which is located on tsn.uaen and is updated to this day, appeared. In early 2016, TSN, together with the then contractor, relaunched the website with a new modern design. In addition to the redesign, part of the site code was refactored with additional features included. Already at the beginning, slow work, instability, inability to withstand the load was observed. The new site had problems of the work of an adaptive version on mobile devices, 1+1 Internet asked for help to Ideil. Ideil started work on conducting a technical audit. The results were disappointing. The quality of the code did not conform to any canons and practices. Spaghetti code is the main audit verdict. XSS-vulnerabilities, Blind SQL-injections, full of slow and complicated mysql slow log queries, slow file cache, problems with saving and processing videos and photos. February 17, 2016, marks the start of work stabilizing the website, fixing critical bugs and vulnerabilities. By dividing the monolithic architecture into microservices Ideil separated independent parts from the core, which served most media projects. Ideil have integrated Sentry for tracking all events and errors on the site. In May 2016, it was decided to abandon the old engine, as its development and maintenance were complex and expensive. Website development and the creation of new services turned into a struggle with the existing architecture and structure. Simultaneously supporting TSN, Ideil started working on a new website version using Laravel and vue.js, which was still ß at the time. Team consisting of 6 developers worked on the project during the first 3 months, spending about 400 hours monthly. They completely changed the database structure, the work process with stats and decided to keep the design, but change only layouts and the front-end. TSN editorial staff used CMS, which worked with an old, slow, and divided into several parts database. After designing a new database structure for the new site we had to additionally develop special software that would constantly synchronize data between two databases (old and new). It had to function this way until a new CMS was developed. While working on the website it wasn't planned to change the CMS, which operated through the old database structure, methods, and approaches to working with content. Migrator is a microservice responsible for transforming publications from the old format to the new one. It worked almost on the fly, tracking the new publications, the content change in existing ones, and posting this content in a new structure. During the testing phase, when the editors worked with the old admin panel, the content appeared both on the old and the new site, which was still under development at the time. Migrator worked in this mode for 8 months. January1,2017 at 2:00 a.m. the old website was disconnected and replaced by a new one, developed using Laravel and vue.js. Work on a new CMS began after the release. This system was implemented alongside the old one so the editors could work in both at the same time. Migrator has been configured for two-way content synchronization between the old and new CMS. It provided an easy transit to the new interface for editors and a gradual withdrawal of the old functionality. In autumn 2017 we relinquished the old code, disabled the migrator and the old CMS. The TSN website shared the news on mobile applications and Smart TV via API. The old API caused slow app operation, so Ideil refactored it completely: changed approaches and interactions. The old API was left for old applications and services legacy-support. Ideil have also updated applications for Android and Apple's tvOS, iOS and iPadOS platforms. In the summer of 2020, 1+1 Media updated the design of the TV news service. By the end of August, we needed to ""tune in"" the existing website version in accordance with the updated TV program style in order to prepare readers for a full-scale redesign. Ideil team redesigned everything according to the new guide, repblished the homepage: rearranged the grid and put the image form factors into an adequate shape, added more air, left the dark integrators behind and fixed the typography. They began working on the homepage layout and designing a new TSN website simultaneously. Ideil performed a complete site redesign and code refactoring. TSN received new formats, new content delivery, and a completely new codebase. Moreover, the programming language interpreter and frameworks, including vue.js and Laravel have been updated to the latest versions. During refactoring, Ideil aimed to reduce the loading speed of TSN pages from 2 seconds to several milliseconds. The editorial board planned to gain a foothold in the top rankings of Ukrainian online media. The next stage consisted of layout and frontend, one of the longest processes in the development of TSN. As a result, we got a whole new front. Nothing left from the previous version. And finally, programming. From the beginning of January 2021 until May of the same year, more than 500 committees were carried out. Refactoring involved at least 400 files with program code. All code is written in compliance with the PSR-12 standard. On June 7, 2021, a major redesign of TCH.ua was introduced; TCH.ua project manager Svitlana Panyushkina explained that the new design is a ""further improvement of our ""supermarket news"" concept"", by emphasizing multimedia content, original features, and more original reporting from TSN personalities. The team of news resource group 1+1 media TCH.ua updated the visual style of the site, technical characteristics and approach to working with content. The speed of the site has almost doubled, as a result of which it has become even more dynamic and more user friendly. New sections have appeared on the main page of the site: ""Trends"" — the most popular news according to readers, ""Spetstem"" — materials on current topics that define our lives today and in the future. In addition, special attention to the resource is paid to video content: it was brought to a separate top column, which is always located on the home page. In 2016, the headline to the news TCH.ua about the ex-official distorted its essence. The editors of the site apologized to readers and former deputy head of the Odessa Regional State Administration Oleksandr Borovik for an incorrect headline to the news about his sexual orientation. The headline has been changed and now the correct version of the news has been published on the site. At the same time, the editorial board is convinced that sexual orientation cannot be a reason for discrediting and oppressing a person and is everyone's personal choice. As of January 2012, TCH.ua had ranked first in Ukraine unique users among global news sites for 3 months in a row. April 2016 rankings show TCH.ua at number 1 among most popular news websites.

In 1981 the Welsh Race Drivers' Association (WRDA) was formed with the expressed intention of developing a new race circuit in Wales. At the same time the former RAF airfield at Pembrey, which had been used as a chicken farm, was acquired by Llanelli Borough Council. Following a representation by the WRDA the decision was taken to construct a racing circuit at the venue. The first race meeting was held on 21 May 1989, and the winner of the first race at the circuit was Nigel Petch in an MGB. In 1990 the BARC signed a 50-year lease to operate the circuit on behalf of Carmarthenshire County Council. The circuit is popular for testing, mainly due to its variety of fast sweeping corners and tight hairpins. It is often referred to as a drivers favourite. Formula One teams have tested at the circuit including McLaren and their drivers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost in the late 1980s. Arrows, Benetton, Jordan and Williams all tested at Pembrey in the early 1990s with BAR being the last Formula One team to test at Pembrey in 1998. The Seat and VX Racing BTCC teams have tested there in previous years, as has Nigel Mansell in a GP Masters car. These F1 cars are likely to have set times faster than the official lap record, and indeed locals at the circuit still talk of the sensational unofficial lap record set by Ayrton Senna. However, convention dictates that the official lap record is the fastest lap set under racing conditions, so that honour goes to Argentine Formula 3 driver, Brian Smith, who in a Dallara F397 set a time of 50.079seconds in 1997. Senna's lap time in testing was 44.43. In recent seasons the circuit has been a popular venue for GT and F3 teams to test at, not only because of the quality of the circuit, but also due to the less stringent noise restrictions in place than at other British circuits. The circuit has two different sections, an all tarmac race circuit and a rally cross circuit utilizing some of the race circuit with an addition off-road surface. The circuit is operated by the British Automobile Racing Club (BARC) under the terms of a 50-year lease from Carmarthenshire County Council. A third configuration was also used in 1996, which was that of a short oval. This followed the race circuit from the StartFinish straight, through the first two corners of the track, before turning left at the third corner and returning to the StartFinish straight. There were plans to include a quarter mile drag strip, but this never came to fruition.The proposed Drag Strip never got off the ground. The circuit has hosted the British Touring Car Championship twice, in 1992 and 1993 at which time the championship was the most popular motorsport series in the UK outside Formula One. Formula 3 races have also been run at Pembrey Circuit, and indeed many recent Formula 1 drivers including Jenson Button raced at Pembrey in their early F3 days. Pembrey twice hosted the European Rallycross Championship in 1997 and 1998. Top-level Superbike racing has also been hosted at Pembrey, in 1990 and 1994. Over the winter of 200506 a new pit lane was constructed. Highlights on the current calendar (2018) include rounds of the British Rallycross Championship and two rounds of the British Truck Racing Championship, organized by the BTRA. The circuit serves as the main venue for the Welsh Sports and Saloon Car Championship, which has been particularly successful in recent years attracting a wide range of cars and averaging grids of over 20. In addition, the British Motorcycle Racing Club, the British Drift Championship and two single venue rallies, amongst others, were held in February and October. Following an incident at the 1989 San Marino Grand Prix, the Alain ProstAyrton Senna war began to build up speed after the Frenchman said that McLaren had a pre-race agreement that whoever led into the first turn should stay there, which was ironically suggested by Senna. In Prost's view, Senna had broken this agreement by passing him partway round the first lap after the restart. The following week McLaren were testing at Pembrey, and Ron Dennis (team principal) summoned both drivers to attend, as he was determined to re-establish law and order. Senna was refusing to apologise, and Jo Ramírez even heard that “he’d apparently said that the deal had been not to actually pass Prost by slipstreaming before that the move was allowable!” He really only apologised because of the pressure under which Dennis put him at Pembrey, and for the good of the team but he wasn’t happy about it.

"Sir James John Gordon Bremer KCB KCH (26 September 1786 – 14 February 1850) was a British Royal Navy officer. He served in the Napoleonic Wars against France, the First Anglo-Burmese War in Burma, and the First Opium War in China. Born in Portsea, Portsmouth, Bremer joined the Royal Naval College as a student in 1797. He became a midshipman in 1802, serving in the North Sea, then qualified as a lieutenant in 1805. The first ship he commanded was HMSRattlesnake in 1807, stationed in the East Indies. He was promoted to post captain in 1814. After becoming commander of HMS Tamar, in 1824 he was sent to Melville Island, Australia, to establish a colony. Under his leadership, the north coast of Australia from 129° to 135° longitude was claimed as British territory. The colony was abandoned in 1828. He led British forces at the Battle of Berbera in 1827, a successful raid against tribes in the Horn of Africa. As a commodore, Bremer was the temporary commander-in-chief of British forces in the First Opium War, for two periods between 1839 and 1841. In 1841, he took possession of Hong Kong Island for the United Kingdom. From 1846 to 1848, he was joint commander (with Francis Augustus Collier) of the Channel Squadron and superintendent of Woolwich Dockyard. He retired in 1848, with the rank of rear admiral, and died in 1850. Bremer was born on 26 September 1786 in Portsea, Hampshire, England. He was the only son of Royal Navy Lieutenant James Bremer (who went missing in the East Indiaman Halswell off the coast of Dorset, England, on 6 January 1786) and his wife Ann, daughter of Captain James Norman. In 1794 at around 12 years old he joined the Royal Navy as a first-class volunteer on board HMS Sandwich, the flagship of Rear-Admiral Skeffington Lutwidge, at the Nore, from which he was discharged in June 1795. On 8 October 1797, he became a student of the Royal Naval College in Portsmouth, and re-embarked on 2 April 1802 as a midshipman on board HMS Endymion under Captain Philip Durham. Until July 1805, Bremer served in the flagship of Vice-Admiral James Gambier and Rear-Admiral Edward Thornbrough, HMS Isis, on the Newfoundland and North Sea stations. Shortly after passing his examination, he was appointed sub-lieutenant of the gun-brig HMS Rapid. On 3 August 1805, he became a lieutenant on board HMS Captain as part of William Cornwallis' force pursuing a French fleet at Brest. On 9 May 1806, Bremer was appointed to HMS Diana commanded by Captain Thomas James Maling in the Mediterranean Station, from where he proceeded to the Davis Strait. On 6 October, he served on board HMS Imogen, commanded by Captain Thomas Garth in the Mediterranean. On 28 May 1807, he was appointed to HMS Psyché commanded by Captain William Wooldridge in the East Indies, where he became commander of HMS Rattlesnake on 13 October. He became a post captain on 7 June 1814. On 4 June 1815, he was nominated a Companion of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath (CB). On 18 September 1823, just before his 37th birthday, Bremer was appointed commander of HMS Tamar. In February 1824, he was sent to Melville Island, Australia, to establish a colony. The site was intended as a military settlement to secure British trade in the region. It was hoped that a market would open to British merchants in the Malay Archipelago. In June 1824, Bremer arrived in Sydney where he spent a month collecting troops and stores. On 24 August 1824, he left Port Jackson, Sydney, on board Tamar, accompanied by Countess of Harcourt and Lady Nelson. The ships transported Royal Marines and 44 convicts guarded by the 3rd Regiment. After sailing through the Torres Strait, he arrived in Port Essington on 20 September. The north coast of Australia from 129° to 135° longitude was declared British territory. Bremer rejected Port Essington as a settlement due to its lack of fresh drinking water. On 26 September, the party landed at King Cove in Melville Island to build a settlement, which was named Fort Dundas on 21 October. However, the site was unhealthy, expensive to maintain, and did not develop into an advantageous commercial trading post. In November 1828, orders were given to abandon the post. In November 1824, Bremer sailed for India where he served in the First Anglo-Burmese War. On 25 January 1836, he was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order (KCH). In 1837, Port Essington was again selected as a possible trading station by Baron Glenelg. Bremer, who commanded the Alligator and Britomart, was again given charge of the expedition. He established a new post in October 1838, calling it Port Victoria. The port was active until 1843 and by 1849, Port Essington was abandoned after it had no commercial or military value. Under the encouragement of New South Wales Governor George Gipps, Bremer left Port Essington for China in June 1839, with the ships under his command, after news of trouble in the Chinese city of Canton. Rear-Admiral Frederick Maitland, commander of the East Indies and China Station, died in November 1839. As the senior naval officer, Bremer took over as commander-in-chief of British forces in the First Anglo-Chinese War as commodore. He was replaced by Rear-Admiral George Elliot in July 1840, but after Elliot's return home in November 1840, Bremer again assumed the post until the arrival of Sir William Parker in August 1841. Bremer commanded the capture of Chusan (5–6 July 1840), Second Battle of Chuenpi (7 January 1841), Battle of the Bogue (23–26 February), Battle of First Bar (27 February), Battle of Whampoa (2 March), and Battle of Canton (18 March). After Plenipotentiary Charles Elliot declared the cession of Hong Kong Island to the United Kingdom on 20 January 1841, Bremer reported on 26 January that he ""proceeded to Hong Kong, and took formal possession of the island in Her Majesty's name, and hoisted the colours on it, with the usual salutes and ceremonies."" This area became known as Possession Point, and this date is considered as the modern foundation of Hong Kong. On 1 February, he issued a joint proclamation with Elliot to the inhabitants, declaring the island British territory. On 24 August, he left China aboard the Atlanta with Elliot. For his services, Bremer received a vote of thanks from both houses of parliament, and on 29 July, he was made a Knight Commander of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath (KCB). On 30 April 1846, Bremer was appointed, jointly with Sir Francis Augustus Collier, to the command of the Channel Squadron, with his broad pennant on board HMS Queen. In November 1842, he became commodore-superintendent of the Woolwich Dockyard, where he commanded the yacht William and Mary. He retired from the dockyard on 13 November 1848. On 15 September 1849, Bremer was appointed to Rear-Admiral of the Blue. He served as a magistrate in Devonshire. He died of diabetes mellitus on 14 February 1850 at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England. On 27 March 1811, Bremer married Harriet, daughter of Royal Marines officer Thomas Wheeler and widow of Reverend George Glasse. They had two sons and four daughters: After Harriet's death in 1846, Bremer married Jemima Mary Harriet (1801–1879), the eldest daughter of Royal Navy officer James Brisbane, on 8 February 1848 at Tunbridge Wells.",Normal

"""Love in the First Degree"" is a song written by Jim Hurt and Tim DuBois, and recorded by American country music band Alabama. It was released in October 1981 as the third single from the band's album Feels So Right. It became the group's fifth straight No. 1 single (and second multi-week No. 1) on the Billboard magazine Hot Country Singles chart. ""Love in the First Degree"" became Alabama's biggest crossover hit, peaking at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1982. As with the previous single, ""Feels So Right,"" the song's pop ""love ballad"" style — along with the country rock style of its other songs — became the cornerstone of Alabama's sound throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Today, ""Love in the First Degree"" remains one of Alabama's most popular songs. The song, a mid-tempoed song with a strong country-pop beat, uses the analogy of being found guilty of a crime (this time, of love) and the perpetrator throwing himself on the mercy of the object of his affection.

"The Herald-Press is a daily newspaper published in Huntington County, Indiana. The newspaper was founded in 1848 as the Indiana Herald. In 1887 it was renamed to Huntington Herald, and in 1930 it merged with Huntington Press and became the Herald-Press. In the early 1960s, the paper was purchased by James C. Quayle, whose wife Corrine was the daughter of newspaper magnate Eugene C. Pulliam. Quayle had previously worked for Pulliam's Central Newspapers, Inc., which was the prior owner. In 1988, when George H. W. Bush announced his preference for Dan Quayle, Jim & Corrine's son, as candidate for Vice President of the United States, the celebration was at the Huntington, Indiana courthouse, less than a hundred feet from Dan & Marilyn Quayle's apartment above the Herald-Press office. Jim Quayle was a member of the John Birch Society and continued to follow the Central Newspapers policy of publishing a strongly partisan newspaper. That doesn't mean they buried stories unfavorable to Dan Quayle.

"Eschenz is a municipality in Frauenfeld District in the canton of Thurgau in Switzerland. The prehistoric shore village on Werd Island and in the Seeäckern area (northeast of Eschenz) are rich archeological sites that have contributed substantially to our understanding of the history of settlements in the narrow area around Lake Constance. The two sites remained settled throughout the prehistoric epoch and into the early historical era. In 1858, the settlement site was discovered on the main island. The excavation in 1882-83 by Schenk was followed by a second expedition in 1931-36 by Karl Keller Tarnuzzer. There was a smaller excavation in 1962 around the St. Otmars Chapel. The first settlement of the island was made shortly after BC 4000th (Early Pfyn culture) and was part of a migration into subalpine wetlands during the beginning of the late Neolithic era. A second settlement phase (late Pfyn culture) began after long break during the middle of the 4th millennium. This was followed by a third phase of settlement (Horgen culture, 2nd half of 4th millennium). After this phase, an increase in the lake level put the entire island under water during the first half of the 3rd millennium. The next settlement wasn't until the mid-Late Bronze Age (11th century BC). The lake waters rose again, interrupting the island settlements until the final phase of the Late Bronze Age (9th century BC). During this time, parts of a number of horse bridles were discovered, indicating that the island may have been a transportation hub due to its convenient location. A gold cup dating from the early bronze age, 2400–1600 BC, was found in Eschenz in 1916. The Roman era Vicus of Tasgetium which developed south of the Rhine Bridge, probably in the 2nd and 3rd Centuries, had its nucleus in Untereschenz. The settlement grew into the Kastell auf Burg in Stein am Rhein, which, together with fortifications in Pfyn and Arbon provided the Roman border defenses around Lake Constance. The modern village of Eschenz is first mentioned in 799 as castrum Exsientiae. In 87576 it was mentioned as Aschinza. In 958 Eschenz came to the monastery of Einsiedeln. From 1623 until 1798 the governor of the monastery of Einsiedeln held the low court at Castle Freudenfels in Eschenz. The parish of Eschenz was incorporated in 1362 under Einsiedeln. During the Reformation (1525–1529) the municipality converted to the new faith. In the course of the 1560s Counter-Reformation entered the village and converted the villagers back to the Roman Catholic faith. A Protestant minority population remained and they became part of the parish of Burg. The cemetery was used equally by both faiths until 1690. In 1851 the village of Hüttwilen separated from Eschenz to form an independent municipality. was located beyond the lake crest Munizipalgem. from Munizipalgem. E. separated. In 1835, a paper mill opened in Eschenz. Around the end of the 19th century, animal husbandry and agriculture replaced viticulture and fishing as the major industries. With the exception of Unipektin AG, which operates in the food industry, there is no industry in Eschenz. Eschenz has an area, as of 2009, of 12.01 square kilometers (4.64sqmi). Of this area, 6.3km2 (2.4sqmi) or 52.5% is used for agricultural purposes, while 4.38km2 (1.69sqmi) or 36.5% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 1.23km2 (0.47sqmi) or 10.2% is settled (buildings or roads) and 0.1km2 (25 acres) or 0.8% is unproductive land. Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 5.0% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 0.5% and transportation infrastructure made up 0.4%. while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 3.7%. Out of the forested land, 34.1% of the total land area is heavily forested and 2.4% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 49.4% is used for growing crops, while 3.1% is used for orchards or vine crops. The municipality is located in Frauenfeld District, near the outflow of the Untersee portion of Lake Constance into the Rhine river. Today it has grown toward Stein am Rhein's village section of Burg. It consists of the village of Eschenz and includes Freudenfels Castle (since 1812) and Insel Werd (Werd Island). Eschenz has a population (as of December 2020) of 1,868 As of 2008, 14.3% of the population are foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years (1997–2007) the population has changed at a rate of 6.9%. Most of the population (as of 2000) speaks German(93.7%), with Albanian being second most common ( 2.3%) and Serbo-Croatian being third ( 1.3%). As of 2008, the gender distribution of the population was 49.4% male and 50.6% female. The population was made up of 680 Swiss men (41.7% of the population), and 127 (7.8%) non-Swiss men. There were 719 Swiss women (44.1%), and 106 (6.5%) non-Swiss women.

"Brachysomophis longipinnis is an eel in the family Ophichthidae (wormsnake eels). It was described by John E. McCosker and John Ernest Randall in 2001. It is a marine, temperate water-dwelling eel which is known from a single specimen collected from Taiwan, in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. It is known to dwell at a depth of 50 metres, and is known to reach a total length of 42.1 centimetres. The species epithet ""longipinnis"" is derived from the Latin words ""longus"" and ""pinnus"", and means ""long fin"".

"Auchenbowie House is a laird's house (mansion) in Stirling, Scotland. The location is about 3.5 miles (5.6km) south of Stirling, on minor road west of the A872 west of the M80 at Auchenbowie. The land here was bought by Robert Bruce, Provost of Stirling (descendant of The Bruce) in 1555. The Laird's House was built during the 17th century, 1666 according to one source. According to The Times, it was ""built as an L-plan towerhouse ... extended in 1768 and again in the 19th century to create a capacious nine-bedroom, four-bathroom property"". The house was later expanded and remodelled in 1768, and again in the 19th century. It's located in the Stirling region of Auchenbowie. It passed through marriage to the Munro family in 1708 after a member of the Bruce family had to flee Scotland following the killing of a man in a duel. The Munro family were the owners in 1787 when Robert Burns, the Scots national makar (or poet) stayed and wrote in his journal about dining with the Munro of the day who was also a poet. Former British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, also stayed at the House when visiting a niece that had married into the Munro family. On September 5, 1973, it was designated a category A listed building. Little has been written about recent owners, but The Times indicated that Connie and Robert Donnelly had moved in 2012. A report about the House in 2019 stated that ""the original L-shaped plan remains essentially intact"" and added that it has been remodeled, then featuring nine bedrooms, stables and tennis courts. 56°03′52″N 3°55′52″W﻿ ﻿56.06444°N 3.93111°W﻿ 56.06444; -3.93111",Normal

"Jan Arne Björklund (born 18 April 1962) is a Swedish Liberal politician. He was member of the Riksdag from 2006 to 2019, representing Stockholm County, and served as leader of the Liberals from 2007 to 2019. Björklund served as Minister for Education from 2007 to 2014, and as Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden from 2010 to 2014. He was designated Swedish Ambassador to Italy on 28 May 2020 and took office on 1 September 2020. Björklund was born in Skene (today a part of Mark Municipality), Älvsborg County (today Västra Götaland County), Sweden. His father, Arne, worked in the textile industry; his mother, Ragna, came to Sweden from Norway as a war refugee in 1944. He came from a working class home, and both of his parents lacked higher education. After he had completed upper secondary education (gymnasium) in 1982, Björklund enlisted in the Swedish Armed Forces, and earned the rank of officer in 1985. He then served in the royal Svea Life Guards in Stockholm, from which he retired as a major in 1994 to start a new career in politics. In 1976, at the age of 14, Björklund became a member of the Liberal Youth of Sweden, the youth wing of the Liberal People's Party. He was elected a member of the board of the Liberal Youth in 1983, and served as its second deputy chairman between 1985 and 1987. He has served as a member of the board of the Liberal People's Party since 1990. He joined the party's leadership in 1995, became second deputy chairman in 1997, and first deputy chairman in 2001. In the 1991 Swedish general election, Björklund was elected as a substitute member of the Stockholm City Council, where he came to serve on the city's board of education. Between 1994 and 1998, he served as an oppositional vice mayor (Swedish: oppositionsborgarråd) in Stockholm. Between 1998 and 2002, he served as vice mayor for schools (Swedish: skolborgarråd), and between 2002 and 2006, he served again as oppositional vice mayor. In the run-up to both the 2002 and 2006 general elections, Björklund was chairman of the centre-right Alliance for Sweden's working group on education policy. In the 2006 election, Björklund was elected to the Riksdag; shortly thereafter, he was appointed Minister for Schools in the new centre-right cabinet led by Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt. Following Lars Leijonborg's decision to retire as party leader at the Liberal People's Party's national meeting in September 2007, Björklund was unanimously nominated by the party's election committee as the new party leader. He was elected new party leader on 7 September 2007. At the same time, he also took over Leijonborg's positions as head of the Ministry of Education and Research, and as Minister for Education. The change in his title as minister was merely formal, as his areas of responsibility were still those that he had as Minister for Schools. Following the 2010 Swedish general election, in which the Liberal People's Party became the second-largest party in the government coalition, Björklund replaced Maud Olofsson as Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden on 5 October 2010. Björklund is often seen as a representative of the more right-wing, hard-edged faction of the Liberal Party. He has focused most on school issues, where he is known for his support for orderliness and discipline. He has criticized the Swedish schools system for being too ""dopey"", and not focusing enough on knowledge. Among other things, he has advocated more frequent assessments and a reformed grade system. In 2002, during the run-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, as first deputy chairman of his party, Björklund expressed his support for Swedish participation in the multinational coalition on condition that the invasion received broad international support, which it did not. In January 2009, Björklund criticised the downsizing in recent years of the Swedish Armed Forces. During an interview on Swedish news program SVT, he stated: ""After the last years development in Russia, and the war in Georgia, Sweden must be able to mobilize more soldiers than we can today."" In 2019, Björklund got his wish to abolish the austerity tax (Värnskatten), a top tax rate of 5% points for incomes above €6,000 a month, in turn for supporting Stefan Löfven as prime minister. Björklund married Anette Brifalk in 1992, with whom he has two adopted children, Gustav and Jesper. He lives with his family in Bromma, Stockholm. He was a celebrity dancer in Let's Dance 2020 to be broadcast on TV4.",Normal
"Oregon Route 224 Oregon Route 224 is a state highway which runs through some of Portland's southeastern suburbs and ends in the Cascades. The northwestern terminus is an interchange with OR 99E in Milwaukie, a suburb of Portland. It continues east as the Milwaukie Expressway, but is formally part of the Clackamas Highway No. 171 (see Oregon highways and routes). After crossing Interstate 205 in Clackamas, it becomes the Sunrise Expressway for about two miles. Then, the highway continues east as a four-lane arterial, resuming its designation as the Clackamas Highway, and which it shares with OR 212. East of Clackamas, OR 224 splits off OR 212, and continues south as the Clackamas Highway, passing through hilly farmland. About eight miles (13km) north of Estacada, it overlaps OR 211. On the eastern edge of Estacada, OR 224 separates from OR 211, and heads southeast into the Mount Hood National Forest, here you are in the mountains heading to the small community of Ripplebrook, its southeastern terminus, where state highway maintenance ends. Drivers may continue along the paved United States Forest Service Road 46 to OR 22 in Detroit, though snow makes the road impassable approximately early November through early May. USFS Road 46 was formerly signed as a portion of OR 224, but was never a state-maintained highway. This is the second route in Oregon with the designation 224. There was an earlier version of OR 224 connecting US 99W (modern Oregon Route 99W) 3 miles (5km) south of Monmouth to Oregon Route 223 near Lewisville following today's Elkins Rd. In those days, Oregon Route 223 followed today's Airlie Rd and Maple Grove Rd between Falls City and Pedee). This incarnation of OR 224 existed from the inception of the Oregon Route System in 1932 until sometime between 1942 and 1944. The Clackamas Highway was realigned onto a section of I-205 in 1971. The easternmost 19 miles (31km) of OR 224 in Mount Hood National Forest was closed to traffic during the 2020 Labor Day wildfires, which damaged pavement, guardrails, and nearby trees. It is reopened to traffic on May 1, 2022, 19 months after its closure. The Sunrise Expressway (known as Sunrise Corridor during construction) is a limited-access highway in Clackamas. It serves as an extension of the Milwaukie Expressway portion of OR224. Planning for the expressway started in the 1980s. Plans weren't approved until 2010, with construction starting in 2013. Costing $130 million, the expressway opened on July 1, 2016. A multi-use path for use by bicyclists and pedestrians was constructed along the highway. It is the newest highway constructed in the Portland metropolitan area since OR213 bypassed Oregon City in 1989. Milepoints are as reported by ODOT and do not necessarily reflect current mileage. Z indicates overlapping mileage due to construction longer than established route, and – indicates negative mileage behind established beginning point. Segments that are locally maintained may be omitted. For routes traversing multiple named state highways, each milepoint is preceded by the corresponding state highway number.The entire route is in Clackamas County.",Normal

"Servas International (""we serve (peace)"" in Esperanto) is a non-profit organization proving a hospitality exchange service. Servas is a nonprofit member organization that builds peace and cross-cultural understanding through day visits or overnight home stays among members who share information about themselves, to help ensure accountability. It was founded in 1949, in the aftermath of World War II, by Bob Luitweiler and other Danish students as an international network for people to meet and where suitable, to be offered a short stay, as part of the peace movement. The organisation may now be described as a platform, part of a gift economy. Members can be both hosts and travellers, and hosts do not charge for lodging. Members pay an annual fee to the organization, which is determined locally by country. There is an international executive and each country has an elected board or committee to manage membership (including interviews for new applicants), determine membership fees, organise social events, support various peace-related activities. . Servas is owned by an accredited Non-governmental organization and has been affiliated with the United Nations since 1973. Outside of Stockholm, on the way back from Helsinki, I visited a work camp for peace where Gertraud Hertling, a German student volunteer sowed the first seed of Servas. A shapely girl with a ready smile, she said in excellent English, ""You cannot imagine how isolated the. German youth are. First, as a result of the Nazi regime then during the 'War, our youth have been cut off. Now the occupation forces allow us to take no more than five dollars out of the country. You can't go far with that. How can our German youth, locked into occupied Germany, learn the meaning of democratic ways?"" One of the advantages of traveling alone is the frequent loneliness of being far from home in a strange land. Missing friendly human contact impelled me to talk with everyone I chanced to meet - someone sitting nearby waiting for the train or ferry, someone siting alone in a restaurant; someone sitting in the park or walking near me. Evety kind of person enlarged my knowledge and gave me new insights. The next Servas seed came from a young American whom I met that on the road. He told me at great length and in the strongest reactionaty terms how terrible the Swedish Socialist government was. At that time there was almost no countty in Europe that cared more for its working people without blocking entrepreneurial' initiatives. as the Communist countries did. Sweden's medical services were excellent and mostly free. Their Consumer's Co-operative movement was the envy of thoughtful people around the world. Their educational system was also outstanding. Of Equal significance, there were no unemployed or poor people. I was profoundly disturbed up by his attitude. This young man had gotten the most biased picture of Sweden possible from the reactionaty rich host family he had been placed with for the summer, by a well known international student exchange program. Ouch! There was certainly a need for a different hospitality system. When it is started in 1949 hosts are printed by country and posted by each country to other member countries. Each member country has different organization and organ. Servas International formed as federation. It is named as Peace Builder in the beginning later renamed as Servas International. Incorporation of Servas International General Assembly In 1972 the importance, of establishing a legal international entity was discussed. It was agreed that it was necessary to have a legal framework for financial, administrative international requirements. Dr. Max Habicht, Jnternational Lawyer and International Servas Sponsor prepared the attached ""Statutes of Servas International"" (Corporation Charter). The Charter was adopted and signed by all National Secretaries in attendance at the Conference.

"In this List of Perkins engines, family type refers to the two letter designation Perkins Engines gives each engine. This nomenclature was introduced in 1978 under Perkins' new engine numbering scheme, where the family type is encoded in each unique serial number. Engines that went out of production prior to 1978 may have been retroactively assigned a family type to expedite parts support (this is the case with the Perkins 4.107). Some engines never entered production, such as the Perkins 4.224, but were assigned a family type. In the early years, Perkins gave names to their engines, beginning with the smallest Wolf. The larger Lynx and Leopard followed (all four-cylinders), with the 1937 P6 was intended to be called the ""Panther."" After a lawsuit from motorcycle manufacturer Phelon & Moore, Perkins dropped the Panther (and Python and Puma for the corresponding P3 and P4 models) and stuck to abbreviations from then on. Perkins was sold by Massey Ferguson's parent Varity Corporation in 1998, and is now a fully owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc. 3 Cyl Tier 3 EPA rated Engine replaced the 103.10 in the Caterpillar Arr# 145-6693 like in mini ex 301.8. The 4 107T was used in UK Military electricity generating sets, the engines when in need an overhaul were rebuilt by a Kent based engineering works in Ramsgate, adjacent to the inner Harbour known as Walkers Marine (Marine Engineers) Ltd. Houchins of Ashford an MOD contractor would send an MOD inspector to verify dynamometer testing of power and smoke emissions both on start up and full power for one full hour (27 horsepower produced at 3000 rpm) being used near military front lines any excessive smoke whilst running would give the armies position away. When the transport vessel ""Atlantic conveyor"" was sunk during the Falklands conflict a large quantity of these generating units were lost. The engines were highly stressed due to turbo charging, the 4-107T used a Holset Brand turbocharger without after-cooling, and the longer 4-108 pistons with extended skirts, also a toughened tufftrided crankshaft, larger diameter cylinder head studs were used to contain the high combustion pressures.

"Union of Myanmar (until 1989) Non-state opponents The New Democratic Army – Kachin (Burmese: ကချင်ဒီမိုကရေစီသစ် တပ်မတော်; abbreviated NDA-K) was an armed insurgent group that operated from 1989 until its conversion into a ""border guard force"" in November 2009. The NDA-K was founded in 1989 by former Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) officers Zahkung Ting Ying (a.k.a. S'Khon Tein Yein), Layawk Zelum, and Ying Zelum, when they led a communist faction of 700 soldiers that split from the KIO due to its political differences. In the same year, the group agreed to a ceasefire with the government, and it de facto operated under the Tatmadaw's command as a ""special regional task force"". The group received a budget, rations, and supplies from the government. Additionally, 600 soldiers were paid by the government as part of the Myanmar Police Force. In November 2009, the group became one of the first insurgent groups under a ceasefire agreement to convert into a ""border guard force"". Some members have since joined the Kachin State Progressive Party (KSPP) to contest in the 2010 general election. A Rawang leader Lauban Tanggu Dang (Ah Dang; Burmese: တန်ဂူးတန်) established the Rebellion Resistance Force from the NDA-K group. Zahkung Ting Ying is a Ngochang from the Yunnan Frontier. In 1968, he split from Kachin Independence Army and joined the Communist Party if Burma and established the CPB's 101 War Zone with Zaluman, another KIA defector. In 2016, he was expelled from the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw for violating election laws while campaigning. Illegal rare earth mining has surged in NDA-K held areas bordering China following the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état. In April 2021, 100 rare earth mines were found in the area controlled by the militia. As the Chinese government cracked down on domestic rare earth mining, it has outsourced the destructive mining to Kachin State. As of March2022, 2,700 mining collection pools scattered across 300 separate locations were found in Kachin State, encompassing the area of Singapore, and an exponential increase from 2016.

"Robert Herbert Carcasson (5 December 1918, in Cheltenham, UK – 23 September 1982, in Victoria, B.C., Canada) was an English entomologist who specialised in butterflies, but also authored two field guides to tropical fishes. He joined the Coryndon Museum, Nairobi, as senior entomologist in 1956. He then became its director, under the museum's new name of the Natural History Museum from 1961 to 1968. During this time, he was awarded a PhD for his studies on African hawkmoths. From 1969 to 1971 he was Chief Curator of the Centennial Museum, Vancouver, Canada. In 1972 he travelled in Polynesia, Melanesia, Australia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Seychelles and East Africa for production of two field guides to coral reef fish of the Indo-Pacific region. From 1973 to 1979 he was Curator of Entomology at the Museum of British Columbia. He died of cancer. Somewhat a polymath, he was fluent in a number of languages, and produced the illustrations to a number of his works, culminating in hundreds of colour and line drawings of fishes for his reef fish field guides.

He became interested in the acclimatisation of plants, and transformed the garden into a commercial plant nursery, named ""Jardin Filhe"" in honour of its former proprietor. He published, among other things, ""Jardin d'acclimatation, Catalogue des végétaux exotiques"". Solanum rantonnei was named in his honour and later synonymised with Lycianthes rantonnetii.

Hyères became an important centre for the acclimatisation of palms and many residents created their own gardens of exotic plants: Jacques Nicolas Ernest Germain de Saint-Pierre (château Saint-Pierre des Horts), Alphonse Denis (château Denis), Gustave Bonnet (villa Marguerite) and Gustave Charles Ferdinand de Bonstetten (villa Mathilde).",Normal
"The Everyman Gerrards Cross is a cinema located in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire. Originally known as The Playhouse, it has continually served Gerrards Cross as a cinema since it first opened in 1925 and is the oldest cinema in Buckinghamshire. It has been owned by several cinema chains and is currently operated by Everyman Cinemas. The Playhouse was built in 1925 to the design of J. Stanley Beard, an illustrious cinema architect and resident of Gerrards Cross. It was located on Berwick Road (now Ethorpe Crescent). Originally, very lavish and elaborate designs were planned in 1923. However, these plans were superseded by more modest ones in 1925. According to a local guide at the time, the Playhouse was modelled ""along the lines of that adjoining Buckingham Palace"". Perhaps this regal inspiration was most encapsulated by the large Doric pillars that ran along one side of the auditorium. Seating was provided for 452, all stalls, with four boxes to the rear. There was a unique standing lobby that ran parallel to the auditorium. This allowed up to 150 people a place to wait to be seated. The screen was 16 x 12 feet (5 x 3.5m) and the proscenium was 25 feet (7.5m) wide with a stage underneath it. There were footlights across the stage which cast light onto the curtains which were mauve and old gold. There were also dressing rooms to the right of the stage, as the cinema would occasionally host live performances. One of these was the Gerrards Cross Operatic Society who used to perform regularly before the Second World War. The cinema was opened in the days before the widespread exhibition of talking pictures, so it was built with an orchestra pit at the front of the auditorium and each performance was accompanied by musicians. The entrance foyer was fairly small and octagonal. It had a high ceiling and a terrazzo floor. The box office was located to the right, and the standing lounge on the left. There was also a direct entrance to an adjacent building where there was a cafe on the ground floor and a dancehall upstairs. To the rear of the building there was a car park for up to 30 cars. Externally the building had an octagonal entrance tower that was constructed with 3 Georgian style entrance doors which were adorned with neon lights. The tower was engraved with the words ""Picture Play House"" in the masonry. The word ""Playhouse"" was also displayed in large neon letters. The first owner of the cinema was the ubiquitous Charles F Cheshir (1877-1954). He had previously been the proprietor of the first cinema in Beaconsfield, the Picture House, which remained until 1927. He was also the proprietor of the Royalty cinema in Bourne End and even unsuccessfully proposed to build another cinema in Chalfont St Peter in 1937. The General Manager of the Playhouse was his son Charles ""Eric"" Cheshir (1902-1991). The Cheshirs ensured films changed 3 times a week, with a regular Saturday morning children's club. On its opening night, Monday 12 October 1925, the Playhouse exhibited ""I'll Show You the Town"", a silent film starring Reginald Denny and Marian Nixon. The programme was opened with Madama Ada Davis singing the British national anthem, God Save the King and also included Pathé newsreels and Pictorials. The price of admission in 1931 was:  The Playhouse was sold to Southan Morris (S.M. Super Cinemas, Ltd.) in 1947. Three years later, in 1950, the new owners undertook several interior alterations to the cinema. These included removing the boxes, re-raking the stalls floor and installing new seats. The Playhouse is set a few yards back from the high street, so a new continuous posterboard was erected to draw attention to the cinema from the main road. In 1954 S.M. Super Cinemas, Ltd. was acquired by Essoldo Cinemas. The Playhouse was acquired by Essoldo as part of the buyout. However, the cinema remained as the Essoldo Playhouse until 1969. At some point during this period the neighbouring dancehall and cafe were sold off, as today they are flats, a takeaway pizza restaurant and a salon. In 1969 the cinema was closed and heavily refurbished. The facade was drastically altered into a more modern style. The original entrance doors and arches were removed. Two sets of the doors were replaced with more conventional glass ones and a large floor to ceiling window was installed. The external brickwork was tiled over. A new readograph was installed above the entrance displaying what films were showing. The original proscenium was removed along with the orchestra pit. The auditorium was painted black and 392 new seats were installed with red carpets and drapes to complement the decor. The kiosk was relocated to the left of the foyer and the standing lounge was turned into store rooms. The building was also given central heating for the first time. Seven light boxes were also installed along the side of the building displaying the new Essoldo name, with dark blue letters on an orange background. The Playhouse name was dropped and it became known as the Essoldo Gerrards Cross. The new Essoldo reopened on Saturday 29 November 1969, with a charity performance of the Battle of Britain, starring Laurence Olivier. The guest of honour to the event was Air Chief Marshal Sir Gareth Clayton of the RAF. In 1972 the Essoldo chain was bought by the Classic Cinemas Ltd. chain, and the cinema changed hands again. Externally the changes were minimal, with just a simple renaming. The Classic reopened on 26 March 1972 showing Paint Your Wagon, starring Lee Marvin, Clint Eastwood and Jean Seberg. However, perhaps the most prodigious alteration to the cinema came in 1979. After plans to build a large 304 seat auditorium in the car park in 1973 and a more modest 140 seat mini auditorium in 1978 were denied on environmental and car parking grounds, the cinema needed to keep up and compete with the rise in popularity of multiplex cinemas. In 1979 plans were granted to allow a second auditorium to be added in the roof of the building. Construction works were undertaken and the second theatre was added above the rear of the original auditorium, facing the opposite direction. The interior layout was vastly altered to incorporate the new design, including the complete removal of the original projection box. This was relocated in a fairly unusual setup in the centre of the building. One projector, serving Screen One, the original auditorium, is a short throw from the screen. Directly above it, the projector for new Screen Two faces the opposite way. The new seating capacities were 386 (Screen One) and 213 (Screen Two). In late 1985 Classic Cinemas was sold to Cannon and the cinema became a Cannon cinema. In the 1992 Cannon was bought by MGM and once again the cinema was renamed. In 1995 the cinema was taken over by ABC Cinemas. The cinema exterior was altered slightly, with a new red canopy. The large floor to ceiling window was removed. A new box office was added in the recess where the window once stood. The colour scheme in the screens was golden. The life of the ABC was fairly short lived as in 2000 ABC was merged with ODEON Cinemas by its owner Cinven. When the ABC Gerrards Cross was rebranded as ODEON a £250,000 refurbishment was undertaken. Firstly, the cinema was given disabled access for the first time in Screen One. Secondly, a new larger food concessions area was created by taking out a few rows from the back of Screen One. The exterior was also renovated. The tiles originally added in the 1960s were covered with navy blue tiles and large neon ODEON letters were added. In 2009 ODEON Gerrards Cross had its first digital projector installed, with 3D capability. In 2011 it was made fully digital, with the ability to air live shows from venues such as the Royal Opera House, the National Theatre and the Metropolitan Opera House. In April 2015 it was announced that Everyman Cinemas were in negotiations to purchase ODEON Gerrards Cross along with 3 other ODEON Cinemas. The ODEON was closed on 6 August 2015. The new owners immediately began extensive refurbishment works. After 11 weeks of refurbishment, the Everyman Gerrards Cross reopened on 23 October 2015, just over 90 years after it first opened. On its opening night the cinema exhibited Macbeth, starring Michael Fassbender, and The Martian, starring Matt Damon. The building had been changed substantially to fit into the new Everyman style. Externally the canopy that was added in 1969 was removed and a new readograph was installed which emphasises the octagonal shape of the tower. A new neon Everyman sign was installed, reminiscent of the original Playhouse sign from years ago. The cinema featured an unconventional exterior decor of black and white photographs of paparazzi, however, this has now been changed to more conventional dark green tiles. The external refurbishment has made the façade look very similar to how it looked when the cinema was the Playhouse between 1925 - 1969. The planning applications show that Everyman intended to restore some of the buildings original external features, including the original entrance doors, however ""the round-headed doorways are no longer in situ and, as such, it is not possible to restore these original features as Everyman had hoped."" The planning statement also demonstrated that Everyman planned to undertake the ""removal of the blue tiling to reveal the brick frontage"" which would have been ""made good and repointed."" However, once the work was undertaken, Everyman discovered that ""unfortunately, since planning permission was granted, it has become apparent that the existing brickwork behind the blue tiles is not in a sufficient state to be usable for a new shopfront"". Internally the building was also altered dramatically. The wall at the back of Screen One was moved into the auditorium approximately 10 feet (3m), meaning a reduced capacity but a larger foyer. Several walls in the foyer were also removed to increase the overall size. The new foyer has many new seating areas, something its previous incarnations lacked. The new theme is comparable to that of a relaxed bar, and fits into the boutique category that Everyman markets its cinemas as. The theatre style seats in the auditoria were removed and replaced with sofas and armchairs, a common theme within the Everyman chain. The new capacity of 115 and 87 seats greatly differed from its previous capacity of 296 and 182. In January 2019 plans were approved to create a third screen in the car park of the cinema. After a few months of construction and a brief closure, the Everyman Gerrards Cross reopened in June 2019 with 3 screens, almost exactly 40 years after it was twinned in 1979. The new auditorium, which sits neatly in a space between two existing extensions on the side of the building, is approximately 55 feet (16.5m) by 26 feet (8m) and houses enough space for a small 43 seat screen. The bar area was moved approximately 90 degrees to accommodate the new entrance to Screen 3 and a new, bigger kitchen was also constructed in the extension. The screen boasts a new Sony 4K projector, which has a higher resolution than the older 2K NEC projectors which serve Screens 1 and 2. It is also not located in the original projection room. The Everyman Gerrards Cross is just 3½ miles (5.6km) away from Pinewood Studios and it was selected to feature in a few films over the years. In the opening scene of Carry on Camping in 1969, the exterior of the building is shown in its original splendour. The scene where they are watching Nudist Paradise was also filmed at the Playhouse. The cinema also featured in the 1968 film Prudence and the Pill in a scene where Grace and Henry Hardcastle decide to go to pictures but change their mind just outside The Playhouse cinema. The neon ""Playhouse"" is clearly pictured in the scene.",Normal
"Hugues Fabrice Zango (born 25 June 1993) is a Burkinabé athlete who specialises in the triple jump and the long jump. He is the world indoor record holder in the triple jump with a jump of 18.07m (59ft 3+1⁄4in) set in 2021 and the reigning world champion, winning the gold medal in the triple jump at the 2023 World Championships. Zango competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and won the bronze medal at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, in the triple jump event, the first ever Olympic medal for Burkina Faso. He has also competed in World Championships, two African athletics championships, a Jeux de la Francophonie, two Summer Universiades and two African Games. He became the first-ever Olympic medalist for Burkina Faso earning a bronze medal and set the African triple jump record at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha. Zango's debut at an international athletics competition was at the 2013 Summer Universiade, where he competed in the triple jump. In the qualification round his best jump was 15.74 metres, a distance that qualified him for the final. Zango finished sixth with a jump of 15.96 metres in the final. His jump was 1.05 metres smaller than the jump of gold medalist, Ukrainian Viktor Kuznyetsov, and 61 centimetres smaller than the bronze medalist, Kazakhstani Yevgeniy Ektov. Also in 2013 was the 2013 Jeux de la Francophonie. At the 2013 Jeux de la Francophonie, Zango competed in the triple jump. He jumped 15.97 metres to finish tenth in a twelve-athlete field. Zango's next major competition was the 2015 Summer Universiade, where he competed in both the long jump and the triple jump. In the long jump, Zango's best jump was 6.73 metres, a distance that placed him 30th in qualification, out of 36 athletes. He did not qualify for the final. In the triple jump, Zango qualified for the final after jumping a distance of 16.59 metres in the qualification round. In the final, Zango jumped 16.76 metres, a distance that won him the silver medal. Zango's jump was 53 centimetres smaller than the gold-medalist's (Russian Dmitriy Sorokin's) jump of 17.29 metres. Zango jumped the same distance as bronze medalist Xu Xiaolong (China) but, as Zango's second best jump was further than Xiaolong's, Zango won the silver medal on count back. Zango was Burkina Faso's only medalist at the 2015 Summer Universiade. Zango competed at the 2015 World Championships in the triple jump. In the competition, all three of his jumps were fouls and therefore he recorded no mark (NM). Zango then competed in the 2015 African Games. Zango finished fifth in the triple jump with a jump of 16.36 metres. Zango was 19 centimetres behind the bronze medalist, Mamadou Chérif Dia of Mali. At the 2016 African Athletics Championships, Zango won the silver medal in the triple jump. He jumped 16.81 metres, which was 32 centimetres less than the distance jumped by the gold medalist, Nigerian Tosin Oke. Zango jumped four centimetres further than the bronze medalist, Godfrey Khotso Mokoena of South Africa, and 20 centimetres further than the fourth-placed athlete, Mauritian Jonathan Drack. At the 2016 Summer Olympics, Zango competed in the triple jump. Zango jumped 15.99 metres in the qualification round. His jump was the 34th best out of 47 athletes. Zango's jump was 62 centimetres less than the shortest jump by an athlete that qualified for the final, Cuban Lázaro Martínez. Therefore, Zango was eliminated from the competition. Before the 2019 World Championships in Doha, Burkina Faso's best Athletics World Championship result was 10th place for Franck Zio in the long jump at the 1995 World Championships in Gothenburg. Qualifying for the final in Doha, Zango performed consistently well with 17.46 m in round 2 and 17.56 m in round 5, before setting a new African Record with a distance of 17.66 m in the sixth and final round. With this record, Zango claimed the bronze medal - his (and Burkina Faso's) first at a major championship. In the 2020 Summer Olympics, held in 2021, Zango won the bronze medal (and so far the only one for his country in the Olympics) in the men's triple jump with a distance of 17.47 meters. He qualified for the final with a distance of 16.83 meters in the earlier heats. Going into the event, he was ranked fourth in the world and had a personal and season best of 18.07 meters. This was Burkina Faso's first Olympic medal, and Zango earned it on 5 Aug, Burkina's Independence Day. On 16 Jan 2021, in his final attempt jumping at a jumps-only indoor meet in Aubière, France, Zango jumped 18.07m (59ft 3+1⁄4in) to improve his coach, Teddy Tamgho's Indoor World Record by 15cm. He became the first world record holder from Burkina Faso and the first African to hold a world record in a jumping event. The jump ranks him the 6th performer in history, indoors or outdoors. Zango graduated with a Master's degree in Electronics, Electrical energy, and Automation from the University of Artois (Hauts-de-France, France) in 2018. Subsequently, he is working on a PhD degree in electrical engineering at the same university. He expects to complete the degree in 2022. He completed his degree on 22 December 2023.",Normal
"The Mongol in Our Midst: A Study of Man and His Three Faces is the title of the pseudo-scientific book written by British physician Francis Graham Crookshank and published in 1924. The book, characteristic of the consequently discredited ideas of scientific racism prevalent at the time, explored and presented the idea that ""Mongolian imbecility"" (a form of intellectual disability now called Down's syndrome and known to be caused by the replication (trisomy) of the chromosome 21) was an atavistic throwback to, andor the result of, rape committed by members of the supposedly more primitive ""Mongoloid races"" (such as the Huns, Avars or the Mongols themselves) in the wake of their various invasions of Europe throughout history. The book also claimed that ""Mongolian imbecility"" was partly the result of Ashkenazi Jews having interbred with the steppe tribe of the Khazars. In The Mongol in Our Midst, Crookshank argued that ""Mongolian imbecility"", thought at the time to affect only Caucasian people, was the result of the distant racial history of a person with the disorder. Crookshank argued that both parents of a person with ""Mongolian imbecility"" either carried genetic traits inherited from a commonly shared ""Mongoloid"" ancestor, or that all Caucasians shared a distant ""Mongoloid"" ancestry. As a result, ""Mongolian imbecility"" constituted an atavistic genetic throwback, wherein the supposed ancestral genetic traits of the individual reappeared, having been ""lost"" throughout generations of ancestors and evolutionary change. Crookshank believed the re-emergence of these genetic traits was due to the individual in question's incomplete development in the womb. Crookshank deemed ""Mongolian imbeciles"" to be a ""race apart"" from Caucasian people, describing that ""For better or for worse, they are not quite as are other men and women around them"", and describing English patients with the condition as ""Mongol expatriates"". In support of his theory, Crookshank relied on a set of physical traits and behaviors he dubbed the ""Mongolian stigmata"", among which he included small earlobes, protruding anuses, and small genitals in both sexes, all of which he claimed to be common among both ""Mongolian imbeciles"" and members of what he termed the ""Mongoloid race"", which included Chinese and Japanese people, as well as those from Mongolia. Crookshank also cited the cross legged sitting posture of both some ""Mongolian imbeciles"" and some depictions of the Buddha in statues as further supporting evidence for his theory. Despite Crookshank's widely popular depiction of those with the condition, his description of Down's Syndrome as linked with the Mongolian people was not the first in medical literature, with Scottish scientist Robert Chambers credited with the first recorded link between the race and the condition in his 1844 work Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. John Langdon Down, whose name is used for the condition today, coined the term ""imbecile of the Mongoloid type"" in 1856, labelling those with the condition the ""Mongolian type of Idiot"" as part of Down's wider theory that it was possible to classify different types of conditions by supposed ethnic characteristics. Despite his comparison, Down stressed the fact that the parents of the patients he described were of Caucasian heritage, and that his patients, therefore, were not ""real Mongols"". However, in reference to this, Crookshank argued at length that Down's patients, for their perceived similarities to Mongolian people, were, therefore, ""real Mongols"" as Down had argued against. Where Down presented his observation that white parents could have offspring who bore a superficial resemblance to other races as evidence of ""the unity of the human species"", Crookshank argued the reverse, allying himself with the views of his German translator, Eugen Kurtz, to claim that the different human races were, in fact, different species, themselves descended from different species of apes. The Mongol in Our Midst successfully reached a broad audience and experienced considerable popularity. A contemporary review of the book's third edition in the Journal of the American Medical Association states that the first edition ""attracted wide attention when it first became available"", with an entry in The British Journal of Psychiatry in 1931 remarking that The Mongol in Our Midst ""excited considerable excitement on its first appearance"". However, the book also received some critical approbation at the time; one contemporary review in the journal Nature praised Crookshank as ""argu with much skill in favour of his view"" on atavism, but was more dubious of his promotion of polygenism, noting that it had ""not found favour among anthropologists generally"" and that ""this part of his theory has been most strongly criticised"". One contemporary reviewer remarked whether ""this theory was ever seriously entertained by anyone other than the author himself"", with other contemporaries of Crookshank viewing his arguments as ""preposterous"" and ""flimsy in the extreme."" A review of the first edition in The Nation wondered briefly whether the whole book was simply a hoax, as ""The author's thesis need only be stated to be refuted with a laugh"". The book experienced popularity in the 1920s and 1930s; despite some criticism from medical contemporaries of Crookshank, the book was expanded from its 123 page first edition in 1924 to over 500 pages by its third edition in 1931, with Crookshank publishing his fully rewritten and much expanded subsequent editions in open response and rebuttal to his critics, with the third edition including responses by Crookshank to critics, as well as expanding the book's anthropological and clinical material, including its various speculations and arguments. Modern medical scholars regard Crookshank's work as one devoid of true scientific substance, and instead as a product of racial thought of the time, constituting ""a grand edifice of absurd allegations about the orangutan, the racial 'Mongolian,' the ""Mongoloid,' all of whom were said to share a variety of homologies."" Crookshank's theories were refuted entirely by the discoveries in 1959 of trisomy 21, the genetic defect causing Down's Syndrome, although the term ""Mongolism"", despite Crookshank's contributions to its stigmatization, took several decades to fade away entirely.",Normal
"HMS Sirius was an Apollo-class cruiser of the British Royal Navy which served from 1892 to 1918 in various colonial posts such as the South and West African coastlines and off the British Isles as a hastily converted minelayer during the First World War. The Naval Defence Act 1889 resulted in orders being placed for 21 second-class protected cruisers of the Apollo-class, of which, two, HMS Sirius and HMSSpartan, were ordered from Armstrong's Elswick shipyard. Sirius had an overall length of 300ft (91.4m) a beam of 43ft 8in (13.31m) and a draught of 18ft 6in (5.64m). Displacement was 3,600 long tons (3,700t). She was one of 10 ships of the class that was sheathed in wood and copper to reduce fouling. An armoured deck of between 1+1⁄4 inches (32mm) and 2 inches (51mm) protected the ship's magazines and machinery, while the ship's conning tower had 3 inches (76mm) of armour and the gunshields 4+1⁄2 inches (110mm). Two QF 6-inch (152mm) guns were mounted fore and aft on the ship's centreline, while six 4.7 in (120mm) guns were mounted three on each broadside. 8 six pounder guns and 1 three pounder provided protection against torpedo boats. Sirius was laid down in September 1889, launched on 27 October 1890 and entered service in September 1891. Sirius served off America from 1892 to 1895 and on the China Station from 1903 to 1905. On return from overseas, she went into reserve at Devonport. In February 1912, Sirius became part of the training squadron. In October 1914 Sirius was one of a number of obsolete warships deployed to support Belgian troops during the Battle of the Yser, carrying out shore bombardments from 23 October. Sirius served as part of the Nore Command from 1914 to March 1915, being used as a guard ship on the east coast of the United Kingdom, and was then sent to serve off West Africa, where she remained on station until 1918. In April 1918, Sirius was scuttled in the mouth of Ostend harbour in Belgium during the failed First Ostend Raid. This operation was intended to block the harbour mouth and prevent the transit of German U-boats and other raiding craft from Bruges to the North Sea. German countermeasures were too effective, however, and Sirius and her sister ship and fellow blockship HMSBrilliant were eventually scuttled by their crews outside the harbour mouth on 23 April 1918 after running aground on a sandbank. The wrecks were broken up after the war.",Normal

Much of this work centered around the ""stress process model"", a model he developed to attempt to explain the relationship between stress and mental health. He earned his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1956. He worked at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) for over two decades, where he worked with such researchers as Melvin L. Kohn and Carmi Schooler to study the sociology of mental health. In 1982, he left the NIMH to join the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) as professor in the Human Development and Aging Program, of which he served as director from 1982 to 1984. He was also the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Health and Social Behavior from 1982 to 1984. In 1994, he retired from UCSF to join the University of Maryland as a graduate professor and senior research scientist; he remained a professor there until his retirement in 2007. In 2000, he and his wife, Gerrie, established the Leonard I. Pearlin Award for Distinguished Contributions to the Sociological Study of Mental Health, which is given by the Section on the Sociology of Mental Health of the American Sociological Association.

"In Greek mythology, Neoptolemus (ˌniːəpˈtɒlɪməs; Ancient Greek: Νεοπτόλεμος, romanized:Neoptólemos, lit. 'new warrior'), originally called Pyrrhus at birth (ˈpɪrəs; Πύρρος, Pýrrhos, 'red'), was the son of the warrior Achilles and the princess Deidamia, and the brother of Oneiros. He became the mythical progenitor of the ruling dynasty of the Molossians of ancient Epirus. In a reference to his pedigree, Neoptolemus was sometimes called Achillides (from his father Achilles' name) or, from his grandfather's or great-grandfather's names, Pelides or Aeacides. In his Chronography the chronicler Malalas described Neoptolemus as ""of good stature, good chest, thin, white, good nose, ruddy hair, wooly hair, light-eyed, big-eyed, blond eyebrows, blond beginnings of a beard, round-faced, precipitate, daring, agile, a fierce fighter"". Meanwhile, in the account of Dares the Phrygian, he was described as ""large, robust, and easily irritated. He lisped slightly, and was good-looking, with a hooked nose, round eyes, and shaggy eyebrows"". In Cypria, Achilles sails to Skyros after a failed expedition to Troy, marries princess Deidamia and fathers Neoptolemus with her before being called to arms yet again. In a non-Homeric version of the story, Achilles' mother Thetis had a vision many years before Achilles' birth that there would be a great war, and that her only son was to die in it if he partook. She tried to prevent him from being called to fight in the Trojan War by hiding him, disguised as a woman, in the court of Lycomedes, the king of Skyros. During his stay, Achilles had an affair with the princess, Deidamea, who then gave birth to Neoptolemus (originally called Pyrrhus, because his father had called himself Pyrrha, the female version of that name, while disguised as a woman). Most accounts mention Deidamia being Neoptolemus' mother, but in some accounts, he was the son of Achilles by Iphigenia instead. In those accounts, his father transported him to the island of Skyros after the sacrifice of his mother. The Greeks captured the Trojan seer Helenus and forced him to tell them under what conditions they could take Troy. Helenus revealed to them that they could defeat Troy if they could acquire the poisonous arrows of Heracles (then in the possession of Philoctetes); steal the Palladium (which led to the building of the famous wooden horse of Troy); and put Achilles' son in the war. The Greeks then sent Odysseus to retrieve Neoptolemus, then a mere teenager, from Skyros. The two then went to Lemnos to retrieve Philoctetes (years earlier, on the way to Troy, Philoctetes had been bitten by a snake on Chryse Island). Agamemnon had advised that he be left behind because the wound was festering and smelled bad. Philoctetes' retrieval is the plot of Philoctetes, a play by Sophocles. Some sources portray Neoptolemus as brutal. He killed at least six on the field of battle  and several more during the subsequent fall of Troy (Priam, Eurypylus, Polyxena, Polites and Astyanax (Hector and Andromache's infant son) among others). He captured Helenus, and made Andromache his concubine. The ghost of Achilles appeared to the survivors of the war, demanding the Trojan princess Polyxena to be sacrificed before anybody could leave for home; Neoptolemus was the one to carry out the sacrifice. (In scene (ll 566–575) of Euripides' play Hekabe (also known as Hecuba) Neoptolemus is shown as a torn young man who kills Polyxena in the least painful way possible, contrasting with his usual brutal and uncompassionate image.) With Andromache, Helenus and Phoenix, Neoptolemus then sailed to the Epirot Islands and became the king of Epirus. By the enslaved Andromache, daughter of Cilician king Eëtion, Neoptolemus was the father of Molossos (and, according to the myth, therefore an ancestor of Olympias, the mother of Alexander the Great), Pielus, Pergamus and Amphialus. Hyginus has a section on Amphialus: Neoptolemus, son of Achilles and Deidamia, begat Amphialus by captive Andromache, daughter of Ēëtion. But after he heard that Hermione his betrothed had been given to Orestes in marriage, he went to Lacedaemon and demanded her from Menelaus. Menelaus did not wish to go back on his word, and took Hermione from Orestes and gave her to Neoptolemus. Orestes, thus insulted, slew Neoptolemus as he was sacrificing to Delphi, and recovered Hermione. The bones of Neoptolemus were scattered through the land of Ambracia, which is in the district of Epirus. By Lanassa, granddaughter of Heracles, he fathered eight children. Like in Euripides' Hekabe, Sophocles' Philoctetes also shows him as a much kinder man, who honours his promises and shows remorse when he is made to trick Philoctetes. There are two differing accounts of Neoptolemus' death: he was either killed after he attempted to take Hermione from Orestes, or after he denounced Apollo, the murderer of his father. In the first case, he was killed by Orestes; in the second, the Delphic priest of Apollo named Machaereus took revenge. After Neoptolemus' death his kingdom was partitioned. According to Virgil's Aeneid, Helenus (who later married Andromache) took part of it: ""Helenus, a son of Priam, was king over these Greek cities of Epirus, having succeeded to the throne and bed of Pyrrhus..."" Mentioned briefly in Euripides' plays Trojan Women and Hecuba, simply stating that Andromache, wife of Hector, was his promised spear bride.",Normal

"Williamston is a town and the county seat of Martin County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 5,104 at the 2021 census. It is located in North Carolina's Inner Banks region. The closest major city is Greenville, approximately 28mi to the southwest. Williamston was founded in 1779, and named after William Williams, a local military commander during the American Revolution. Williamston was the focus of activity in the Civil Rights Movement. Beginning in June 1963, civil rights activists protested at City Hall for 29 consecutive days led by Golden Frinks. The Ku Klux Klan was very active in this part of the state during this time, including a well-documented rally in Williamston on October 5, 1963, attended by mostly local residents but with several carloads of attendees traveling over 150 miles to attend. On August 3, 2023, Martin General Hospital in Williamston announced that it would suspend operations due to Quorum Health, which operated the hospital, filing for bankruptcy. The hospital said that it faced challenges due to a declining population and residents opting to go to other hospitals. The next day, former hospital employees organized a protest after its closure. They said the goal was to get the attention of an elected official in hopes they would rethink the decision of the hospital being shut down. On August 14-15, Governor Roy Cooper visited Williamston to hold roundtable discussions about the lack of access of medical care in rural areas. He used the recent closure of the hospital as an example of why he supported expanding Medicaid across rural areas of North Carolina. On October 5, four clinics in Williamston also closed, further adding to the current healthcare crisis in the town.

"Wolf Solent is a novel by John Cowper Powys (1872–1963) that was written while he was based in Patchin Place, New York City, and travelling around the US as a lecturer. It was published by Simon and Schuster in May 1929 in New York. The British edition, published by Jonathan Cape, appeared in July 1929. This, Powys's fourth novel, was his first literary success. It is a bildungsroman in which the eponymous protagonist, a thirty-five-year-old history teacher, returns to his birthplace, where he discovers the inadequacy of his dualistic philosophy. Wolf resembles John Cowper Powys in that an elemental philosophy is at the centre of his life and, because, like Powys, he hates science and modern inventions like cars and planes, and is attracted to slender, androgynous women. Wolf Solent is the first of Powys's four Wessex novels. Powys both wrote about the same region as Thomas Hardy and was a twentieth-century successor to the great nineteenth-century novelist. The novel is set in the fictional towns of Ramsgard, Dorset, based on Sherborne, Dorset, where Powys attended school from May 1883, Blacksod, modelled on Yeovil, Somerset, and Kings Barton, modelled on Bradford Abbas, Dorset. It has references to other places in Dorset like Dorchester and Weymouth that were also full of memories for Powys. Wolf Solent was Powys's first successful novel. There were six impressions of the first edition (American) between 1929 and 1930 and three of the British edition in 1929. There were translations into German (1930, French (1931), and several other European languages. However, Powys had to cut 318 pages from his typescript before Wolf Solent was published by Simon and Schuster. These pages (amounting to six chapters) were hastily condensed into a revised chapter 19 ‘Wine’ for its first publication. They were eventually published with editorial commentary in July 2021, but no attempt has been made as yet to incorporate them into an updated complete Wolf Solent. Some variations to the plot — particularly the disfigurement of Gerda, which is only referred to in the deleted chapters — make such an integration problematic. Following the success of Wolf Solent three of Powys's works of popular philosophy were also best-sellers: The Meaning of Culture (1929), In Defence of Sensuality (1930), A Philosophy of Solitude (1933). Prior to this Powys had published three apprentice novels: Wood and Stone (1915), Rodmoor (1916), Ducdame (1925), and had also written After My Fashion in 1920, though it was not published until 1980. He had begun work on Wolf Solent in February 1925, It is ""the first of the four Wessex novels which established John Cowper Powys's reputation"", an allusion not only to the place but to the influence of Thomas Hardy on him: his first novel, Wood and Stone was dedicated to Hardy. In the Preface he wrote for the 1961 Macdonald edition of the novel Powys states: ""Wolf Solent is a book of Nostalgia, written in a foreign country with the pen of a traveller and the ink-blood of his home. Wolf Solent is set in Ramsgard, based on Sherborne, Dorset, where Powys attended school from May 1883, as well as Blacksod, modelled on Yeovil, Somerset, and Dorchester, Dorset and Weymouth, Dorset, both in Dorset, all places full of memories for him. While Powys had been born in Shirley, Derbyshire and lived there for this first seven years of his life, his father then returned to his home county of Dorset, and, after a brief stay in Weymouth, the family resided in Dorchester from May 1880 until the Christmas of 1885. Powys's paternal grandmother lived in nearby Weymouth. For the rest of his youth Powys lived in Montacute, just over the Dorset border in Somerset. Also in the 1961 Preface Powys records the fact that he and his brother Littleton would often ""scamper home"" on a Sunday from school in Sherborne via Yeovil: ""Sherborne was five miles from Montacute; and Yeovil was five miles from Montacute"". The seaside resort of Weymouth is the main setting of his novel Weymouth Sands (1934, published as Jobber Skald in England) while Maiden Castle (1935), which alludes to Thomas Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge, is set in Dorchester (Hardy's Casterbridge). Powys had first settled in Dorchester, after returning from America in 1934. These two works, along with Wolf Solent and A Glastonbury Romance (1932) make up Powys's four main Wessex novels. A Further indication of the importance of familiar places in Powys's fiction is that Glastonbury is just a few miles north of Montacute. The novel begins with its eponymous, thirty-five-year-old hero on a train returning to his native Dorset to Ramsgard (Sherborne). This follows the loss of his job as a history teacher in London, following an outburst in class in which “he found himself pouring forth a torrent of wild, indecent invective upon every aspect of modern civilization”. This nervous collapse had been triggered by a look of “inert despair” that he had seen on the face of a man on the steps of Waterloo station in London. He is journeying back to his childhood hometown because he has been hired as a “literary assistant” by the squire of nearby King’s Barton. Wolf in “escaping from an insensitive, brutal world and trivial world” of London, is moving to a place “where he will have a greater freedom to know and be himself”. This is also a homecoming for him, as he left Ramsgard with his mother when he was ten and it is the place where his father died. In Ramsgard he feels “free of his mother” with whom he has always lived and whom he left in London and “Bound up in some strange affiliation with that skeleton  in the  cemetery”. In due course Wolf discovers that his father had sunk from being a respected history teacher and had died in the Ramsgard workhouse “in obscure circumstances after some ‘depravity’”, which involved the pornographic bookseller Malakite, Wolf also finds out that his father had had several affairs, and that Wolf has a half-sister, and that Malakite had an incestuous relationship with his elder daughter. Peter Easingwood suggests, that “nderlying ‘’Wolf Solent’’ is a sensuous-mystical feeling for the natural world that goes with an attempted rejection of human society”. However, Wolf cannot escape human involvement. He has to work, and this involves him in a moral dilemma, because he comes to believe that Squire Urquhart is “the embodiment of evil” and his planned book dangerously immoral. Furthermore, he cannot escape the influence of his mother. Wolf had assured her that she could join him ""when I've got a cottage"" but she arrives unexpectedly in Dorset earlier than Wolf had planned. But, more seriously he cannot, through his sensuous pleasure in nature, escape from his body and in particular sex, and Wolf soon becomes involved with two women: ""Gerda, the child of nature, whom he marries, and the more intellectual and complex Christie"", the younger daughter of Malakite. It therefore appears that Wolf Solent is ""designed to show how Solent has chosen Dorset as his best retreat, only to find himself cornered"". Or, as another writer suggests: ""The landscape and the emotional intimacies of his relationships in Dorset manage to attack  inner life as no physical or personal contact in London had done"". Wolf Solent is a novel that focuses on the inner psychic tensions in its protagonist's life, central to this is what Wolf calls his ""mythology"": ""Wolf has taken refuge in a mythological world of his own invention; and at the heart of his 'mythology' there is a struggle between good and evil, seen in the black and white terms of conventional morality"". By the end of the novel Wolf realizes that he and his wife Gerda have little in common and ""that he has confused love with 'a mixture of lust and romance'"", and that he should have married Christie Malakite. However, he had believed ""that any closer involvement with Christie  would destroy his 'mythology"" and his stubborn clinging to this idea ruins their relationship. Wolf at the end faces the loss of his ""mythology"" and questions how human beings can ""go on living, when their live-illusion was destroyed"". Suicide seems a possibility, but the novel ends with Wolf having ""a kind of vision"" involving a field of golden buttercups, and realizing ""that traditional morality"" the kind his ""mythology"" operated under ""is too simple"". ""Powys's vision is not tragic but essentially comic-grotesque"". The final words of Wolf Solent — ""Well, I shall have a cup of tea"" — have been described by Peter Easingwood as ""notoriously bathetic"". According to Robert Timlin however, ""Once its significance in the context of the book as a whole is understood, for Powys to end with Wolf planning to have a cup of tea can be regarded as neither an example of bathos nor an arbitrary decision but an entirely appropriate finish. A light touch, yes, but hardly without resonance."" An important recurring image in the novel is that of the face on the steps of Waterloo Station in London, which precipitates Wolf's emotion collapse in front of his history class, and loss of his job. The face of ""a man regarded by Wolf as an epitome of the kind of suffering which challenges belief in a benevolent creator"". In a letter to his brother Llewelyn, written from Chicago on 18 February 1925, in which Powys mentions working on Wolf Solent, he refers to a beggar that he had seen with ""a 'shocking' face"". Professor Peter Easingwood suggests that from this encounter came the idea for the face which forms such a ""dominant pattern of symbolic imagery"" in the novel. This face ""of inert despair"" is seen by Wolf as linked to ""the appalling misery of so many of his fellow Londoners"". Morine Krissdottir in her biography of Powys, Descents of Memory, dates the action of the novel as taking place between March 1921 and May 1922, just three years after the end of World War I and notes that a ""triumphal Victory Arch"" was formally opened as the main entrance to Waterloo Station in London on 21 March 1922, to be a memorial to the dead. She also records that ""in an ironic twist, the steps  soon became a place where beggars, many of them mentally and physically crippled ex-servicemen, gathered"". Furthermore, she also suggests that while there is no direct reference to the war in Wolf Solent ""the metaphors and imagery"" do in fact allude to it, and that ""he novel is in fact about a world after the great war--a world in which everything is irrevocably changed"". In his review of the British first edition, in The Spectator, 10 August 1929, writer and critic V. S. Pritchett wrote: Wolf Solent is a stupendous and rather glorious book  The book is as beautiful and strange as an electric storm, and like the thunder on the Sinai, it is somewhat of a sermon."" More recently, also in The Spectator, A. N. Wilson wrote: ""The Wessex novels of John Cowper Powys — Wolf Solent (1929), A Glastonbury Romance (1933), Jobber Skald (also published as Weymouth Sands, 1935) and Maiden Castle (1937) — must rank as four of the greatest ever to be written in our language."" In his Introduction to the Penguin Classics edition of the book, A.N. Wilson asserts that Wolf Solent is a ""great literary masterpiece"". However, Wilson also notes that ""this kind of writing is not going to appeal to every reader"", and John Cowper Powys ""has been expunged from the canon of English literature. The author and journalist Simon Heffer considers Wolf Solent ""to be the finest novel by an Englishman in the 20th century"". However, Heffer also notes that Powys' name remains little known.

"In Norse mythology, helskór (""hel-shoes"") were purportedly placed on the dead so that they could walk to Valhalla. The custom is mentioned in Gísla saga Súrssonar (14) when Vésteinn is buried: The Norse tradition preserved in Gisla saga Surssonar in regard to the importance for the dead to be provided with shoes reappears as a popular tradition in several places  That Hel-shoes were to be had for those who were not supplied with them, but still deserved them, is probably a genuine mythological idea. Visio Godeschalci describes a journey to the underworld made by a Holstein peasant named Godeskalk, who belonged to the generation immediately preceding the one converted to Christianity. There he saw an immensely large and beautiful linden-tree hanging full of shoes, which were handed down to such dead travellers as had exercised mercy during their lives. When the dead had passed this tree they had to cross a heath two miles (3km) wide, thickly grown with thorns, and then they came to a river full of irons with sharp edges. The unjust had to wade through this river, and suffered immensely. They were cut and mangled in every limb; but when they reached the other strand, their bodies were the same as they had been when they began crossing the river. (Similarly, in the Eddic poem Sólarljóð (42), a dying skald hears the roaring of subterranean streams mixed with blood). The just are able to cross the river by putting their feet on boards a foot wide and fourteen feet long, which floated on the water. This is the first day's journey. On the second day they come to a point where the road forked into three ways - one to heaven, one to hell, and one between these realms.",Normal

"The Bemaraha Formation is a Middle Jurassic (early Bajocian to early Bathonian) geological formation of the Morondava Basin of Madagascar. The lime mudstones, grainstones and limestones of the formation were deposited in lagoonal and reefal environments. Fossils of groups of invertebrates and theropod and sauropod tracks have been found in the formation. The Sahalaly River tracksite yielded a single trackway belonging to a quadrupedal dinosaur, possibly a sauropod. Sauropod tracks are rare, making up as little as 1 percent of the present sample. The best-preserved tracks are assigned to the ichnogenus Kayentapus. The limestones of the Bemaraha Formation have been interpreted as a coastal barrierlagoon complex of Middle Jurassic age (Bajocian, about 170 Ma). At that time, Madagascar had already separated from Africa, but was still attached to India and Antarctica. Since Antarctica was connected to southern Africa, a land bridge really existed between Madagascar and all major southern hemisphere landmasses. Faunal exchanges were possible and endemism was probably very low. Madagascar was to become an island only some 80-90 million years later, during the Late Cretaceous. During Bajocian times, a narrow seaway stretched between eastern Africa and western Madagascar, much in the same position as today's Mozambique Channel. Along the shores of western Madagascar, coral reefs separated wide lagoons from the open sea. The remnants of this reeflagoon complex is what today, after the coastline shifted several tens of kilometers westward, is seen in the limestones of the Bemaraha Formation. The Bemaraha limestones stretches over an area of roughly 300 kilometres (190mi), and are best exposed in the area between the towns of Bekopaka and Antsalova, in the northern half of the Morondava Basin. The outcropping limestones can roughly be divided into a western and an eastern belt with different facies. In the western belt, the formation mainly consists of massive limestones with metre-scale bedding or no recognizable bedding at all. Oolites and fossils of reefal organisms (mainly corals) are common in places. This region is affected by the spectacular karst features known as ""tsingy"" and for this reason most of the area is part of the Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park, included in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list. The facies in the eastern belt is made up mainly of fine-grained and well-bedded limestones with the average thickness of the individual beds being a few tens of centimeters. Beds are often laminated and invertebrate fossils (gastropods, bivalves, brachiopods, echinoids and isolated coral fragments) are common in some beds, while others are devoid of fossils. In the south-western Majunga Basin, interbedded limestones and mudstones (shales and marls) above the Aalenian Sandstone were attributed to a Bajocian carbonate platform formed by the Bemaraha Formation. The carbonate platform at the Manambolo and Tsiribihina River gorges, which cut through the Bemaraha plateau, are likewise assigned to the Early Bajocian. At the eastern margin of the Bemaraha Plateau, the carbonate succession directly rests on Isalo sandstones. Farther south at Besabora (along National Road RN35), limestones with the foraminifera Mesoendothyra croatica and Protopeneroplis striata support a Middle Jurassic (Bajocian to Early Bathonian) age.",Normal

"Empress Xiaojing (孝景皇后, 180s? BC – 25 June 126 BC), of the Wang clan, also known by her birth name Wang Zhi (王娡) and by the title MadameWang (王夫人), was an empress during the Han dynasty. She was the second wife of Emperor Jing and the mother of Emperor Wu. She was also the first known empress of China who was previously married to another man before becoming empress. Wang Zhi was born to Wang Zhong (王仲) and Zang Er (臧兒), who was a granddaughter of Zang Tu, the one-time King of Yan appointed by Xiang Yu until the fifth year of Emperor Gaozu (202 BC). Zang Tu rebelled against the Emperor and was defeated. He and his entire family was massacred, but Zang Er managed to escape. Wang Zhi's parents had, in addition to her, an older son, Wang Xin (王信) and a younger daughter, Wang Erxu (王兒姁). They lived in Huaili (槐里, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). After her father died, her mother remarried a man surnamed Tian (田), and had two more sons: Tian Fen (田蚡) and Tian Sheng (田勝). When Wang Zhi was young, she was married to a local man named Jin Wangsun (金王孫), and had a daughter named Jin Su (金俗). However, her mother was told by a soothsayer that both of her daughters would become extremely honoured. Zang Er decided to offer her daughters to the crown prince, Liu Qi, and, to do so, forcibly divorced Wang Zhi from her husband. Wang Zhi was then sent along with her sister, Wang Erxu, to the Crown Prince's palace to join his concubinage. After being offered to the Crown Prince, both Wang Zhi and Wang Erxu became favoured. She then bore him three daughters: Grand Princess Yangxin (陽信長公主), Princess Nangong (南宮公主) and Princess Longlü (隆慮公主), and later a son named Liu Che (劉徹) who was still in the womb when Liu Qi ascended to the throne as Emperor Jing of Han after Emperor Wen's death in July 157 BC. Her sister bore Liu Qi four sons: Liu Yue, Prince Hui of Guangchuan (廣川惠王 劉越), Liu Ji, Prince Kang of Jiaodong (膠東康王 劉寄), Liu Cheng, Prince Ai of Qinghe (清河哀王 劉乘), and Liu Shun, Prince Xian of Changshan (常山憲王 劉舜). When Wang Zhi was pregnant with Liu Che, she claimed that she dreamed that the sun had fallen into her womb. Emperor Jing was ecstatic over the divine implication, and made Liu Che (his 10th son) the Prince of Jiaodong (膠東王) in May 153 BC. Wang Zhi was also promoted to a consort for giving birth to a royal prince. Emperor Jing's formal wife, Empress Bo, was childless. As a result, Emperor Jing's oldest son Liu Rong (劉榮), born of the Emperor's other favourite concubine, Lady Li (栗姬), was created crown prince in May 153 BC. Lady Li, feeling certain that her son would become the emperor, grew arrogant and intolerant, and frequently threw tantrums at Emperor Jing out of jealousy over his favouring of other concubines. Her lack of tact would prove to be Consort Wang's chance. When Emperor Jing's older sister, Elder Princess Guantao (館陶長公主) Liu Piao (劉嫖), offered to marry her daughter Chen Jiao (陳嬌) to Liu Rong, Lady Li rudely rejected the proposal, complaining that Princess Guantao often offered new concubines as prostitutes to Emperor Jing. Angered by this snub, Elder Princess Guantao encouraged Emperor Jing not to favour Lady Li. Consort Wang, who had been observing quietly and waiting for her chance, took the opportunity and secured a marriage alliance by offering to marry her 5-year-old son Liu Che with Chen Jiao. Now siding with Consort Wang, Princess Guantao constantly criticised Lady Li in front of Emperor Jing. Gradually accepting his sister's concerns, Emperor Jing decided to test out Lady Li. One day he asked Lady Li that whether she would happily look after and properly raise the rest of his children if he was to pass away, only to have Lady Li rudely (and foolishly) refuse to comply. This made Emperor Jing angry and he became worried that if Liu Rong was to inherit the throne and Lady Li became Empress Dowager, many of his concubines might suffer the fate of Consort Qi. Seizing the opportunity, Consort Wang put in place the final straw against Lady Li. She persuaded a minister to advise Emperor Jing to make Lady Li empress as Liu Rong was already the crown prince. Emperor Jing, already of the view that Lady Li must not be made empress, was enraged and believed that Lady Li had conspired with government officials. He executed that minister who put forward that proposal, and demoted Liu Rong to the Prince of Linjiang (臨江王) in 150 BC and exiled him out of the capital city Chang'an. Lady Li was stripped of her titles and placed under house arrest, and died of frustration and depression not long after. Since Empress Bo's deposition one year earlier, the position of empress was open. Emperor Jing, who had always considered Liu Che to be his favourite son, soon made Consort Wang empress on 6 June. Liu Che, now legally the oldest son of the Empress, was later made crown prince on 18 June. Remembering the lesson of Empress Bo's and Lady Li's fate, despite her highest rank and honoured position as empress, Empress Wang did not try to assert as much influence on her husband as her mother-in-law, Empress Dowager Dou, had asserted over her father-in-law, Emperor Wen. Although Empress Wang was her husband's favorite and Liu Che was Emperor Jing's heir and favorite son, she was very tolerant and submissive of her mother-in-law and sister-in-law because of her and her son's position. She had good relations with her mother-in-law, and both she and her brother Wang Xin played important parts in calming Emperor Jing over his anger against his younger brother Liu Wu (劉武), the Prince Xiao of Liang, and the favoured young son of Empress Dowager Dou, when Liu Wu assassinated a number of court officials in 148 BC for opposing the proposal to have him appointed the heir apparent. It was because of this that Empress Dowager Dou wanted to create Wang Xin a marquess, a move initially blocked by his prime minister, Zhou Yafu (周亞夫), although Emperor Jing eventually carried out the promotion of Wang Xin. She was probably pleased when Zhou Yafu committed suicide in 143 BC after being falsely accused of treason and arrested. When Emperor Jing died in March 141 BC, Crown Prince Che succeeded to the throne as Emperor Wu, and Empress Wang became empress dowager. After Empress Wang became empress dowager, her son carried out several immediate acts to honour her family members. Her mother Lady Zang Er was created the Lady of Pingyuan, and her half-brothers were created marquesses. Her daughter Jin Su, from her previous marriage, was tracked down and personally visited by Emperor Wu, and he created her the Lady of Xiucheng (修成君). She was awarded 300 servants, 100 acres of land, and a grand mansion. Jin Su's daughter was married to a prince. Empress Dowager Wang exerted significant influence on her son. For example, with her approval, her half-brother Tian Fen became the commander of the armed forces and exerted power even beyond the military affairs. Initially, her influence was balanced and outweighed by that of her mother-in-law, Grand Empress Dowager Dou. With Grand Empress Dowager Dou's death in June 135 BC, Empress Dowager Wang became the paramount figure at court. Later in 135 BC Tian Fen was made prime minister, although her son gradually justified this position as he matured. For example, in 133 BC, in the aftermath of the failed attempt to capture the Xiongnu Chanyu at the Battle of Mayi, Emperor Wu wanted to execute the key strategist, Wang Hui (王恢, unrelated to her), who bribed Tian, who in turn persuaded her to speak on Wang Hui's behalf. Emperor Wu refused to accept her intercession, and forced Wang Hui to commit suicide. However, it was at her behest that Emperor Wu executed his grand uncle Dou Ying (竇嬰) (Empress Dou's cousin) in 132 BC for having insulted Tian. Empress Dowager Wang died in June 126 BC, and was buried with her second husband Emperor Jing.",Normal
"This is a list of political parties in Singapore, including existing and historical ones. The earliest political parties were established in the lead-up to Singapore first Legislative Council elections in 1948. Singapore is a republic. While the country has a multi-party system, the dominant political party have often been the People's Action Party since 1965, along with the main opposition party, the Workers' Party. Minority governments are uncommon, as elections have not resulted in a hung parliament since independence. Legislative power is vested in parliament, which consists of the president as its head and a single chamber whose members are elected by popular vote. The role of the president as the head of state has been, historically, largely ceremonial although the constitution was amended in 1991 to give the president some veto powers in a few key decisions such as the use of the national reserves, as well as the appointment of key judiciary, civil service and Singapore Armed Forces posts. They also exercise powers over national security matters. Singapore has consistently been rated as the least-corrupt country in Asia and globally amongst the top five by Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, and the degree of accountability and transparency is reflected in the public's high level of satisfaction with the political institutions. Thomas Friedman of the New York Times also considers the country's civil service to be one of the most efficient and uncorrupt bureaucracies in the world, with a high standard of discipline and accountability. The World Bank's governance indicators have also rated Singapore highly on rule of law, control of corruption and government effectiveness. Amongst the oldest parties, the Malay Union, traced its history back to 14 May 1926, was initially a non-political association as the party only participated in the 1955 election. The Progressive Party and Labour Party, both established in the late 1940s, were some of the pioneering local establishments, with the PP the only party to contest in the first elections in 1948, and the LP coming on board in 1951. By 1955, the fledgling British colony had seven parties contesting, and reached a pinnacle of 13 parties in 1959. A total of three parties were established in the 1940s, 12 in the 1950s and five in the 1960s. Post-independence Singapore saw the dominance of the People's Action Party, which first came into power in 1959. On 16 May 1960, a new Societies Ordinance was passed, and in December 1966, local parties were forbidden from being affiliated to foreign ones. This directly impacted the handful of small parties with links to Malaysia, most of which renamed themselves andor cut formal foreign ties. The PAP's dominance stemming from Singapore's economic advancement further weakened the smaller opposition parties, with a majority of Singaporeans voting for the PAP in subsequent elections. Still, new parties continued to be established, and to date, there are therefore a total of 30 registered political parties today, of which ten have never contested in an election, 13 parties have officially dissolved with most through mergers with other parties. A few opposition parties, those of Workers' Party and Singapore Democratic Party, had gained some success towards the 80s with the captures of its safe seat of Hougang and Potong Pasir respectively, with the former went with further success heading towards the 21st century. Over the years, alliances between political parties existed, however short-lived. Presently, only one functioning multi-party alliance, the Singapore Democratic Alliance, which was formed on 3 July 2001, initially composed of the Singapore People's Party (SPP), National Solidarity Party (NSP), Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura and the Justice Party, Singapore, with the SPP being the lead party. The vision was to bring all opposition parties under one banner to counter the PAP's dominance, but it was met with limited success due to opposition infighting. The NSP left the alliance in 2007, and in 2010, the SPP itself left when there was internal disagreements over the SPP's attempts to bring in the newly formed Reform Party (RP). Many party members have resigned from its former parties and later formed newer parties over the years following the aftermath of its respective general elections, notably People's Power Party (PPP) formed by former WP and NSP member Goh Meng Seng in 2015, the Peoples Voice (PV) by former-National Solidarity Party's Secretary general Lim Tean in 2018, the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) in 2019 by former People's Action Party Member of Parliament Tan Cheng Bock, Red Dot United (RDP) in 2020 by former PSP members Ravi Philemon and Michelle Lee, and Singapore United Party (SUP) by former RP members in 2021. Under the current legislation, all political parties (termed ""Political Associations"") must be registered under the Societies Act. As such, the following rules pertaining to political associations apply: The government has the power to dissolve the party if it contravenes the above rules, or any other rule applicable to all forms of registered societies. Under the Political Donations Act which came into force on 15 February 2001, Political Associations are also barred from accepting any donation in cash or kind from impermissible donors, or from anonymous donors where the value exceeds S$5,000. The government announced that it was to ""prevent foreigners from interfering in domestic politics through the financial support for any association's cause"", and cited an example of a case in 1959 when S$700,000 was sent to Chew Swee Kee, then Education Minister from the Singapore People's Alliance by a ""neighbouring intelligence service in a ""black operation"" against the interests of Singapore"". Another case was also cited pertaining to foreign financial support for Francis Seow of the Workers' Party in 1988. The People's Action Party donated $20,000 to Australian political parties through (Singtel-owned) Optus in 2010, although the motives and details of the donation remain unverified. There have been a total of 43 political parties (not including Malaysia's parties, those contested in both Malaysia and Singapore elections, or those which contested during Singapore's merger with Malaysia) in Singapore.

"The Dodge 50 Series, later known as the Renault 50 Series, were light commercial vehicles produced in the UK by Chrysler Europe and later Renault Véhicules Industriels between 1979 and 1993 as a replacement for the earlier Dodge Walk-Thru stepvan and smaller Dodge Spacevan cab-over van. The Dodge 50 series utilized the same cab as the American Dodge B series vans, however in a modified state catered for European regulations. The chassis however was British-deisgned and had no parts shared with the American van, being significantly bigger. The 50 series included a wide range of chassis and body configurations, including two distinctly different cab designs, and spanned the 3,500–7,500kg (7,700–16,500lb) revenue weight range. Various engines were offered, including the Perkins Phaser and 4.236. The RB44, a four-wheel-drive version based loosely on the Dodge van, was built by Reynolds Boughton (now known as Boughton Engineering) in the early 1990s. Bodybuilding companies converted many into various configurations from tipper trucks to buses. Many were built as ""chassis cabs"" to have box bodies fitted; these were widely used by utility companies in the UK. They often came fitted with compressors and generators. Gradually this kind of vehicle fell out of favour, partly due to reliability issues relating to combining plant equipment with the vehicle drivetrain. The vehicle is otherwise toughly built. The utility companies today favour smaller vans with towed generators. The four-wheel-drive version saw some use with the British army since it was one of very few British-built trucks of the class, and it could carry considerably more cargo and equipment than even the largest Land Rover models. Chrysler received financial assistance from the British Government which was desperate to support the ailing British motor industry. However, having inherited various struggling car and commercial vehicle marques (and factories) from the Rootes Group, notably the commercial marques Commer and Karrier, in addition to various French concerns, Chrysler Europe struggled to return a profit. In 1978, Chrysler pulled out of their European operations altogether, selling them to Peugeot. The cars and small vans were subsequently sold under the Talbot brand. Peugeot had little interest in larger commercial vehicles and the factory for the heavier models was run in partnership with Renault Véhicules Industriels, who sought a UK production site for engines for their existing Renault-branded models. They continued to manufacture the 50 Series, along with the small Dodge (formerly Commer) Spacevan, and the large Dodge 100 Commando 2 Series of 7,500–23,000kg (16,500–50,700lb) trucks. The transition to Renault branding was gradual, with some vehicles bearing both a Dodge name and a Renault diamond badge. By 1987, the 50 Series had been updated and was badged as the Renault 50 Series; the UK incarnation of the Dodge marque ceased to be used for new vehicles. (Chrysler maintained an entirely separate Dodge brand in the U.S., and in 2006 began re-introducing Dodge car models from the USA into the UK market.) Renault continued to manufacture the 50 Series until 1993, but it was never a great sales success, even being forced to compete with other Renault products, in the form of the Master van, which Renault favoured in its export markets. In 1994, Renault — keen to clear the factory for large-scale engine production — sold the production tooling to a Chinese manufacturer.",Normal
"Urgehal (ˈjʊərɡəˌhæl) is a Norwegian black metal band formed in Hønefoss in 1992 by lead guitaristvocalist Trond Bråthen ('Trondr Nefas') and rhythm guitarist 'Enzifer'. Before their split up in 2016, they released seven full-length albums, four EPs and two demos. The band has since reformed in 2022, in honor of former members. Their style and sound is strongly influenced by the Norwegian black metal scene of the early 1990s, and Enzifer has called Norwegian band Darkthrone their biggest inspiration. Other influences include ""old-school heavy, thrash, speed, death and black metal  and the old South American extreme metal scene"". Onstage, Urgehal wear traditional black metal attire, such as spiked wristbands, inverted crosses and corpse paint. Enzifer is also known for wearing a face mask with spikes protruding from it, which he says is used ""to mirror my inner darkness"". Urgehal define themselves as a ""Satanic"" band, explaining that they ""use Satan as a biblical and metaphorical expression of the inner evil of Man"". They explained their name as ""an expression in old Norse mythology"", describing it as ""an endless deep and dark forest where all the evil dwells"". Urgehal was formed by Trondr Nefas and Enzifer in 1992. They released two demos in 1994 and 1995. Early in 1996 they got a record deal with the German label No Colours and recorded their debut album Arma Christi the same year. The follow-up, Massive Terrestrial Strike, was released in 1997. The band then switched to the label Flesh For Beast. The album Atomkinder was released in 2001 and the next, Through Thick Fog 'till Death, was released in 2003. Flesh For Beast then retired and their fifth album, Goatcraft Torment, was released in 2006 through its sister label Agonia Records. Shortly after, a 15-year anniversary album called The Eternal Eclipse was released, containing rarities and a large photo booklet which traces the band's history. In 2007, the band signed to Season of Mist. Most of the songs for the next album were written that year. However, due to internal problems, the recording was stalled. The album, Ikonoklast, was finally released in early 2009. Guitaristvocalist Trondr Nefas died in May 2012, aged 34.

"Thunderbird is a steel roller coaster in the Thanksgiving section of Holiday World & Splashin' Safari amusement park in Santa Claus, Indiana. Designed by Bolliger & Mabillard, the ride opened in 2015 as the eighth Wing Coaster in the world and the fourth in the United States. Thunderbird is B&M's first launched coaster in sixteen years and their first launch coaster built in-house (The Incredible Hulk Coaster at Universal's Islands of Adventure uses a launch system supplied by the park). The Wing Coaster reaches a speed of 60 miles per hour (97kmh) in 3.5 seconds and features the tallest vertical loop on a Wing Coaster. Thunderbird had its first test run on March 8, 2015 and opened to the public on April 25, 2015. On July 24, 2014, Holiday World announced that they would be opening Thunderbird for the 2015 season. It would be the park's first major steel coaster, as well as the first launched wing coaster in the United States. Thunderbird would also be the first roller coaster at the park to go upside down. The track and supports began arriving at the park the following week. By October, the first two inversions were topped off. The new trains were shown off during IAAPA 2014. Then, the track layout was completed on December 2, 2014. Thunderbird officially opened on April 25, 2015. Prairie Farms Dairy released an ice cream flavor called ""Thunderbird"" to advertise the new ride. This flavor was a combination of vanilla ice cream with a touch of caramel and more spicy, roasted pecans. After loading in the station, the train moves forward and stops. Mist blows in front of the train and thunder sounds as the train launches from 0 to 60 miles per hour (97kmh) in 3.5 seconds by linear synchronous motors. The train immediately goes into a 140 feet (43m) Immelmann loop. After the first element, the train then goes down its first drop into a 125 feet (38m) vertical loop, the tallest vertical loop on a Wing Coaster, surpassing Wild Eagle at Dollywood. After the vertical loop, the train crosses over the valley between The Voyage's second and third hills, goes through an overbanked turn, and then an overbanked elevated spiral in the mirrored direction. The train then goes through a zero-g-roll parallel to The Voyage. After several curves next to The Voyage's triple-down drop and spaghetti bowl, the train dips down into a barn (which is the keyhole) where it then curves left back into the barn by doing an inline twist, crossing over The Voyage's underground tunnels. Once the inline twist ends the train enters the brake run. From the brake run, the track makes a right turn to another set of brakes before entering the station. One cycle of the ride lasts about 1 minute and 18 seconds. Thunderbird is located in the Thanksgiving theme section of the park along with The Voyage and it runs parallel and crosses over The Voyage twice: after the vertical loop and during the inline twist. PGAV Destinations is the theming designer for Thunderbird. The designers took the Thunderbird name and coaster design and created a visual theme of the legendary bird’s powerful flight through farms and forests of southern Indiana. Thunderbird is a Wing Coaster model manufactured by Swiss roller coaster firm Bolliger & Mabillard. It is Holiday World & Splashin' Safaris first major steel roller coaster. Thunderbird is the eighth Wing Coaster to be built and the fourth in the United States, the others being X-Flight at Six Flags Great America, Wild Eagle at Dollywood and GateKeeper at Cedar Point. Thunderbird is the first Bolliger & Mabillard coaster to utilize an LSM launch. An earlier launched coaster, The Incredible Hulk roller coaster at Islands of Adventure, Universal Orlando, utilizes a pinch-wheel drive system that was designed exclusively for Universal Studios by Universal Creative. Thunderbird operates with two open-air steel and fiberglass trains, each with five cars of four seats each, with two on each side of the track. Each train holds 20 riders and the ride has a capacity of about 1,140 riders per hour. Because the seats are on the side of the track, a cantilevered steel arm is used to support the wings. Thunderbird's steel track is 3,035 feet (925m) long and the tallest part of the ride is the first inversion, an Immelmann loop at 140 feet (43m).

"In a Monastery Garden is a piece of light classical music by Albert Ketèlbey, who composed it in 1915 after a visit to a real monastic garden, now the Benedictine monastery of St Augustine's Abbey, Chilworth in Surrey. It was especially successful when performed by Ronnie Ronalde who often performed it as his finale and sold over a million recordings. There are conflicting accounts of the origins of this piece. Here are four accounts: 1. From Franciscans Here and There, no.34: During Fr. Edgar's noviciate... a visit was made to Chilworth in 1910 by Fr. Edgar's brother, Joseph. The latter, as J.H. Larway, was a well-known music publisher... He brought with him to Chilworth on this 1910 visit a man who was at that time distinguished as a composer, conductor and musical editor: Albert Ketelbey... Joseph Larway and Albert Ketelbey were taken round the friary and grounds of Chilworth. During the tour of the woods Ketelbey turned to Joseph Larway and said ""I've got an idea. If I put it on paper, will you publish it."" The idea or inspiration was In a Monastery Garden. Between one thing and another some time elapsed before the various parts were ready for publication... In 1915 Joseph Larway... took out the copyright... What was the surprise Fr. Edgar had in store for his guests at the 1959 Jubilee of his 50 years in the Order? Notwithstanding the many moves a friar may have in 50 years Fr. Edgar went up to his cell to bring down a remnant he had stored, and saved from the wreck of many moves. It was the score of the original MS of Ketelbey's In a Monastery Garden... Asked if he would mind this original score going into the archives of the Province, Fr. Edgar not only agreed, but agreed most willingly, and handed over the MS, which was once described in a musical review as ""touching the hearts of millions of people""... 2. This account is included in the article In a Monastery Garden, by Albert W. Ketèlbey, in Music Masterpieces, Part 12, 18 March 1926, page 183: It is highly necessary to feel what one writes, and also to have the right kind of inspiration. When I was writing In a Monastery Garden, one of my most popular compositions, I was for the time being an imaginary monk, and as in my earlier days I had had certain ascetic inclinations it was not difficult to get myself into a suitable frame of mind. The first inspiration to write the piece came to me during a visit to Scarborough. I happened to drive over to Bridlington one day, and on the way I visited a beautiful old monastery. Its quietude and its aloofness from the gaiety of the world at its doors seemed to cry aloud for expression through the medium of the orchestra. I had an idea, and when I returned home I set to work to draw a musical picture of the scene as it had impressed itself upon my mind - the chanting of the monks, the serenity and calm of the landscape, and the emotional aspect generally. I have always thought it a great compliment that many clergymen have asked me to allow them to incorporate the ""chant"" section of the piece into their church services. 3. The following account was given in Radio Times, 4 September 1931, page 203: In a Monastery Garden was commissioned for performance in a seaside resort. The idea for it came to the composer during a visit to a monastery while out motoring. At first no publisher would take it unless Ketélbey  removed the Kyrie section: but later a publisher bowed to Ketélbey's will, and it became, Kyrie and all, one of the world's ""best sellers"". 4. Ketèlbey's colleague, Herbert C. Ridout, has the following in Behind the needle, 5: Looking over forty years of the gramophone (in The Gramophone, November 1940, page 132): It was in October 1915 that we issued a record of a then unknown work called In a Monastery Garden, and I think we must have been animated by the wish to give our friend Albert Ketelbey's piece a good send-off, because the coupling on the record was the more famous Destiny waltz. But there soon came a time when Monastery Garden stood quite well on its own merits, and became such a success that it pointed out a distinct path for its composer to follow. I know Albert Ketelbey would have preferred  to be identified with the more serious music he had composed and published (some of it under the nom-de-plume of Anton Vodorinski) and, but for a purely accidental happening in connection with his Monastery Garden, this might have well been the case. The story really began two years or so earlier and in a recording atmosphere, so it is quite apropos here. Among the members of the orchestra regularly employed by Ketelbey for recording was a clarinet player called Scoma. In the summer months every year, when orchestral engagements in London were at their lowest ebb, Scoma himself conducted an orchestra of his own in Bridlington during the holiday season. Being great friends with Ketelbey, Scoma asked him if he would write for him an original orchestral work that he could feature as a novelty in his seaside programmes. That was in 1912. After paying a visit to Scoma at Bridlington, Ketelbey conceived the idea of In a Monastery Garden and passed the manuscript to Scoma. The latter soon began to report in excited letters that the little work not only aroused enthusiasm when played, but that he was receiving enquiries as to its publication. Scoma repeated the performances the following season, and this time declared that he had been pestered with requests for it in published form, rather shrewdly, however, advising the composer against publication for the moment, urging patience until it had been thoroughly tried out. He played it yet a third year at Bridlington, but this time news of its reception had traveled to London independently, for Ketelbey was approached by several London publishers anxious to secure it. Eventually J.H. Larway was the publisher chosen - at Ketelbey's own terms! The lyrics of 1921 in the Indiana State archive are shown as follows; Through the misty twilight falling, Voices from afar are calling – Calling all the weary homeward to their rest, The evening bell is softly pealing, While from out the cloisters stealing, Comes this prayer of mercy, peaceful and so blest. KYRIE, ELEISON, Hope will bring to us its gladness, Faith shall take away all sadness, While the gates of day are closing in the West, Joy will come again with morning, Shadows pass, but love is dawning, God is Love and gives us all Eternal Rest. KYRIE, ELEISON  There appear to have been two pre-publication versions. The piano manuscript was with Edgar Larway at Chilworth, while the orchestral parts were with Enrico Scoma at Bridlington. Even after publication, there is one difference of harmony between the two versions that makes them incompatible. What none of these accounts mentions is that the first appearance of In a Monastery Garden nationwide was as the recording on Regal Records. This appeared in the Regal catalogue for May 1914, the year before the publication of the sheet music. This first recording uses a different orchestration from the published one, and has details closer to the piano version.",Normal
