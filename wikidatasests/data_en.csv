"A conspiracy is when there is a lot of people who are working on something in secret and they don't tell anybody about. It can also be a lie that starts as just an idea or a rumour, in order to trick people into doing something. It is also called a conspiracy theory, because sometimes it is just an idea that is not true and that is very difficult to prove or disprove because if it was true then it is supposed to be a secret, which provides an excuse for the lack of proof. There have been many conspiracies in the history of the world and they are usually connected to people trying to take things from other people without the other people noticing until it is too late. There are a lot of conspiracy theories because anybody can make one up and it because it is supposed to be secret. A good example is the word tank. Today everybody knows that a tank is a vehicle with a turret on it, a cannon, but when the first tanks were built, they didn't want people to know that they are building weapons, so they said that they are building water tanks.

His father was Dewan Ali Raja, the grandson of Birendraram Singhdev (later converted from Hinduism to Islam and renamed as Dewan Raja Babu Khan).Hason Raja's mother was Hurmat Jahan Bibi, the last and fifth wife of Dewan Ali Raja Chowdhury of Kauriya. Hurmat was previously a widow after the death of her former husband, Muhammad Asim Chowdhury. Hason Raja spent most of his childhood in Lakshmansree with his mother as his father married widow of his first cousin late Amir Baksh Chowdhury who was living at Lahshmansree (Sunamganj) the most north-eastern part of now Bangladesh. His father started on and off living in Lakshmanshree of Sunamganj, 33 miles away from Rampasha, for at least three or four months of the year. Ali supervised and managed his wife's properties at Lakshmansree. That is why Lakshmansree was his birthplace of the poet. The death of Raja's elder half-brother, Ubaidur Raja, followed by the death of his father (in about 40 days gap), put the power and responsibility of the whole family upon Hason Raja at a very young age. Raja established schools and religious centres like mosques and he is said to have been widely engaged in charities within his immediate communities. He donated vast land properties for the well-being of the people. He was interested in the well-being and protection of birds and animal life. He spent a large quantity of his money on those lives. The 12 June 1897 Assam earthquake was one of the biggest earthquakes that occurred in the Assam and Sylhet area. The largest known Indian interpolate earthquake (at 8.0 on the moment magnitude scale) resulted in the destruction of structures over much of the Plateau and surrounding areas, and caused widespread liquefaction and flooding in the Brahmaputra and Sylhet floodplains. He found out many of his kin and relatives as well as his people wounded and killed. His thatched house was fully damaged. He lost many of his tamed birds and animals. Raja died on 6 December 1922.Two museums were established in his name in two places. One,Hason Raja Museumsponsored by ""Hason Raja Museum Trust"" at Sunamganjat his birthplace, Lokkonshri, Sunamganj, and another,Museum of Rajas'at RajaKunjo, Sylhet, sponsored by ""Educationist Dewan Talibur Raja Trust"".

It contained 500 poems and songs. AuthorHumayun Ahmedbrought Hason Raja's work in limelight again in modern days after using Raja's various popular folk songs in his movies and television dramas. Author Rabindranath Tagore quoted on Hason Raja, 'We realise it through admiration and love, through hope that soars beyond the actual, beyond our own span of life into an endless time wherein we live of all men.' and 'It is a village poet of East Bengal who preaches in a song the philosophical doctrine that the universe has its reality in its relation to the Person.' Sources vary regarding the month and day of his death.Banglapedia(Second edition) says he died in November.

"Papaya is a tall herbaceous plant in the genus Carica; its edible fruit is also called papaya. It is native to the tropical region of America, mainly from southern Mexico to Central America. Now these plants are grown in all tropical regions of the world. Papayas are plants of tropical regions and, for growth and fruit production, they need a warm climate. They cannot live with low temperatures. The genus Carica was given that name by Linnaeus because the leaves of these plants are like those of the common fig (Ficus carica). The common name comes from the Taíno word papáia that was changed in Spanish to papaya, the word most used worldwide, with some changes. In Australia and some countries of the Caribbean, the fruit is called papaw or pawpaw but another North American plant, Asimina triloba of the Annonaceae family has also that name. The French name for the fruit is papaye and papayer for the plant. In Portuguese, the fruit is called mamão, papaia or ababaia and the tree mamoeiro or papaeira. In Spanish, there are other names besides papaya. In Cuba, it is called fruta bomba except in the eastern provinces where papaya is used. In the Dominican Republic, Los Llanos (Venezuela) and Eastern Central Colombia, the name is lechosa. In Argentina and Paraguay, the fruit is called mamón. Other names and translations can be seen at Wiktionary. It is a large plant, like a tree, without branches; it is a herbaceous plant because the stem does not have much wood and remains soft and green until its death. The single stem grows from 5 to 10 m tall with all the leaves on the top. The leaves are large, 50–70cm wide. Some plants have perfect (with female and male organs) flowers but other plants have flowers with only one sex (female or male). Generally, the fruit is oval to nearly round and, in some cases, like a big pear. Fruits are 15-50 cm long and 10–20cm wide, and weigh up to 9 kg. The skin of the fruit is thin and tough; it is not eaten because is too bitter. First, the skin is green but it changes to yellow in ripe fruits, ready to be eaten. In a ripe fruit, the pulp is yellow, orange, pink, and even light red. Inside the fruit, there are many small black seeds. Papaya leaf Papayas tree and fruit, from Koehler's Medicinal-Plants (1887) Ripe papayas are eaten fresh, after taking out the skin and the seeds; sometimes, they are cut in small pieces and mixed with other fruits for a fruit salad. Papayas that are not completely ripe can be cut in pieces and cooked with sugar and eaten as dessert. In tropical regions, it is very popular to take papaya juice, after taking the skin and seeds out; this juice can be mixed with milk to make smoothies. Green papayas, those that are not ripe, are eaten in some Asiatic countries in salads, curries and soups but they should be boiled before eating them. Young leaves and stems are also cooked as a vegetable. Green papaya is used in Thai cuisine, both raw and cooked. The papaya is a source of iron and calcium; a good source of vitamins A, B and Riboflavin and an excellent source of vitamin C (ascorbic acid). The latex (a sap like milk) from the green fruits, the leaves and the stem are rich in papain, an enzyme that breaks down tough meat fibers. Papain is a component in products (meat tenderizers) sold in shops and that is used to make meat softer before cooking it. Papaya seeds have a peppery taste and are a great substitute for black peppercorns.",Easy

"French (Français) is a language spoken in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and several countries of Northern Africa (Tunisia, Gabon, etc.) and Western Africa (for example, Uganda), in the Caribbean (places like Martinique) and elsewhere. It is also the official language of the Canadian province of Quebec and one of the official languages of New Brunswick. French is a Latin language like Spanish and Italian. French uses the Latin alphabet just as English does, with the addition of several accent marks that are not used in English: the acute accent or accent aigu (é), the grave accent or accent grave (è), and the circumflex accent or accent circonflexe (ê). There is also a diacritical mark called a cedilla or cédille, which is placed under the letter c (ç) to give it a soft pronunciation (like an ""s"" sound) in certain situations where it would otherwise be pronounced hard (like a ""k""). There are 110 million people who can speak French natively. But there are 300 million French speakers total, which means that 190 million people decided to learn the language as adults! This is because there is a lot of interesting literature in French. French is also a language often used in diplomacy. French was first spoken in France. Four of France's neighbors — Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Monaco — also use French as one of their official languages. And because of colonization, French is spoken in Canada (the majority in Québec), Louisiana, some countries in Africa, and other places around the world. French evolved from the Latin language, just like Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian. In the 1600s, French people came to Canada and settled in the area we now call Québec. Some French people (who were expelled from Canada) also settled in Louisiana, which was named in honor of King Louis XIV of France. Louisiana is now a state of the United States. In the 1800s, France conquered large parts of northern, western, and central Africa. As France took over ruling these territories and their populations, they established French as the language of instruction in schools, and as the official language of the government. Over time, French became the second native language of many African people, although local languages are still used most often in the home. Although France no longer rules these former colonies, they still use French in daily life. Some famous authors or poets in this language are: This song can be sung as a 'round', which is when one person or group starts the song, and when they arrive at the end of the first verse, the second person or group begins.",Easy

"Physics, a branch of science, is the study of all forces and their impacts on the environment. Modern physics connects ideas together about the four laws of symmetry and conservation (energy, momentum, charge, and parity). The word physics comes from the Greek word ἡ φύσις ""nature"". Physics is the study of energy and matter in space and time and how they are related to each other. Physicists assume the existence of mass, length, time and electric current and then define (give the meaning of) all other physical quantities in terms of these basic units. Mass, length, time, and electric current are never defined but the standard units used to measure them are always defined. In the International System of Units (abbreviated SI from the French Système International), the kilogram is the basic unit of mass, the metre is the basic unit of length, the second is the basic unit of time, and the ampere is the basic unit of electric current. In addition to these four units, there are three other ones: the mole, which is the unit of the quantity of matter, the candela which measures the luminous intensity (the power of lighting) and the kelvin, the unit of temperature. Physics studies how things move, and the forces that make them move. For example, velocity and acceleration are used by physics to show how things move. Also, physicists study the forces of gravity, electricity, magnetism and the forces that hold things together. Physics studies very large things, and very small things. For instance, physicists can study stars, planets and galaxies but could also study small pieces of matter, such as atoms and electrons.They may also study sound, light and other waves. As well as that, they could examine energy, heat and radioactivity, and even space and time. Physics not only helps people understand how objects move, but how they change form, how they make noise, how hot or cold they will be, and what they are made of at the smallest level.",Easy
"The Pawnee are a Native American tribe. They lived mainly in what is now Nebraska and Kansas. Unlike other tribes of the Great Plains, they were a semi-nomadic (meaning they did not live in one place) people. They were hunters and farmers. The Pawnee farmed for most of the year and lived in earth lodges. During the buffalo hunting season, they lived in tepees so they could follow the herds. In the early 1800s their main village was on the south side of the Platte River (in Nebraska). They raised crops including beans, corn, pumpkins, squash and sunflowers. The powerful Pawnee tribe had four individual bands. These were the Chaui (or Grand), the Kitkehaki (Republican Pawnees), Pitahauerat (Tapage Pawnees) and the Skidi (Loup or Wolf Pawnees). They were a fierce people who used war paint and tattoos to frighten their enemies. The Pawnee took scalps in battle. Pawnee war parties often rode out on scalping missions against other tribes. The Pawnee also practiced human sacrifice. Most often this took the form of ritually killing a young captive girl in a five-day ceremony. She was sacrificed to the Morning Star (deity). The last known ritual killing was of a girl in the mid-18th century. The Pawnee were the largest tribe to have lived in Nebraska. They were one of the earliest tribes to come to the area. Estimates are that there were between 10,000 and 12,000 Pawnee in Nebraska by 1800. They had little to fear from their enemies because they were a large tribe.

"The Sumerians lived in Mesopotamia around 4000 BC. Mesopotamia or ""the Fertile Crescent"" was a region in the Middle East between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, in the territory of modern Iraq, Iran and Syria. Ancient Sumeria was very small: it occupied only a narrow stretch of this territory, where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers reach the Persian Gulf. Their territory was mostly inside the modern-day borders of Iraq, with small stretches of land in Kuwait, Iran and Arabia. Sumerian traders are known to have sailed down the Gulf as far as modern-day Qatar and Bahrain, and to have traveled upstream to Haran, in the neighborhood of the modern-day cities of Mosul and Tikirit. Since the land between these two rivers was very fertile, people first started practising agriculture (farming), there. Sumer became home to the first civilizations and cities. In the beginning these cities were independent, each city being a state or nation of its own. Each city had its own king, laws, gods, and calendar. The biggest cities were Eridu, Kish, Lagash, Uruk, Ur, and Nippur. The rulers of these cities led constant wars The Sumerians built houses, palaces and temples using mud bricks. Good stone is not found in the Euphrates delta, so it had to be transported at great expense over long distances. Small quantities of precious stone would be used to cover the brick in places, but most Sumerian buildings were brick. Sumerians made bricks by scooping wet mud into a wooden frame. The bricks would be all of the same size, but slightly rounded on top. The Sumerians preferred low, wide bricks to the standard shape we use today. Sunshine would evaporate most of the water from the brick, which hardened. Builders only rarely fired their bricks to make them totally hard. This meant that heavy rains and floods would usually destroy Sumerian buildings. Fired bricks would be decorated with paints or glazes, and assembled to form pictures on walls. Sometimes the Sumerians covered walls of brick with an added layer of mud, into which they would push cones of colored clay to decorate walls. The most famous type of Sumerian architecture was the Ziggurat. Ziggurats were many-storied structures like pyramids, or wedding cakes. Each layer was square, with a smaller layer built on top. Stairs on the outside of the ziggurat led up the sides to the top of the building. This put the top platform of the ziggurat high in the air. There the Sumerian priests put temples to their gods. It is possible they also watched the movements of the stars from observatories there, built very high on a platform of mud brick. On these large platforms were built smaller and smaller platforms, creating a pyramid shape. Originally they were made out of mud brick but Ziggurats from later times were made out of fired bricks, which were glazed and adorned with pictures or faced with stone carvings. Most people's houses did not look like this. They were simple mud brick huts, similar to those found all over the Middle and Near East. Many of them had courtyards at the center, with chambers for eating and working on the main floor, and rooms for sleeping either at the back or upstairs. We do not know what the roofs of these houses were like, but we can guess. They were built of heavy sticks set into the wall in one direction, and lighter sticks laid over them in another direction, and covered with a layer of mud. As Sumerians were mostly agricultural people, they ate what they farmed: wheat, barley, lentils, beans, garlic, onions, milk and milk products. They made bread and beer from grains. Meat, usually from goats or sheep and occasionally cattle, was probably rare in their diets; the animals were too expensive to kill. They ate apples and other kinds of foods. Records of ancient Sumerian laws show that oxen — cattle bred, de-horned and neutered for work — were valuable but potentially dangerous animals. When they escaped, they did damage to fields and sometimes injured or killed people. Sheep and goats were probably more common. The wool and leather from the animals was also useful, because it could be turned into clothing or armor or tools. Their clothing was mostly made out of wool and flax. flax is a plant with blue flowers. the stem of flax was used in making the clothing. clothing was also made out of other products they could grow themselves. The men of Sumer often had long hair with a parting in the middle. Many had long beards as well, although some men preferred to be clean-shaven. The mens attire consisted of long skirts and no shirts. woman wore floor-length gowns that covered the left shoulder. The right shoulder and arm were left bare. Sumerian women also wore their hair long. Most women would braid their locks into one long braid which they then wrapped around the top of their heads. when there were guests around women would wear a headdress. princesses wore bright colored clothes and expensive jewelry made out of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and carnelian. heavier clothing was worn in the winter and lighter clothing was worn in the summer. social status was determined by the quantity and quality of jewelry and clothing a person owned but they did not need a lot of clothing because of where they lived (in a warm, dry climate). Sumerians were the first to invent writing. They wrote with sharpened sticks made of reed – a plant that grows on the banks of rivers. One of these sticks is called a stylus. When you push this kind of pen into a tablet of raw clay, you’ll get lines that look like wedges: thicker on one side, thinner on the other. That is why their writing is called Cuneiform, which means ""wedge-shaped"". Writing consisted of small pictures. At first, these pictures were drawn into the clay with the stylus. There was a different picture for each word. That meant that a person had to know thousands of these pictures to read and write. Only very educated people, called scribes, were able to read and write. The scribes found drawing pictures to be very hard even in smooth wet clay, so they invented standard ways to combine wedges to form the pictures. After many centuries, they created very quick combinations of wedges that formed the pictures. Children went to schools to learn how to be scribes. They began by reciting prayers to their gods and promises to their teachers to study hard and learn well. Then they learned to shape clay into many kinds of tablets — rounded squares for legal contracts, and large oblongs for poetry, and cylinders or prisms for royal decrees. They also copied out word lists — rows of symbols that belonged to specific categories, like the names of kings, and the words for different kinds of jobs, and words for different products available in the markets of the city. The teachers used sticks to beat slow learners, but also gave special tutoring to the students of parents who paid extra. After learning many words, scribes practised making whole documents by copying out famous laws, poems and songs. This made them fast and accurate scribes. Scribes wrote numbers with the back end of the stylus, and used different symbols for 1, 5, 10, 20, and 60. So the number ""157"" would be written with two 60s, a 20, a 10, a 5 and two 1s (60+60= 120 + 20 = 140 + 10 = 150 + 5 = 155 + 1 +1 = 157). Scribes could add and subtract. Some seem to have known how to multiply and divide, but most did not. Highly trained scribes appear to have known some geometry and some astronomy, but the Sumerians did not have an accurate calendar. Sumerians had many gods. An was the god of the sky, Enki the god of water, Enlil the god of air, Ki the goddess of the earth, Inanna the goddess of fertility and many more. Plus, they had lots of local deities; each town had its own. The sky god An was very important, but not always very smart. In one story, he decided to destroy all humans one day, because their noise was tremendous and it kept him awake. An ordered Enki to send a flood to destroy everyone, and Enki did so. But An had forgotten that people give the gods sacrifices of food, drink, and incense. Because of this, the gods nearly starved because An was upset about a little noise. Fortunately, a Sumerian named Utnapishtim had gotten warning of the flood from Enlil, the god of air. Enlil told Utnapishtim to build a boat, and sail away on the flood with useful plants and animals in the boat. The old Sumerian man had done so, and when the flood waters receded, he sacrificed to the gods. The food revived An and the others, and they recognized their folly at last. Never again, they promised, would they try to wipe out humans. A version of this story is recorded in the Hebrew Bible, which is repeated in the Christian Bible. The Sumerians began as a series of powerful city-states. Each city had its own god and looked after itself and ruled the surrounding countryside. They fought each other as well as made alliances. This culture lasted from about 2900 - 2400 BC. They had a very distinct culture and their style of architecture, writing and religion spread throughout the Middle East. The Akkadians settled North of Sumer along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and copied many of the Sumerians' ideas. Later on, one of the Akkadian kings, Sargon I conquered all the city states of Sumer and Akkad and created the world's first empire. His reign lasted about 60 years (2371 - 2316 BC) and his empire stretched from the coast of Lebanon to Iran. When Sargon died, his empire broke up and the Sumerians and Akkadians were invaded by other groups of tribesmen from the mountains. After this, the dominant forces in the Middle East were the Babylonians and Assyrians. These two civilizations were descendents of the Akkadians who had ruled over the whole area, but they split into separate empires. The Assyrians were in the North and the Babylonians were in the South. The Sumerians as a people no longer existed, though their writing, architecture and religion influenced the civilizations in this area for centuries after. They had over 100 gods. The most famous of Sumerians is Gilgamesh, legendary king of Uruk. He is known due to the Epic of Gilgamesh, a collection of Sumerian legends, later translated and written down in Akkadian. It tells about the adventure of Gilgamesh, his friendship with Enkidu, a wild man raised by animals, and his journey to obtain the secret of immortality. In the Epic, Gilgamesh is portrayed as a young king full of arrogance and pride. Gilgamesh is a bully, and has no friends. The gods are worried because Gilgamesh is so unkind to his people, so they send Enkidu, a wild man every bit Gilgamesh's equal, to be his friend. When they meet each other, Gilgamesh starts a fight, but he discovers that Enkidu is so strong that he cannot win; but Enkidu discovers the same thing about Gilgamesh. As soon as they have tired each other out, without one or the other winning, they become fast friends. Enkidu teaches Gilgamesh kindness, while Gilgamesh teaches Enkidu to be civilized. Both grow up to be very handsome. Gilgamesh decides he needs a tree for the roof of his palace, so he proposes a quest to the cedar forest to cut down a tree. Enkidu is horrified and warns Gilgamesh of the terrifying monster Humbaba who guards the forest. Gilgamesh manages to persuade his friend to go anyway, and they go on the quest in search of the tree. Together they meet and kill the monster, and chop down the tree. But the death of Humbaba makes the gods angry. Further, the goddess Inanna sees Gilgamesh and wants him for her husband. But Gilgamesh tells her that she has already had too many husbands, and she has used them all up — she even kills them when she tires of them! Gilgamesh prefers being a bachelor, thank you. Angered, Inanna persuades her father to release the Bull of Heaven in Uruk, to destroy Gilgamesh and his people. The Bull runs wild in the streets, for to touch it is death. Many are slain by the touch of the Bull, its horns or its flanks or its tail. Enkidu and Gilgamesh go out to destroy the Bull, and they succeed in killing it. But the Bull manages to touch Enkidu, who sickens and dies. Gilgamesh is heartbroken, and refuses to let anyone care for the body or bury his friend. He delays so long that maggots begin falling out of Enkidu's eye sockets and nostrils. Finally, Gilgamesh consents to the burial of his friend, but he cannot bear the thought of dying himself. His mother tries to console him and tell him that death is normal, but the king of Uruk will not hear it. He resolves to go to the ends of the earth in search of a cure for dying — a way to become immortal. He faces many perils on his trip. First he travels through the tunnel that the Sun uses when traveling underneath the earth. He enters it at sunrise, and races to the other end, hoping to get out before the hot sun comes in at sunset, and burns him alive. He makes it, but then he must confront the scorpion monster. However, the scorpion monster's wife tells her husband to leave the human alone, he is so tired. The scorpion monster allows Gilgamesh to live, and guides him to Sudri, a woman who keeps a tavern for the gods at the end of the earth. Sudri refuses to give Gilgamesh the secret of eternal life, but the boatman offers to guide Gilgamesh to Utnapishtim, who lives forever. Together, Gilgamesh and the boatman cross the Waters of Death, though not without some trouble. The next chapters of this epic form the story of Utnapishtim, the king who saved humankind of the Great Flood. His tale is very similar to the Biblical story of Noah's Ark. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh that he cannot handle living forever, because he cannot even stay awake seven days. Despite his weariness, Gilgamesh agrees to stay awake for seven days. Mrs. Utnapishtim promises to bring Gilgamesh a loaf of bread every day so that he can eat. No sooner than she goes away to prepare the loaf for the first day, but Gilgamesh falls asleep! He sleeps all through all seven days. When he wakes, he insists to Utnapishtim that he only dozed a moment — but the seven stale and moldy loaves of bread beside him prove otherwise. Utnapishtim denies Gilgamesh the secret, and takes him back to the boatman. The boatman is sympathetic to Gilgamesh, though, and tells the king of Uruk that Utnapishtim gets his eternal life from a plant under the water. If Gilgamesh only dives into the water and brings up the plant, he will have eternal life. Gilgamesh, now thinking of home, decides to get the plant and bring it home to his royal gardens in Uruk. There, it will make everyone immortal, and the whole city will thank him. He dives into the water, retrieves the plant, and returns across the water. There, while he sleeps, a snake comes along and devours the plant. Not until he is within sight of the walls of his home city, Uruk, does Gilgamesh realize that his journey was for nothing. He weeps, but consoles himself with the knowledge that he has built a strong city which will endure long after he is dead and gone. Though Sumerians do not exist anymore, they left many technological inventions, like the wheel (which made transport easier and quicker), the potter’s wheel, baked clay, the cuneiform script, and lots of agricultural inventions: irrigation systems, agricultural tools and even beer-brewing. They may have been the first people to fit sails to boats. They made astronomical observations, and were also the first to measure time in 60-minute hours and 60-second minutes. Their priests invented clocks too, some were just like kinds of sundials and others were a type of water clock, with water dripping slowly from a pottery jar. The peasants in Sumeria were the first ones to find out how to harness animals to plows, instead of cultivating the land with hand hoes, and this allowed people to grow much more grain. Recent collaboration between archeologists and DNA analysts tell that there is a strong connection between the marsh Arabs of Iraq and Iran and the Sumerian culture.",Easy
"Donald Duck is a fictional cartoon and comic book character created by Walt Disney in 1934. He is known and loved around the world. Donald made his first appearance in 1934 in the Silly Symphony cartoon, The Wise Little Hen. Donald was voiced by Clarence Nash. The cartoon was adapted to a newspaper comic strip which was published the same year. Donald is a white barnyard duck who usually wears a sailor suit and cap. He is known—in both cartoons and comics—for his explosive temper. His greatest sources of frustration are two mischievous chipmunks named Chip and Dale. These two rob his pantry and nest in his roof. Donald's temper usually backfires, leaving him either injured, humiliated, or embarrassed. Donald's universe was greatly expanded when Carl Barks began writing and drawing the Donald Duck comic books and stories in the 1940s. The first Barks-drawn comic book was 'Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold in 1942. Barks' creations include Donald's Uncle Scrooge McDuck, a stingy, grumpy billionaire, Gyro Gearloose, an absent-minded amateur inventor, and Gladstone Gander, a suave, well-dressed gander afflicted with eternal good luck. Donald lives in Duckberg, Calisota, with his three little nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie. His girlfriend is Daisy Duck. His comic book stories are either domestic comedies set at home in Duckberg or treasure hunts to exotic lands led by Uncle Scrooge.",Easy

"Mary Poppins is a 1964 live-actionanimated musical movie produced by Walt Disney and directed by Robert Stevenson. The movie was filmed entirely in the Disney Studios in Burbank, California. The movie was based on the Mary Poppins children's books by P. L. Travers. In the books, Poppins is a strict and pompous character, but in the movie she is transformed into a gentle and kindly character. The movie setting was changed from the 1930s of the books to the Edwardian era. Travers objected to the ""toning-down"" of the harsher aspects of the Mary Poppins character. She also objected to the songs, and any suggestion of a romance between Mary and Bert. She so hated the animated sequences that she ruled out any further adaptations of the Mary Poppins books. Disney was unsuccessful in trying to persuade her otherwise. Travers was not invited to the premiere, but asked Disney for permission to attend. At the premiere, she marched up to Disney and told him the animated sequences had to ""go"". Disney had the last word on the product, and said as he walked away, ""Pamela, the ship has sailed."" When a musical was being planned many years later, Travers refused to grant her permission for the adaptation should anyone associated with the movie be involved. The movie is about an eccentric and magical English nanny, her chimney sweep friend Bert, and two young children estranged from their busy father, a banker, and their mother, a suffragette. Poppins has the job of bringing the dysfunctional family together before she sails away on the wind. The movie stars Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins, Dick Van Dyke as her friend chimney sweep friend Bert, David Tomlinson as Mr. Banks, Glynis Johns as Mrs. Banks, and Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber as the children Jane and Michael Banks. The songs were written by the Sherman brothers, Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman. These songs include ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"", ""A Spoonful of Sugar"", ""Jolly Holiday"", ""Step in Time"", ""Feed the Birds"", and ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"", which won the Best Song Academy Award. The movie was nominated for thirteen Academy Awards and won five. Andrews won the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance. The movie received universal critical praise. Dick Van Dyke though was roundly takedn to task for his inauthentic Cockney accent. The movie inspired a 2004 award-winning musical, and the 2013 movie Saving Mr. Banks starring Tom Hanks as Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as P. L. Travers. In 2013, Mary Poppins was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".",Easy

"A flush toilet is a toilet that relies on a flush of water to send waste products away through a drainpipe. It is sometimes called a water closet, or WC, loo, head, the porcelain throne, etc. A toilet works because of gravity. When a flush lever is pulled, a plug will open, allowing water to flow out to fill the basin. Then the gravity causes the liquid to flow out of the basin through a bend in the pipe, called an S trap. The flush cleans the bowl of the toilet, and under the rim where it is difficult to reach. It carries waste matter to a drain, which then takes it to a treatment plant or septic tank. The handlebutton, is pressed to flush the toilet. The water used for flushing is stored in the tank (also called a cistern). Some flush toilets operate electronically. When the user moves away, the toilet flushes. The tank contains some important parts. The inlet valve controls the water supply coming into the tank. It lets water in when the tank is empty, and stops water coming in when the tank is full. The ""'float ball""' rises as the tank fills with water. As it rises, the float rod attached to it presses against the inlet valve. When the tank is full, the rod is pressing against the inlet valve hard enough to turn the water off. This stops the tank from overflowing. When you press the handle, a lever inside the tank pulls the piston up, forcing some water through the siphon. This provides suction in the siphon, and the rest of the water follows, emptying the tank. The tank empties quite quickly, and the float ball floats to the bottom. That means the float rod is no longer pressing against the valve, so water begins to flow into the tank, filling it up again. The water which left the tank goes through a short pipe to the toilet bowl. It sloshes around the rim, down the sides of the bowl, and out through the drainpipe, cleaning the bowl and carrying the waste with it. Some of the clean water coming behind remains at the bottom of the toilet bowl. That's because modern toilets have an 'S' bend which remains filled with water between flushing. The water in the 'S' bend stops bad odours escaping from the drainpipe. During flushing the 'S' bend also provides siphon action which helps speed up the flushing process. However, since this type of toilet does not generally handle waste on site, separate waste treatment systems must be built. The toilet has made homes, towns and cities cleaner places to live in. Because water cleans the toilets very well, highly contagious diseases cannot spread as easily as in the past. However, some toilet flushing can produce very small droplets of water known as aerosols. These aerosols can contain bacteria and viruses that are in the toilet. Because the aerosols float through the air, there is a risk of becoming infected. This has been believed to be a cause for outbreak of atypical pneumonia within several high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong that are close to each other. Different toilets use different amounts of water per flush, depending on the country or the period. Older models in some countries use 13 or even 19 liters per flush while newer models use 6 liters per flush. Today, some well-designed 6 liter toilets flush better than lesser toilets that use 2-3 times more water per flush. The design of the surfaces that control the flow of water make a big difference. Some toilets have extra fixtures such as grab-bars for wheelchair users. Some toilets have a water jet built into them like a bidet. Some have heated seats, and lids that open and close automatically. And some will even check your blood pressure and temperature. Toilets come in many different types. There are chemical toilets, which use chemicals to neutralize the waste instead of water. There are composting toilets, which do not use water and turn the waste into natural compost. There are even incinerating toilets, which burn the waste. The flush toilet were first used in parts of India and Pakistan about 2,700 years ago. The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewage system. Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece. There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bath houses where men and women were together in mixed company. Toilets are usually connected to a septic tank, or to a sewer. In 1775 Alexander Cummings invented the S-trap, which is still used today, that used standing water to seal the outlet of the bowl, preventing the escape of foul air from the sewer. His design had a sliding valve in the bowl outlet above the trap. Some ideas and inventions had to be developed before it could be created: To have a flush toilet in one's house, first of all one has to have fresh and clean water supply. A better organization of the cities was needed for that. The lever and the siphon also had to be invented before the flush toilet could have come into being. WC helps public health of today to keep higher standards than in the past. That allows us today to live in much bigger cities than in the past, not being afraid of getting sick: beyond a certain population cities and villages would be at risk of epidemics before toilets were widespread. Big cities were a requirement to start the industrial revolution in the 1800s. Although WC seems to be an invention of minor importance, its impact to our modern world was quite great. The toilet has also created a whole new profession like plumber and his associated industry.",Easy

"Sri Lanka (Sinhalese: ශ්‍රී ලංකාව, śrī laṃkāva, Tamil: இலங்கை, ilaṅkai), is a third world country located in the Indian Ocean, south of the country of India. It used to be known as Ceylon until 1972. The small country (about the size of Alabama) earned its independence officially on February 4, 1948. Sri Lanka is a country with a deep history and rich culture. Sri Lanka, currently and for centuries, has been a known island for tourism and the rich culture today. Sri Lanka, today, is a republic and a unitary state governed by a presidential system. The country's capital is Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, near the biggest city (which is wrongly claimed as the capital of Sri Lanka), Colombo. Sri Lanka is an important producer of tea, coffee, gemstones, coconuts, rubber, and cinnamon. Sri Lanka's two nicknames are the ""Pearl of the Indian Ocean"" and ""The Nation of Smiling People"". Sri Lanka is also part of the United Nations. According to the Mahavamsa, a traditional date of ancient Sri Lanka is the landing of Vijaya, who arrived in Sri Lanka with 700 followers with him and ruled Sri Lanka from 543 BC – 505 BC (Modern time now: 38 years!). Vijaya played an important role in Sri Lanka, such as the establishment of the Kingdom of Tambapanni. Vijaya played an important role in the country's ancient history. Another annual date of ancient Sri Lanka is the arrival of Buddhism from Devanampiya Tissa of Sri Lanka. Epigraphic sources show the appearance of Buddhism around the 3rd century B.C. The entire ancient period of ancient Sri Lanka is dominated by the Anuradhapura Kingdom, which includes Sri Lanka's ancient history in one place. The Sri Lanka Kingdom moved into Anuradhapura in 380 B.C., from there onwards, the city of Anuradhapura stayed as the capital of Sri Lanka for more than 1000 years, until the fall of the kingdom in 1017 A.D., when Rajendra I sent a large invasion on the kingdom. Thus, the capital then moved to Polonnaruwa. After more than a century under Chola control, Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa successfully drove off the Chola Empire, thus, reuniting the country back together once again. Also, reuniting the country back in Buddhism culture too when Vijayabahu I, in request, sent monks from Burma to Sri Lanka. The next centuries consist of Tamil rulers fighting over the island, which resulted in the north section ruled by Tamils, primarily Hindus, and the south section controlled by the Sinhalese, primarily Buddhists. Colonial Powers finally achieved power over Sri Lanka in 1505, when the Portuguese took possession in the county until the Dutch India Company took control in 1658 until 1796 when the British took over the country, Sri Lanka became an English Colony officially in 1802. The British (which means Sri Lanka did too) developed Coffee, Tea, and Rubber. Finally, in 1948, (after uniting the Tamils and Sinhalese) Ceylonese rulers finally gained independence from the British. Sri Lanka became part of the Commonwealth of Nations. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike became Sri Lanka's prime minister in 1956, resulting in championship of Sinhalese Nationality (resulting in minorities of Tamil civilians, in result, the Tamil Tigers are founded) and full support of Buddhism. S.W. was assassinated by a monk in 1959. Left is his widow, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who became the world's first female Prime Minister. The name Ceylon turned into Sri Lanka in May 22, 1972. The first president of Sri Lanka is William Gopallawa. Sri Lanka is known as a Tropical Country, so that would mean that the climate is usually wet from rain, or Monsoons, which are periods of rain over a certain amount of time, India's monsoons travel down to Sri Lanka, so you would expect much rain. Other than rain, the temperatures at Sri Lanka are hot - extremely hot all year long, that is why residents at Sri Lanka where ""man skirts"", or sarongs, to keep cool. Otherwise, Sri Lanka climate is somewhat the same as India's, Bangladesh's, and Pakistan's. The Sri Lankan Culture is very interesting, from the foods to the religion. But, the culture did, in-fact, dramatically changed when the British lost possession of the country, which means that there are no Sri Lankans with baskets on there heads walking on the streets working for the British government, as what the country was going through, even though the culture totally changed, it has yet, maintained most of there more earlier traditions. They still do work for the British somewhat, with clothing, and the production of rubber. Yet, Sri Lanka has also been maintaining ancient aspects too, such as the arrival of Buddhism. Due to the island's history of immigrants and Indian rulers, the island's culture is somewhat widespread, and mixed in with Indian Culture also. Well, Sri Lanka is best known for a couple of traditions they have, one of them is the main sport of the country, cricket, which has been a sport there for a quite a long time. The traditional music and food are also pretty ""main"" in the culture as well.

He was born at Lugdunum in Gaul, the first Roman Emperor to be born outside Italy. Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, his family did not want him. He was excluded from public office until his consulship, shared with his nephew Caligula in 37. Claudius' infirmity probably saved him from the fate of many other nobles during the purges of Tiberius and Caligula's reigns. Potential enemies did not see him as a serious threat. He was declared Emperor by the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's assassination. He was then the last man of his family. Despite his lack of experience, Claudius was an able and efficient administrator. He was also an ambitious builder, constructing many new roads, aqueducts, and canals across the Roman Empire. During his reign the Empire began the conquest of Britain (if the earlier invasions of Britain by Caesar are not counted). Having an interest in law, he presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day. He was seen as vulnerable throughout his reign, especially by men of the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to maintain his position. This resulted in the deaths of many senators. Many writers say that he was murdered by his own wife.

"Vatican City is an independent state that is located inside Rome, Italy. It came into existence only in 1929. It is clearly distinct from the central authority of the Roman Catholic Church, known as the Holy See, which existed long before 1929. Vatican City is ruled by the Pope and he represents all of the world's Roman Catholics. Vatican City is the smallest country in the world, with an area of 44 hectares (110 acres, about half a square kilometre). Vatican City has its own constitution, postal system, seal, flag, and other symbols of statehood. The Vatican City uses the Euro (but it isn't part of the European Union) as its currency and produces special Vatican Euro coins which are very valuable because of their rarity. During the Middle Ages, the Papacy, where the pope resided, controlled much of central Italy, (known commutatively as the Papal States). However, soon pressure from outside and the reunification of Italy made it so the Papacy lost all of its land except the Holy See. During World War II Vatican City was officially neutral even though it is located inside Italy which was part of the Axis powers. The Vatican City pressured both sides in the war to make sure that Rome (and Vatican City) was never bombed from the air. The present Pope is Francis who has been Pope since 2013. Because of its minute size, the Vatican City has a climate and geography similar to that of Rome. Vatican City has a temperate, Mediterranean climate with mild, rainy winters from September to mid-May and hot, dry summers from May to August. The main areas accessible to the public are St. Peter's Square, a large open square bordering Italy; St. Peter's Basilica (the principal church of the Catholic church) and other buildings including the Vatican Museum and the Sistine Chapel. Vatican City's population is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population. Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications. Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies. All citizens of Vatican City are Catholic. The only people allowed to live in the Vatican City are clergy (religious people) and the Swiss Guards who are the Police force of the country. Over 2,400 other people work in the country but they travel in each day from Italy. The Vatican City is itself of great cultural significance. Buildings such as St. Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel are home to some of the most famous art in the world, which includes works of art by artists such as Botticelli, Bernini, Raphael and Michelangelo.

"The scientific name is how species of any living organism are named by biologists. Is follows the binomial nomenclature, that is to say the name of a species is made of two parts: one indicating the genus and one indicating the species. Binomial nomenclature means ""two-part name"" or ""system of two-part names"". It is made of Latin words or at least Latinized words that are not real Latin and may come from another language. The person who popularized this system for use was Swedish botanist and physician Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778) who tried to name all things in the natural world and gave every species (animal, vegetable or mineral) that he knew a two-part name. This kind of naming had been used before Linnaeus, but before Linnaeus, almost nobody used binomial nomenclature. After Linnaeus, about everybody did. The value of the binomial nomenclature comes from its economy, its widespread use, and the uniqueness and stability of names in the system. The system replaced the use of Latin descriptive names, which were not handy as they were long (and growing all the time). An important reason for the stability of names is that they need not be descriptive. For example, Simmondsia chinensis has the component chinensis which means ""from China""; this was used in error, as the species is from California. Nevertheless, this name is used worldwide and is not to be 'corrected'. In today's system of naming, a name is just a label, and remains stable even if it is misdescriptive. Of course, ideally names should be descriptive; this makes it easier to remember them: Populus alba has leaves which are white underneath (alba means ""white""). The components of a name may come from any source whatsoever. Often they are Latin words, but they may also come from Ancient Greek, from a place, from a person, a name from a local language, etc. The names themselves are always treated grammatically as if they were a Latin sentence. This is why the name of a species is sometimes called its ""Latin name,"" but scientists like calling these names scientific names. The genus name must be unique inside each group of life. Species indicators need not be unique, but of course may not be used twice within the same genus.",Easy

Julie Uhrman founded the project in 2012, bringing in designer Yves Béhar to collaborate on its design and Muffi Ghadiali as VP of Product Management to put together the engineering team. Development was funded via Kickstarter, raising US$8.5 million, becoming one of the website's highest earning projects in its history. Units started to ship to Kickstarter backers in March 2013 and were released to the general public in June 2013. It features an exclusive Ouya store for applications and games designed specifically for the Ouya platform, of which the majority are casual games targeted at or used by a mass audience of casual gamers. Out of the box, Ouya supports media apps such as Twitch and the Kodi media center. It runs a modified version of Android Jelly Bean, with rooting being officially encouraged. The console's hardware design allows it to be easily opened up, requiring only a standard screwdriver for easy modding and possible hardware add-ons. All systems can be used as development kits, allowing any Ouya owner to also be a developer, without the need for licensing fees. All games were initially required to have some kind of free-to-play aspect, whether that be completely free, has a free trial, or has purchasable upgrades, levels, or other in-game items. This requirement was later removed. Despite the successful Kickstarter campaign, sales were lackluster, causing financial problems for Ouya Inc. and forcing the company to wind down the business. Its software assets were sold to Razer Inc., who announced the discontinuation of the console in July 2015. Razer continued to provide software support for existing Ouya units until June 2019, when it shut down Ouya storefront, services and accounts, making most apps on the console unusable.

"A conspiracy is when there is a lot of people who are working on something in secret and they don't tell anybody about. It can also be a lie that starts as just an idea or a rumour, in order to trick people into doing something. It is also called a conspiracy theory, because sometimes it is just an idea that is not true and that is very difficult to prove or disprove because if it was true then it is supposed to be a secret, which provides an excuse for the lack of proof. There have been many conspiracies in the history of the world and they are usually connected to people trying to take things from other people without the other people noticing until it is too late. There are a lot of conspiracy theories because anybody can make one up and it because it is supposed to be secret. A good example is the word tank. Today everybody knows that a tank is a vehicle with a turret on it, a cannon, but when the first tanks were built, they didn't want people to know that they are building weapons, so they said that they are building water tanks. Some things look like conspiracies, but can be explained by sociology, which studies how people behave in large numbers.",Easy
"The Brandenburg Gate (German: Brandenburger Tor) is a monument in Berlin, the capital of Germany. It was built by King Frederick William II of Prussia after the successful restoration of order in Bavaria. It is one of the most well-known landmarks in Germany and has become the symbol of the city of Berlin and the symbol of reunited Germany. It is named after the town of Brandenburg an der Havel, for the city gate marked the start from Berlin to that town. It is the last city gate still standing in Berlin. It is located at the Pariser Platz, north of the Reichtag building (the parliament building). It forms the entry to Unter den Linden, a famous street in Berlin. During the separation of Berlin in east and west after the Second World War, the Brandenburg Gate was located in het east but was seen from the west for it stood right beside the Berlin Wall. At that time, it was the symbol of divided Germany, divided Berlin and divided Europe. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the re-unity of Germany, it became the symbol of the reunited Berlin, Germany, and Europe. At that time, the gate had to undergo a big restoration.",Easy

"Medusa is a character in Greek mythology. After violating Athena's temple, she was changed into a monster with snakes for hair. Her offspring include Pegasus, the winged horse. Medusa has been depicted in art for centuries. Many interpretations surround the myth including one by Sigmund Freud. Medusa is one of three sisters known as The Gorgons. Medusa's sisters are Stheno and Euryale. They were all children of the marine deities Phorkys and his sister Keto. Medusa was mortal; her sisters were immortal. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, Medusa is said to have been very beautiful. She attracted the notice of Poseidon, the Sea God. The two had intimate relations in Temple of Athena. The goddess was outraged that her temple was used this way, and transformed Medusa into a monster with snakes for hair. Any man who looked upon her was turned to stone. Medusa was beheaded by the hero Perseus. After defeating his enemies with the head, he presented it to Athena. She put it on her shield, the Aegis. At the time of her death, Medusa was pregnant by Poseidon. When Perseus beheaded her, Pegasus, a winged horse, and Chrysaor, a golden sword-wielding giant, sprang from her body. Medusa was the subject for ancient vase painters, mosaicists, and sculptors. She appears on the breastplate of Alexander the Great in the Alexander Mosaic at the House of the Faun in Pompeii, Italy (about 200 BC). A Roman copy of Phidias' Medusa (left) is held in Munich, Germany. The work was later used as a model for the Gorgon's head in Antonio Canova's marble Perseus with the Head of Medusa (1798–1801). Renaissance depictions include the bronze sculpture Perseus with the Head of Medusa by Benvenuto Cellini (1554); the bronze statue Perseus and Medusa by Hubert Gerhard (1590); and the oil on canvas painting Medusa by Caravaggio (1597). Baroque depictions include Head of Medusa by Peter Paul Rubens (1618); the marble bust Medusa by Gianlorenzo Bernini (1630s); Perseus Turning Phineus and his Followers to Stone, an oil on canvas by Luca Giordano from the early 1680s. Romantic and modern depictions include Perseus with the Head of Medusa by Antonio Canova (1801); Medusa, a marble sculpture by Harriet Hosmer (1854), Medusa an oil painting by Arnold Böcklin (about 1878); Perseus, a bronze sculpture by Salvador Dalí. Medusa remained a common theme in art in the nineteenth century, when her myth was retold in Thomas Bulfinch's Mythology.

"Annelies Marie Frank (Anne) (Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany, 12 June 1929 - Bergen-Belsen, February 1945) was a German - Jewish girl. She died during World War II, along with 6 million other Jews. She perished in the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen, Germany, in February 1945. She died of Typhoid Fever, an infectious illness usually passed onto humans by flea bites. Anne Frank became famous only after her death because of a diary she had written. After the war was over, the diary was published and has been translated into more than 70 languages. Anne is the symbol today which represents the 6 million other Jewish people who died during the Second World War. There have been many books written about her and there are also theatre plays which have been written, based on her diary. Anne received the diary as a gift from her parents for her 13th birthday, on 12 June 1942. The very first words she wrote in the diary were: I hope that I can entrust everything to you, as I have not been able to do to anyone, and I hope that you will be a great support to me. — 12 June 1942 Anne was the daughter of Otto and Edith Frank-Holländer. She had an older sister named Margot, who was born on 16 February 1926. On 13 March 1932, there was an election in Germany, in which the Nazis (people who followed Hitler) won many votes. Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933. Anne's parents realized that they and the children had no future in Germany because Adolf Hitler persecuted Jews. They fled to Amsterdam in 1933 and went to live at Merwedeplein 37 on the second floor. Anne's father Otto went to the Netherlands in the summer of 1933, Edith went in November, Anne and Margot went to their Grandmother's house in Aachen (near the Dutch border). Margot went to the Netherlands in December 1933 and Anne followed in February 1934, where she was put on the table as a birthday present for Margot. Anne and Margot both went to school in the neighborhood and learned Dutch. Anne had many friends at school and in the neighborhood, and she enjoyed playing with them. Anne loved skating, reading, watching films and she collected pictures of movie stars. The Frank family were liberal Jews. That meant that they felt connections with Jewish traditions, but were not strict about following the rules. Anne Frank had a wonderful time in Amsterdam, until the German army filed into the Netherlands and occupied it in May 1940. In 1941, everyone had to report and register if they were Jewish or Non-Jewish. There followed scores of measures against Jews and other groups that the Nazis wanted to exterminate, including Gypsies (Sinti and Roma), people with disabilities, and homosexuals. Jews weren't allowed to go to the cinema, the swimming pool, and Jewish children like Anne had to go to a Jewish school with other Jewish students. Jews were made to stay away from others. On 29 June 1942, notices were posted in all Dutch newspapers stating that the German occupiers had decided that all Jews must be sent to work camps in Germany. Margot was one of the first Jews who, on 5 July 1942, received a letter telling her that she had to go to a work camp. Anne heard from her father the following morning that they were going into hiding. Onto the back of her Father's company building at Prinsengracht 263, a small house had been built, which stood empty. It was called the ""Achterhuis"" (Secret annex) and it was part of the company ""Opekta"", which Otto Frank was a director of. On 6 July 1942, they hid themselves in that little house. Many people didn't believe that they had to go to Germany to work. They looked for houses where they could hide with the help of residents. They hoped to stay out of the hands of the Germans. But that was not easy. You had to find a place and people who would help you. It was also dangerous, because going into hiding was forbidden. The father and mother of Anne Frank had also come up with a plan. They'd been taking things to the secret annex. Four people who worked for Otto Frank decided that they wanted to help, and they all went into hiding together; Hermann van Pels, Auguste van Pels and their son Peter van Pels and later, Fritz Pfeffer. People worked for Otto Frank's company during the week and also on Saturdays. They were absolutely not allowed to know that people were in hiding in the secret annex. There were only 4 people who knew and helped those hiding there: Miep Gies, Bep Voskuijl, Johannes Kleiman and Victor Kugler. They provided food and clothing and everything else that the people in hiding needed, such as textbooks for Margot, Anne and Peter. They made curtains for the windows, and they had to be very quiet so that people who worked at the company during the day, didn't hear them. They knew that there were very heavy penalties for going into hiding, so there was a constant fear of being discovered. During the day, they could not even go to the toilet - because if they did, the people working at the company would find out there were people hiding there. They had to wait until all the people who worked there during the day, went home. Nobody knew how long the war would last. Anne regularly wrote in her diary. It became her best friend and she called it ""Kitty"". One day in 1942, Anne wrote in her diary: ""Our hiding place has only now become a real hiding place. Mr Kugler (a friend of her Father) thought it would be better to place a cupboard in front of our entrance door - but of course, a cupboard that can be rotated and that opens like a door."" Anne Frank and the other people in hiding hoped that the Germans would not find them. They thought themselves safe in the house on Prinsengracht in Amsterdam. But unfortunately, on 4 August 1944, their hiding place was discovered. The person who arrested them was called Karl Silberbauer. On 4 August 1944, a car stopped in front of the house at Prinsengracht 263 somewhere between 10:00 and 10:30am. The SS Squadron Leader, Karl Silberbauer, stepped out together with around three Dutch helpers. They had been betrayed by someone, but to this day, nobody knows who gave their secret away. It is also possible that they had been discovered during a house search. The people who had hidden there, had been there for more than two years, having arrived on 6 July 1942. Shortly after the Frank family was captured, Anne's diary and other papers were found in the secret annex by Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl. All 8 of the people who had been in hiding were taken to Camp Westerbork on 8 August, thereafter they were transported to the concentration and extermination camp at Auschwitz. Auschwitz was in Poland, which had also been occupied by the Germans. That was for Anne, the last time that she saw her father. From Auschwitz, Anne and her sister Margot were taken to the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen in Germany. Anne met one of her best friends from Amsterdam there. Her name was Hanneli Goslar. Hanneli had it somewhat better than Anne, because she sometimes got food parcels from the Red Cross. She tried to help Anne by throwing some of the food to her over the fence. Bergen-Belsen laid between the German cities of Hamburg and Hannover. Anne Frank died of Typhoid Fever around February 1945, a few days after her sister Margot. She was not even 16 years old. Six of the other hiders from the Secret Annex were taken there too. Her father, Otto Frank, was the only one from her family who remained alive.",Easy

In 1755, he joined the Royal Navy, he was named Captain in 1768. This seaman was known to have drawn very accurate maps. In particular, he discovered New Caledonia on September 4, 1774, also the Sandwich islands (Hawaii). In 1759 he married Elizabeth Batts of Shadwell. From 1768 to 1771, James Cook explored the South Pacific Ocean with the intent to observe the Venus transit of 1769 and to seek an hypothetic southern continent. In 1769, he lived in Tahiti and the Company islands. Then he explored the seas to the south of Tahiti and headed west, not having discovered the mythical southern continent. He discovered NewZealand, then he completed the findings of previous explorers of New-Holland (now Australia). In September 1770, he had repaired his ship in Batavia in the Dutch Indies, then he retuned to England. During this journey, he applied the advice of doctors to fight against scurvy. In 1772 to 1775, Cook left with two ships to explore the most southerly parts of the oceans one more time in order to find an supposed continent. He met icebergs and approached Antarctica, without finding it however Cook then headed towards the Pacific Islands.

"A verb is a kind of word (see part of speech) that usually tells about an action or a state and is the main part of a sentence. Every sentence has a verb. In English, verbs are the only kind of word that changes to show past or present tense. Every language in the world has verbs, but they are not always used in the same ways. They also can have different properties in different languages. For example, in some other languages (e.g., Chinese & Indonesian) verbs do not change for past and present tense. This means the definition above only works well for English verbs. There are sixteen verbs used in Basic English. They are: be, do, have, come, go, see, seem, give, take, keep, make, put, send, say, let, get. The word verb originally comes from *were-, a Proto-Indo-European word meaning ""a word"". It comes to English through the Latin verbum and the Old French verbe. In simple sentences, the verb may be one word: The cat sat on the mat. However, the verb may be a whole phrase: The cat will sit on the mat. Verbal phrases can be extremely difficult to analyse: I'm afraid I will need to be going soon. There seem to be three verbal phrases here, which add to something like Sorry, I must go soon. In English and many other languages, verbs change their form. This is called inflection. Most English verbs have six inflected forms (see the table), but be has eight different forms. You should notice that some of the verb forms look the same. You can say they have the same shape. For example, the plain present and the plain form of walk have the same shape. The same is true for the past and the past participle. But these different forms can have different shapes in other verbs. For example, the plain present of be is usually are but the plain form is be. Also, the past of eat is ate, but the past participle is eaten. When you look for a verb in the dictionary, it is usually the plain form that you look for. An English sentence must have at least one primary-form verb. Each main clause can only have one primary-form verb. English has two main kinds of verbs: normal verbs (called lexical verbs) and auxiliary verbs. The difference between them is mainly in where they can go in a sentence. Some verbs are in both groups, but there are very few auxiliary verbs in English. There are also two kinds of auxiliary verbs: modal verbs and non-modal verbs. The table below shows most of the English auxiliaries and a small number of other verbs. There are several auxiliary verbs: The follow verbs are modal auxiliaries Auxiliary verbs also inflect for negation. Usually this is done by adding not or n't. Sometimes the verb do. It does not really change the meaning. It is also used in the negative when no other auxiliary verbs are used. Many other languages do not use the verb do as an auxiliary verb. They use the simple present for do, and the simple past or perfect for 'did Many people think that all different ways of using verbs are all different tenses. This is not true. There are three main systems related to the verb: tense, aspect, and mood. Tense is mainly used to say when the verb happens: in the past, present, or future. In order to explain and understand tense, it is useful to imagine time as a line on which past tense, present tense and future tense are positioned. Some languages have all three tenses, some have only two, and some have no tenses at all. English and Japanese for example have only two tenses: past and present. Chinese and Indonesian verbs do not show tense. Instead they use other words in the sentence to show when the verb happens. Aspect usually shows us things like whether the action is finished or not, or if something happens regularly. English has two aspects: progressive and perfect. In English, aspect is usually shown by using participle verb forms. Aspect can combine with present or past tense. English uses the gerund-participle, usually together with the auxiliary be (and its forms am, is, are, was, and were) to show the progressive aspect. Many other languages, such as French, do not use progressive tenses. The past perfect can be used to express an unrealized hope, wish, etc. After If, wish and would rather, the past perfect can be used to talk about past events that never happened. Finally, English mood is now usually shown by using modal verbs. In the past, English had a full mood system but that has almost completely disappeared. The subjunctive mood now uses the plain form. There is also a form of be that is used in conditionals to show that something is not true (e.g., If I were a bird, I would fly to California.) Certain parts of a sentence naturally come before verbs or after them, but these are not always the same for all verbs. The main sentence parts are: subject, object, complement, and modifier. Almost all English sentences have subjects, but sentences that are orders (called imperatives) usually do not have any subjects. A subject usually comes before a verb, but it can also come after auxiliary verbs. In the following examples, the subject is underlined and the primary verb is in bold. Many verbs can be followed by an object. These verbs are called transitive verbs. In fact, some verbs must have an object (e.g., take), but some verbs never take an object (e.g., sleep). Verbs that do not take an object are called intransitive verbs. Some verbs can even have two objects. They are called ditransitive verbs. In the following examples, the object is underlined and the primary verb is in bold. Some verbs can or must be followed by a complement. These verbs are called linking verbs or copula. In the following examples, the complement is underlined and the verb is in bold. Verbs can be modified by various modifiers, mainly adverbs. Note that verbs generally do not need modifiers; it's usually a choice. In the following examples, the adverb is underlined and the verb is in bold. Verbs also commonly take a variety of other modifiers including prepositions. Sometimes a verb and another word can have the same shape. In these cases you can usually see the difference by looking at various properties of the words. Sometimes a verb and an adjective can have the same shape. Usually this happens with participles. For example, the present participle interesting and the adjective interesting look the same. Verbs are different from adjectives, though, because they cannot be modified by very, more, or most. For example, you can say ""That is very interesting,"" so you know interesting is an adjective here. But you cannot say ""My teacher is very interesting me in math"" because in this sentence interesting is a verb. On the other hand, if you cannot change the 'be' verb to 'seem' or 'become', it is probably a verb. The gerund-particle sometimes looks like a noun. This is especially true when it is used as a subject, as in the following example: The main differences between these verbs and nouns are: modifiers, number, and objectcomplement Verbs cannot generally be modified by adjectives and nouns cannot generally be modified by adverbs. So, in ""Running regularly is good for you"", running is a verb because it is modified by regularly, an adverb. Verbs cannot change for number, so if you can make the word plural, it is a noun, not a verb. For example, ""this drawing is nice"" can change to ""these drawings are nice"", so drawing is a noun. But ""drawing trees is fun"" cannot change to ""drawings trees is fun"", so it is a verb here. Many verbs can take objects or complements, but nouns cannot. So, in ""parking the car is hard"", parking is a verb because it takes the object the car. But, if you say, ""there's no parking"", parking may be a noun because it does not have an object. Some verbs have become prepositions. Again, usually these share a shape with participles. Here are some examples: The main difference between verbs and prepositions is that verbs have a subject. Even if the subject is not written, you can understand what it is. Prepositions do not have a subject.",Easy
"Dhaka is the capital and most populous city of Bangladesh in southern Asia. The urban area had 15.391 million people as of 2011. Set beside the Buriganga River, it’s at the center of national government, trade and culture. The 17th-century old city was the Mughal capital of Bengal, and many palaces and mosques remain. American architect Louis Khan’s National Parliament House complex typifies the huge, fast-growing modern metropolis. Dhaka is the financial, commercial and the entertainment capital of Bangladesh, and accounts for up to 35% of Bangladesh's economy. Since its establishment as a modern capital city the population, area, social and economic diversity of Dhaka have grown tremendously, the city is now one of the most densely industrialized regions in Bangladesh. Dhaka is a major beta-global city, as it hosts the headquarters of several international corporations. By the 21st century, it emerged as a megacity. The Dhaka Stock Exchange has over 750 listed companies. The city hosts over 50 diplomatic missions and the headquarters of BIMSTEC. The city's culture is known for its cycle-rickshaws, cuisine, art festivals and religious diversity. The old city is home to around 2 000 buildings from the Mughal and British periods, including notable structures such as the Bara Katra and Choto Katra caravansaries. The origins of the name for Dhaka are uncertain. Once dhak trees were very common in the area and the name may have originated from it. Alternatively, this name may refer to the hidden Hindu goddess Dhakeshwari, whose temple is located in the south-western part of the city. Another popular theory states that Dhaka refers to a membranophone instrument, dhak which was played by order of Subahdar Islam Khan I during the inaugurating of the Bengal capital in 1610. Some references also say it was derived from a Prakrit dialect called Dhaka Bhasa; or Dhakka, used in the Rajtarangini for a watch-station; or it is the same as Davaka, mentioned in the Allahabad pillar inscription of Samudragupta as an eastern frontier kingdom. According to Rajatarangini written by a Kashmiri Brahman, Kalhana, the region was originally known as Dhakka. The word Dhakka means watchtower. Bikrampur and Sonargaon—the earlier strongholds of Bengal rulers were situated nearby. So Dhaka was most likely used as the watchtower for the fortification purpose. Dhaka, Bangladesh's vibrant capital city, has a rich and varied history spanning millennia. Dhaka's history is a fascinating journey through the ebb and flow of cultures, religions, and civilizations. This article delves into Dhaka's historical tapestry, unravelling the layers that have shaped this city into the dynamic cultural and economic center that it is today. The history of Dhaka can be traced back to the ancient period when it was known as Dhaka-kola. The region served as an important center for trade and commerce, connecting the hinterlands with the Silk Road. Over the centuries, various empires, including the Mauryas, Guptas, and Pala dynasties, exerted their influence on the area, contributing to its cultural and architectural evolution. Dhaka rose to prominence during the medieval period under the Delhi Sultanate and later the Bengal Sultanate. It became a strategic administrative and commercial center, attracting merchants and artisans from across the Indian subcontinent and beyond. The city's growth was accelerated during the Mughal era when it became a provincial capital under the rule of Emperor Akbar. The Lalbagh Fort, an iconic Mughal structure, stands as a testament to this period, though it was left incomplete due to historical circumstances. The arrival of European colonizers in the 17th century marked a new chapter in Dhaka's history. The city passed through Portuguese, Dutch, and finally British hands. Under British rule, Dhaka evolved into a significant center for trade and administration. The British legacy is evident in the architectural marvels scattered across the city, including the Ahsan Manzil and the Dhaka University campus. Dhaka played a pivotal role in the struggle for independence, culminating in the birth of Bangladesh in 1971. The Jatiyo Sangsad Bhaban, designed by renowned architect Louis Kahn, witnessed the proclamation of independence. The Liberation War Museum stands as a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made during this tumultuous period. In the post-independence era, Dhaka has undergone rapid urbanization and transformation. The city has emerged as a major economic, political, and cultural hub in South Asia. Its skyline is adorned with modern skyscrapers, and the streets buzz with the energy of a growing population.",Easy
"Yggdrasil is a central sacred tree in the beliefs of Norse mythology. It is the tree upon which the Nine Realms of the Norse mythos rests upon and of which one of three roots sprawl down into the Well called Mímisbrunnr, guarded by Mimir and lying in the lands of the jǫtunn, another root sprawls into the lands of the æsir and into the Urðarbrunnr, where the nornir gather water to give to the tree.

"Masjid al-Haram, translated as the ""Sacred Mosque,"" stands as the holiest site in Islam, nestled in the heart of the city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia. As the focal point of the annual Hajj pilgrimage and a revered site for Muslims around the world, Masjid al-Haram holds profound historical, architectural, and religious significance. The history of Masjid al-Haram dates back to the time of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son Prophet Isma'il (Ishmael). According to Islamic tradition, they were commanded by Allah to construct the Kaaba, the cubic structure at the center of Masjid al-Haram, as a place of worship. Over the centuries, the mosque has undergone various expansions and renovations, with the current structure being the result of multiple phases of development. The grandeur of Masjid al-Haram lies not only in its historical importance but also in its architectural magnificence. The mosque encompasses the Kaaba, a black cubic structure draped in a gold-embroidered black silk and cotton veil known as the kiswah. The courtyard around the Kaaba can accommodate millions of worshippers during the Hajj pilgrimage, making it one of the largest mosques in the world. The mosque's distinctive feature is the Black Stone, or Hajar al-Aswad, set into the eastern corner of the Kaaba. Pilgrims ritually touch or kiss the Black Stone during the Tawaf, the act of circumambulating the Kaaba, as part of the Hajj pilgrimage. Masjid al-Haram holds unparalleled significance in Islam as the house of Allah and the epicenter of Islamic rituals. Muslims around the world face the Kaaba during their daily prayers, uniting the global Muslim community in worship. The annual Hajj pilgrimage, a fundamental pillar of Islam, draws millions of Muslims to Masjid al-Haram, where they perform a series of rituals commemorating the actions of Prophet Ibrahim and his family. The Zamzam Well, located within the mosque's vicinity, is another sacred element tied to Islamic history. According to tradition, the well miraculously appeared to provide water for the infant Isma'il and his mother, Hagar, in their desperate state. Throughout history, various caliphs and rulers have undertaken the responsibility of preserving and expanding Masjid al-Haram to accommodate the growing number of pilgrims. The most recent expansion, known as the King Abdulaziz Expansion, aimed to increase the mosque's capacity, enhance its facilities, and improve the overall experience for worshippers.",Easy

"Microsoft Windows is a trademark of operating system for computers. The most recent versions of the system are Microsoft Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. The current versions of Windows have their roots in two fundamentally different pieces of software marketed under the common name ""Windows"". The oldest one (""DOS-based"") brought most graphical interface aspects (windows, task bar, start button...) while the other one (""NT-based"") brought the underlying stability and security. A third family of Windows software is devoted to embedded and mobile devices but the latest versions of Windows Phone are now NT-based as well. In the old days, most IBM-compatible personal computers were equipped with the operating system Microsoft DOS. IBM itself provided it as default operating system on its personal computers under the name PC-DOS. Microsoft developed Windows, a graphical user interface on top of DOS. Windows 1.0 went out in 1985. Windows 3.0 (1990) was the first popular version of Windows, with 7 million copies sold in the first year (mostly because Windows was then sold together with DOS when people bought a computer). Until Windows 3.1 (1992) and Windows for Workgroup 3.11 (which brought some networking features in 1993), one had to buy and install DOS and then Windows. Starting with Windows 95 (which came out in 1995), both layers were combined into one product. Further evolutions of this branch included Windows 98 (1998) and Windows ME (Millenium Edition, in September 2000). As the hardware was evolving, IBM and Microsoft had started in 1985 to work together on a new operating system called OS2 that would include a number of fundamental improvements and be aimed at replacing DOS. A few versions of OS2 had been released already and a new version was being developed. Due to the success of Windows 3.0, Microsoft then decided to make the new version of OS2 somewhat compatible with Windows, while IBM was against this idea: that's where their collaboration ended and IBM continued alone to develop OS2 as originally intended. Microsoft pursued its new idea of an operating system providing extended Windows capabilities instead of extended OS2 capabilities. That became Windows NT whose first version, released in 1993, immediately bore the number 3.1. It was marketed as an operating system for professional environments, with several variants targeting workstations and servers. Windows NT 3.51 (1995) and Windows NT 4.0 (1996) had a lot of success. They were followed in February 2000 by Windows 2000 (internally known as Windows NT 5.0). Windows CE is yet a different operating system created by Microsoft, designed to take as little storage space as possible. It is not based on DOS, nor on OS2 and Windows NT. Microsoft licences it to other companies for them to create user interfaces in all kinds of electronic devices. Microsoft itself has used Windows CE to create interfaces for mobile devices such as smartphones: these versions were known as Pocket PC (released in 2000), Windows Mobile (from 2003 to 2009) and Windows Phone 7 (released in 2010). Windows XP (internally bearing the version number 5.1) was released in 2001. It was the first version based on Windows NT intended for all end-users, for both personal and professional usages (""Home"" and ""Professional"" editions). Thanks to its Windows NT bases, this version brings a tremendous increase in security, stability and performance to end-users in the consumer market (personal usage). A new version of Windows XP (v.5.2) came out in 2003 that supports 64-bits computer architectures. Further versions include Windows Vista (released in 2006 for professionals and 2007 for the general public, internally numbered v.6.0), Windows 7 (2009, v.6.1), Windows 8 (2012, v.6.2) and Windows 8.1, with the most current iteration being Windows 10 (2015, v.10.06.4). As with previous Windows NT versions, the same code base is also used for server versions. For marketing reasons, Microsoft gave server versions other names than end-users versions. Server versions equivalent to Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 are called respectively Windows Server 2003 (v.5.2, there is no equivalent to v.5.1), Windows Server 2008 (v.6.0), Windows Server 2008 R2 (v.6.1), Windows Server 2012 (v.6.2), Windows Server 2012 R2 (v.6.3) and Windows Server 2016.

"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Hindi: मोहनदास करमचन्द गांधी, Mohāndās Karamchand Gāndhī; Gujarati: મોહનદાસ કરમચંદ ગાંધી; 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was a leader of nationalism in British-ruled India. He is more commonly called Mahatma Gandhi; mahatma is an honorific meaning ""high-souled"" or ""venerable"" in Sanskrit. He was first called this in 1914 in South Africa. He is also called Bapu in India (Gujarati endearment for ""father"", ""papa""). He was the Martyr of the Nation since 1948. Rabindranath Tagore gave him this name. Gandhi was one of the most important people involved in the movement for the independence of India. He was a non-violent activist, who led the independence movement through a non-violent protest. Mohandas Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, Gujarat, India. Several members of his family worked for the government of the state. When Gandhi was 18 years old, he went to England to study law. After he became a lawyer, he went to the British colony of South Africa where he experienced laws that said people with dark skin had fewer rights than people with light skin. He decided then to become a political activist, so he could help change these unfair laws. He created a powerful, non-violent movement. During Gandhi's life, India was a colony of the United Kingdom, but wanted independence. In 1930, Gandhi led the Salt March. When he returned to India, he helped bring about the country's independence from British rule, inspiring other colonial people to work for their own independence, break up the British Empire, and replace it with the Commonwealth. People of many different religions and ethnic groups lived in British India. Many people thought that the country should break into separate countries so that different groups could have their own countries. In particular, many people thought that Hindus and Muslims should have separate countries. Gandhi was a Hindu, but he liked ideas from many religions including Islam, Judaism and Christianity, and he thought that people of all religions should have the same rights, and could live together peacefully in the same country. In 1938, Gandhi resigned from Congress. He said that he was no longer able to work through Congress to unite the divisions in caste and religion. He also felt that he had little to offer to the political process. In 1947, India became independent from the British Empire and formed two separate countries: India and Pakistan. Gandhi wanted independence, but did not want the split into two different countries. Instead of celebrating on independence day, he was mourning the division of India. Gandhi's principle of satyagraha, often translated as ""way of truth"" or ""pursuit of truth"", has inspired other democratic and anti-racist activists like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Nelson Mandela. Gandhi often said that his values were simple, based upon traditional Hindu beliefs: truth (satya), and non-violence (ahimsa). On January 30, 1948, Gandhi was assassinated by an extremist Hindu activist, Nathuram Godse, who was angry because he felt that Gandhi was too lenient towards Muslims.

"Santa Claus is a fictional Christmas character. He is loosely based on St. Nicholas, the patron saint of children. Santa Claus is an elf who lives at the North Pole. He makes toys for children. He rides through the sky on Christmas Eve in a sleigh drawn by reindeer. He lands on the roof of a house in his sleigh, then drops down the chimney. He leaves toys for all the children in the house under the Christmas tree and in their Christmas stockings. Over the years, many customs have grown up around Santa Claus. For instance, children write letters to Santa and mail them to his workshop at the North Pole. They leave cookies and milk for him on Christmas Eve, and carrots for his reindeer. In some places, children go to department stores to tell one of ""Santa's helpers"" what toys they want for Christmas. Santa Claus is a character in stories and poems such as The Night Before Christmas by Clement Clarke Moore, The Story of Santa Claus by L.

"The Blobfish (scientific name: Psychrolutes) is a marine fish which lives at very great depths in the abysses of Australia and New Zealand. ""Blobfish"" is its English name, in reference to its slack appearance. Indeed, the blobfish is very well adapted to its environment and its body is slack and gelatinous, giving it a strange look when you take it out of the water. There are actually several species of blobfish, which are very similar. While people don't eat it, the blobfish is nonetheless an endangered animal due to overfishing. The blobfish really is a strange animal. Its weird appearance has gotten it classified on the internet as the ""World's Ugliest Animal"". Furthermore, it is not very well known, and very few people have had the chance to see it in its natural environment. This is normal: the blobfish lives near the bottom of the sea, at very great depths: up to 1200 meters! Because of this it's very difficult to observe, and most blobfish that can be seen are those which have been brought up to the surface by fishermen. Although the body of the blobfish looks very bizarre when brought up to the surface, it is perfectly adapted to the bottom of the sea. For instance, the blobfish has no swim bladder (the swim bladder is a pouch filled with gas, like a small balloon inside the body most finned fishes; by inflating or deflating the swim bladder, a fish can float more or less high in the water, using Archimedes' principle by varying in density). But at very great depths, the water exerts enormous pressure which would probably burst the swim bladder, most ""normal"" fish therefore wouldn't be able to live this deep. But the blobfish has no swim bladder. It disappeared from its ancestors a long time ago. As a result, they do not fear large pressures and they can therefore live very deep in the ocean. Without a swim bladder, one might think that the blobfish does not float, and that it should have to swim relentlessly to stop itself from sinking. The second special feature of the blobfish is that its flesh, that is to say, its muscles, have a gelatinous consistency and are less dense than water. Even though he has no swim bladder, the blobfish can thus naturally float a little above the bottom ocean without having to spend too much energy. The blobfish is definitely very well adapted to its lifestyle in the deep. With his gelatinous muscle, the blobfish is not a great swimmer: it is not very fast and therefore prefers prey that are immobile or slower than it. It is an opportunistic predator, that is to say, it eats whatever it happens to catch. They eat primarily pennatules, sea snails, or crabs. It can also feed on marine snow, a substance that falls permanently on the seabed from the surface. Blobfish habits are poorly known, as very few have been observed in their natural environment. However, we often find scars of suckers on larger blobfish. So we think that blobfish, in turn, are eaten by larger molluscs such as squids or octopus. Because of its gelatinous and extremely acidic flesh, the blobfish is not edible, so it does not interest fishermen. Yet, paradoxically, it is a victim of overfishing. Fishermen use special nets called trawls to scrape the bottom of the sea and to capture crustaceans such as lobsters. However, these nets do not differentiate in the things they catch and thus capture many other species such as the blobfish.",Easy

"The Sri Lankan elephant (scientific name: Elephas maximus maximus) is an Asian elephant (scientific name: Elephas maximus). It is one of the three subspecies of the Asian elephant. The other two subspecies are the Indian elephant (scientific name: Elephas maximus indicus) and the Sumatran elephant (scientific name: Elephas maximus sumatranus). The Sri Lankan elephant is the largest of the three subspecies. They are about 11ft tall, and can weigh up to 12,000lb. They eat leaves, shrubs, grasses, and other plants. These elephants are native to Sri Lanka, and once lived far and wide over the entire island. They now live in the dry zones in the north, east, and southeast. There are many national parks where tourists may see the elephant. These elephants were always useful animals in Sri Lanka. They carried timber and participated in public events like the Procession of Buddha's Tooth. They were hugely numerous in the past and aggressively hunted. In modern times, they are protected by law. Killing one carries the death penalty. They are an endangered species because farming and other human developments are destroying their living areas. Asian elephants are usually smaller than African elephants. Females are usually smaller than males. Females may live to about 46 years; it is uncertain how long the males live. The Asian elephant's highest body point is on the head. The tip of their trunk is used like a finger. Their back is curved upward or level. Their ears are smaller than those of the African elephant. Their feet have more ""nails"" than those of African elephants. They have five ""nails"" on each front foot, and four on each back foot. Only 7% of Sri Lankan male elephants develop tusks. A tusk is a very long tooth that protrudes from the elephant's mouth. An elephant with huge tusks is called a ""tusker"". Females have short or no tusks. Sri Lankan elephants are the largest subspecies of the Asian elephant. Their shoulder height is between 6 and 11ft. They weigh between 4,000 and 12,000lb. Like humans, apes, and dolphins, they have a large and well developed brain. They are very smart. Elephants have the largest brain of all land animals. Their memory is awesome. They can remember places, people, and events from long in the past. Their skin color is darker than that of the two other Asian subspecies. They may have large patches of skin color loss (depigmentation) on ears, face, trunk, and tummy. The Sri Lankan elephant was once widespread on the island of Sri Lanka. In modern times, they mostly live in the island's dry zones of the north, east, and southeast. These are mainly dry deciduous woodland, scrub, grassland, and marshes. The elephant does not live in the island's wet zones. Some Sri Lankan elephants live in protected areas like national parks. Like the two other subspecies of Asian elephants, Sri Lankan elephants live in groups of 6 to 15 individuals that are related by blood. The group is led by a matriarch. She may be the oldest and most experienced of the females in the group. Sometimes a group will join another group to become a clan. The clan may then join another group or clan to become a herd. A mother and her babies have strong ties. Babies nurse for 2 to 5 years. All elephants in the group will help in different ways to raise and protect the babies. When males reach the age of sexual maturity, the matriarch and other members of the group will force them away. This is so these males will not mate with their relatives. The babies of such close unions will very likely be inferior babies. Some babies may even have birth defects. Young males often form bachelor groups. Males become more solitary as they grow older. Adult males join females only for mating. Males do not help in raising the babies. Sri Lankan elephants are both browsers and grazers. They walk along and eat, and sometimes they stand still and eat what they can reach around them. They eat shrubs, leaves, grasses, and vines. They sometimes raid farm gardens and eat crop plants. Baby and young elephants tend to feed mostly on different grasses. The food the Sri Lankan elephant eats is scarce in mature forests. Farming opens and clears the land though, making ideal places for elephants to find food. Adult elephants eat 300-400lb. of food per day. Asian elephants have poor digestive systems. They use less than 50% of the food they eat. They must eat hundreds of pounds of food every day to support their huge size. These elephants will eat for up to 16 hours a day to meet their need for food. They drink from 25 to 50 gallons of water every day. The elephant produces huge amounts of manure. In the wild, this manure carries and spreads undigested seeds in the elephant's diet. The manure is a source of food for insects and birds. Asian male elephants are called bulls. They reach sexual maturity around the age of 12. Between the age of 10 and 20, bulls enter an annual phase called ""musth"". This is a time when they become sexually aggressive. They will fight other males to mate with a female. Females are called cows. Once having successfully mated, a baby elephant called a calf develops in his mother's womb. He is born after an 18 to 22-month period. Twins are rare. At birth, the calf weighs about 220lb. He nurses from his mother's breasts for up to three years. Once a cow gives birth, she usually does not breed again until the first calf is weaned. This results in a birth interval of 4 to 5 years. Cows remain with their herd, but mature bulls are chased away. In the distant past, Sri Lankan elephants numbered in the hundreds of thousands. They lived in all zones of the island. They were aggressively hunted by Sri Lankans, other Asians, and Europeans. In the 19th century, a British officer was said to have killed 1,500 elephants. Other British officers held similar records. Between 1829 and 1855 alone, more than 6,000 elephants were captured and killed. In 2014, there was an estimated 4,000 elephants on Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan elephant is protected under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance of Sri Lanka (FFPO), and killing it carries the death penalty. Sri Lankan elephants are important to the economic and cultural life of Sri Lanka. Some are working elephants and are used to carry timber. These elephants are losing their jobs because tractors are replacing them. Elephants can be seen in protected areas and national parks. These elephants attract tourists. This trade improves the economy and the lives of Sri Lankans. The elephant has always been held in great cultural esteem in Sri Lanka. Rajah, a Sri Lankan elephant with tusks that nearly touched the ground, was declared a national treasure in 1985. Sri Lankan elephants participate in ceremonies, processions, and other public events. The Esala Perahera (the festival of Buddha's tooth) is held annually in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is thought to date to the 3rd century BC. Elephants lead the procession, bearing the sacred tooth. Sri Lankan elephants face the same threats to survival as other Asian elephant subspecies do. Elephant living areas in Sri Lanka are decreasing, and becoming fragmented because of forest clearing for human settlements and agriculture. This situation promotes conflicts between elephants and humans. These conflicts have led to the death of both humans and elephants, and the destruction of property. The problem is complicated by the elephant's taste for crops grown by humans such as sugar cane, bananas, and other fruits. In 1997, about 126 wild elephants were lost as a result of these conflicts. Conflict between government troops and the terrorist group, the Tamil Tigers in the northeastern region, has also put elephants at great risk.",Easy

The letters q, w, x, and y are gone, and there are new letters ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, and ŭ. What's really different from English is that each Esperanto letter stands for one and only one sound. There are no letters that sound differently in different words (like the a in fat, fate, and father), no silent letters (like the s in island), and no sounds that take more than one letter (like the sh in fish). Most Esperanto letters that are used in English have the same sounds that they usually have in English, and almost all Esperanto letters have sounds that are used in English. The new letter ĥ is different from English, though; it has a sound like clearing your throat. (That's also the way a Scottish person would say the ch in loch.) Here are all the Esperanto letters, and their sounds: The answer is: nobody really knows. Esperanto speakers are hard to count because they are spread all over the world. Esperanto has anywhere from 2,000,000 to 10,000,000 speakers, but most of them learned it later on. Only a few thousand speak it as a native language. A speaker of Esperanto is called an Esperantist. The green star of Esperanto(Verda stelo) The Esperanto Flag(La flago de Esperanto) Jubilee symbol(Jubilea simbolo) Esperanto is spoken all over the world. Really! However, most Esperantists learn Esperanto as a second language, so nowhere is it the language of the majority of people. Esperanto speakers live in the same places as speakers of other languages. In order to identify themselves to other Esperanto speakers, Esperantists use a number of symbols. The green star of Esperanto, the verda stelo, is the oldest and most commonly used symbol. It is incorporated into the Esperanto flag. A more recent symbol called the jubilee symbol (jubilea simbolo) was designed in 1987. It is common to see all three of these symbols at an Esperanto event. Esperanto is a constructed language invented by Jewish-Polish eye doctor L.L. Zamenhof (1859 – 1917). He grew up in a city in Poland that was divided between groups who spoke different languages and did not get along. He hoped that if everyone could understand each other, they could live together in peace. In 1872, when he was only 13 years old, he began designing a language called Lingwe uniwersala (""universal language""). In 1878, at age 19, he shared his new language with a few close friends, but then he left for university to study medicine and left all of the notes about his language with his father for safe keeping. Unfortunately, his father was afraid that the idea of a universal language would cause trouble with the Russian Tsar who ruled Poland at the time, so he burned them. Zamenhof found out that all of his work had been destroyed when he came home from university in 1881. He immediately started constructing a new, improved version, which he now called Lingvo universala (which means ""universal language"" in modern Esperanto). For six years he tried to publish his new language, but the censors of the Tsar would not allow it. Instead of surrendering his dream, he used this time to improve the language and practice using it to translate many works. In 1887, Zamenhof published Unua Libro (""First Book""), to describe his universal language. Zamenhof did not use his real name when he published the book because he had already had so much trouble with the Tsar's censors. Instead, he published the book under the name Doktoro Esperanto, which is ""Dr. Someone-who-hopes"" in the language he was introducing. The name ""Esperanto"" (which means ""someone who hopes"" in Esperanto), became the name of the language. Because the language was so simple, and because there were already lots of things written in Esperanto (which Zamenhof had either written or translated while waiting on the Tsar's censors), it caught on very quickly. By 1905, the first World Congress of Esperanto (Universala Kongreso) was held in Boulogne-sur-Mer in France. By the time World War I had started in 1914, Zamenhof had been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize twice, Esperanto was part of the school curriculum in China, Samos and Macedonia, and there was even an Esperanto currency (the spesmilo). Unfortunately, Zamenhof died in 1917, and did not live to see the end of the war in 1918. After World War I, Esperanto's popularity began to soar. The horrors of the war created a desire in people for a universal peace, and Esperanto seemed the best hope for a universal language to foster communication to prevent war from happenning again. The League of Nations—the precursor to the modern United Nations—officially recommended that its members use Esperanto as a second language, and some of the most important scientific associations suggested that Esperanto be used for future scientific communication. For a while it seemed that Esperanto would become the international language for communication, science, and, of course, peace—this time, the 1920s, is considered to be the golden age of Esperanto. But the great dictators that arose in the early days of World War II—Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin—banned and brutally suppressed Esperanto. Hitler believed that there was a secret plan by Jews to rule the world, and had over six million Jewish people murdered in death camps. Since Zamenhof himself was Jewish, Hitler believed the creation of Esperanto was part of this plan, and many Esperanto speakers were killed in death camps, including members of Zamenhof's family. Meanwhile, Joseph Stalin initially promoted the language but later on banned it because he later thought it was dangerous. The League of Nations, along with many prominent Esperanto associations, did not survive the war. Since then, slowly the Esperanto movement has been rebuilding, although it is not yet at the levels it was at before World War II. Although the United Nations does not support Esperanto in the same way that the League of Nations did, some United Nations agencies support the language. The Internet and organizations like Pasporta Servo (which allows Esperanto speakers to travel by staying with other Esperantists around the world) have allowed Esperantists to keep in touch in ways they could not have in the past. Esperanto now exists only through the enthusiasm of its speakers, without the support of any nation or major international organization. L. L. Zamenhof (1859 – 1917), Zamenhof himself was the first Esperanto author. While he was waiting for the censors to allow him to publsh his language, he improved it by using it to translate a number of works, including Shakespeare. He also wrote a number of original Esperanto books and poems. Julio Baghy (1891 – 1967), Hungarian actor who wrote novels and poetry in Esperanto, and was very influential in the early development of the language for poetic use. His most famous novel is Printempo en Aŭtuno (""Springtime in Autumn"", 1931), but he is more well known for his poetry. His most influential work is his collection of poems, Preter la vivo (""Beyond Life"", 1922). William Auld (1924 – 2006), Scottish poet who was nominated three times (1999, 2004 and 2006) for the Nobel Prize in Literature for his works in Esperanto. His most famous work is La infana raso (""The Infant Race"", 1956). Claude Piron (1931 – 2008), Swiss linguist who wrote dozens of books on the language, as well as novels, poems and non-fiction books. His most famous work is [[Gerda malaperis! (""Gerda Vanished!""), which is not only an entertaining mystery novel, but is also written so that early chapters use basic Esperanto, which gets more advanced with each chapter.

"The Age of Enlightenment was an 18th century cultural movement in Europe. It was most popular in France, where its leaders included philosophers like Voltaire and Denis Diderot. Diderot helped spread the Enlightenment's ideas by writing the Encyclopédie, the first big encyclopedia. The Enlightenment grew partly out of the earlier scientific revolution and the ideas of René Descartes. The Enlightenment's most important idea was that all people can reason and think for themselves. Because of this, people should not automatically believe what an authority says. People do not even have to believe what churches teach or what priests say. This was a very new idea at the time. Another important idea was that a society is best when everyone works together to create it. Even people with very little power or money should have the same rights as the rich and powerful to help create the society they live in. The nobility should not have special rights or privileges any more. These were very new ideas at the time. They were also dangerous thoughts for the people in power. Many Enlightenment philosophers were put in prison or were forced to leave their home countries. Many of the Founding Fathers of the United States believed the Enlightenment's ideas. For example, the idea that a government's job is to benefit all of a country's people - not just the people in power - was very important to them. They made this idea about a government ""for the people"" one of the most important parts of the new United States Constitution and the new American government they created. The Enlightenment's ideas were also important to the people who fought in the French Revolution of 1789. In some countries, kings and queens took some of the Enlightenment's ideas and made changes to their governments. However, they still kept power for themselves. These kings and queens were called ""enlightened despots."" Examples include Catherine II of Russia (Catherine the Great), Frederick II of Prussia, and Gustav III of Sweden. During the Age of Enlightenment, as more and more people began to use reason, some began to disagree with the idea that God created the world. This caused conflicts - and, later, war. Many ideas that are important today were created during the Enlightenment. Examples of these ideas include: The Enlightenment's ideas about thinking with reason, having personal freedoms, and not having to follow the Catholic Church were important in creating capitalism and socialism. Important people in the Enlightenment came from many different countries and shared ideas in many different ways. Some of the best-known Enlightenment figures, organized by home country, are: Montesquieu Voltaire Jean-Jacques Rousseau Denis Diderot Immanuel Kant David Hume (1711-1776) Alessandro Volta (1745-1827) Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) Adam Smith",Easy
"The Mona Lisa is an oil painting by Leonardo da Vinci. It was painted in the early 16th century. The painting has been displayed in The Louvre in Paris since 1797. The subject's smile has caused comment for centuries. In modern times, Mona Lisa has been vandalized a few times, and has been stolen once. It is now displayed behind bullet-proof glass. The painting is considered one of the greatest works of art in the western world. Mona Lisa was probably painted between 1503–1506. Da Vinci may have worked on it as late as 1517. Mona Lisa has been painted in oils on a white Lombardy poplar panel. The painting measures 77 cm × 53 cm (30 in × 21 in). The subject of the painting is probably Lisa Gherardini, the wife of silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo of Florence, Italy. Mona is a form of Madonna (my lady) in Italian. Her smile has caused comment for centuries. King Francis I of France bought the painting, and kept it at the Palace of Fontainebleau. The painting was given to King Louis XIV of France. He moved the painting to the Palace of Versailles. In 1797, it was placed on display in The Louvre in Paris. It hangs there now. It was removed for safety several times during modern wars. It is the property of France. In 1911, the Mona Lisa was stolen by an Italian museum guard. The thief took it to Italy. He was hailed by many Italians as a patriot and a national hero. The painting was displayed around Italy in several places. In 1913, the painting was returned to The Louvre. Twice in 1956, the painting was slightly damaged by vandals, but restored. In 1974 and 2009, the painting again was attacked by vandals, but was unharmed. It is now displayed behind bullet-proof glass in a heat and humidity controlled room.",Easy

"The First Folio is the common name for the first complete edition of Shakespeare's plays. It was published in 1623. The term ""folio"" refers to the size of a page; a folio page is about 15 inches (38 cm) tall. It is believed about 750 copies were printed. In its day, the First Folio was an expensive book. Its original price was 1 pound, the equivalent of about £95–£110 or US$190 to $220 in 2006. The book is correctly titled, Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories, & Tragedies. The plays have been categorized into literary genres for the first time: history plays, comedies, and tragedies. These categories have remained in use to the modern age with the addition of ""Romances"". The collection was the project of two of Shakespeare's theatrical colleagues: John Heminges and Henry Condell. It contains all of Shakespeare's plays except Pericles, Prince of Tyre, The Two Noble Kinsman, and the two ""lost plays"", Cardenio and Love's Labour's Won. About half of Shakespeare's plays were printed in what is known as quarto editions during his lifetime. Quarto is the size of a page. It is smaller than a folio. Scholars rely on the First Folio for the texts of the plays not printed in quarto editions. Few copies of the First Folio are extant, with most being in museum and library collections. Other copies are in the hands of millionaire book collectors. Two hundred twenty-eight copies are still in existence. The most (82) are in the Folger Library in Washington, D.C.

Risotto is an Italian dish which consists of rice cooked in stock or broth, together with other ingredients such as meat and vegetables. Usually, people would eat either antipasto or pasta, then the risotto. It is easy and quick to cook. Risotto originates from Italy.The Arabs introduced rice to Italy during the Middle Ages. Shorter-grained rice could be grown well due to the humidity of the Mediterranean climate. Rice became well known throughout Italy. Other countries discovered the quality of the Italian product. Availability of the grain spread, making this rice more widely accessible. A state in Italy called Milan started applying a technique called ‘slow-cooking’ to the short-grained rice. The slow-cooking technique developed the rice’s rich flavors and spices (particularly saffron) for which the area was known, to create ‘Risotto alla Milanese’. Risotto became increasingly popular starting in the northern region, then the central, and southern region. Apart from pasta, risotto is very popular in Italy. The usual ingredients to make risotto are short-grained Italian rice, which is the only kind of rice to make risotto. Arborio rice is recommended. Butter is needed for frying the rice. The soffritto of other ingredients such as onions and shallots would give out the unique flavor and its aroma of the risotto. Meat or seafood would add more flavour to it, for example sausages, sliced beef, prawns, clams, etc. Adding wine is always recommended for enriching the flavors. The type of oil mostly used is olive oil for the risotto’s texture. Chicken broth or stock is required when toasting. Salt and pepper would add to the flavor. Saffron is mainly for the coloring. Before starting, it is better not to wash the rice as its starch helps the risotto keep its traditional look. The rice is placed in the frying pan, together with butter, then toast it lightly. Starts cooking with the broth and later add saffron. Then add the meats and herbs, and mix the rice and vegetables together. While doing so, olive oil could be added when toasting adding to its quality. It is better served when the ready. risotto has a thick and creamy texture. Gualtiero Marchesi is the creator of the newly founded Italian cuisine in Milan. He instructed that the cook has to toast the rice with a little butter. Next, start cooking it with broth and mix it all up with the addition of saffron. While the dish is blending, melt the onion separately in a little butter and white wine. Adding very cold fresh butter will result in having a smooth cream for the Risotto. Stir the risotto with this butter when cooked. One of Italy's most famous dishes is Risotto alla Milanese. In Po Valley, where the bulk of Italian rice grows, Risotto usually is preferred as the first course over pasta. In Venice and Veneto, risotto with sautéed eels is served as a traditional Christmas meal. There were only a few types of risottos in the past. Italians love the taste of the traditional Risotto. Methods of cooking risotto developed through time as new varieties of risottos start to emerge, such as Saffron Risotto with Butternut Squash and Seafood Risotto. Today, many chefs and cooks have created new and delicious risottos because of new ingredients importing in the country. There are many innovations that would change the risotto’s tastes, looks and texture, such as adding extra ingredients like wine or food coloring. In the past, wine wasn’t added to the traditional risotto, while today it is used for flavor, acidity and to add liquid to the risotto, which could also be substituted with others.",Easy

During the 17th and 18th century, Protestants from the United Kingdom settled on the eastern coasts of the continent. In 1773, the British colonies wanted to become independent, but the British crown refused to lose their colonies and a war began between the American and English army. After 8 years of war, called the American Revolutionary War, Great Britain was defeated with the help of the French, and the Americans became independent. They called their country United States of America. After their independence, the USA expanded, and began exploring the western parts of North America, where they found gold. The Indians who lived there, were fought and sometimes massacred by white Americans. The USA also needed to produce crops. To produce these crops, they began abducting Africans from the western coasts of Africa, as slaves. Slaves were badly treated and had to work all day. Slavery was only abolished fully in the country, in 1865, as a result of the Civil War. In 1914, First World War began in Europe. The USA sent its army in Europe in 1917. After the war, the USA became richer, and industrialised itself by selling and exporting objects like cars. In World War II, the USA, allied with France and the United Kingdom, bombed the German army. The 6th June 1944, thousands of American soldiers arrived on the beaches of Normandy. Bit by bit the Germans were defeated, and in 1945 war was won by the Americans, but millions of people had died during the war. At the end of the war, the United States was becoming the richest country in the World. Then, the United States made war against Vietnam. During the Vietnam War, thousands of Vietnamese were killed and 10,000 hectares of plantations were destroyed. The USA was enemy with Russia. The USA was capitalist and Russia communist. In Korea, the USA sent its army against the communists, and at the end of the war, Korea was split in two countries: North Korea and South Korea. In 1969, Neil Armstrong, an astronaut, was sent on the moon. In the US, there was still racism. Black and white people were segregated (separated) in public areas such as buses. An American pastor, Martin Luther King, Jr. fought against racism. In 1963, a civil rights march was organised at Washington. This is where Martin Luther King made his most famous speech ""I have a dream"". But Martin Luther King was assassinated by James Earl Ray while he was standing on his balcony. The 11th September 2001, terrorists from al-Qaeda attacked the World Trade Center, and killed 2,000 people. In 2003, the American army arrived in Iraq, and killed 100,000 people (including civils). Donald Trump is the current President of the USA, since 20 January 2017. 30,000 years ago, the sea was lower, connecting Siberia to Alaska. Tribes followed herds from Asia to America, passing by a stretch of land, called Beringia. They settled in America. Some went to polar areas, becoming Inuit (Eskimos), while others searched more land in the South. They became the first Indians (Christopher Columbus, upon discovering America, thought that he had reached India, and called the inhabitants Indians. Today, they may be called Indians or Indigenous Americans; in the USA, they are called Native Americans or First Nations; in Canada they are named Aboriginals.), and some settled in present-day USA. 10,000 years ago, human populations exterminated all mammoths and horses from the country. Buffaloes were also hunted. Indians would only start to ride horses after these were reintroduced to America by Europeans; in ancient times, travel on land was done by walking. In 700 AD, Indians near the Mississippi began to build large constructions. One of their towns, Cahokia, had over a hundred mounds. The city had a large temple, and a house for the chief and his servants. The town was abandoned around 1500. Around 750, in present-day Southern USA and Northern Mexico, the Pueblo people began to build villages, called pueblos. Some cities from the Pueblo people had houses on top of the others. Pueblo Bonito, in present-day Southern USA, was a large Pueblo city, built in a deep valley and surrounded by a network of roads. Pueblo Bonito had 800 rooms which housed 1,200 people. Its structure was a large semi-circle with buildings on the edge. In the middle of the town were several sunken rooms, called kivas, who were used for ceremonies. The Pueblo people wove their clothes, which were made from brightly dyed cotton. They carved statues from polished stone. Jugs with bold patterns were made by potters. When Pueblo chiefs were buried, pots with painted spirits were buried with them, and pierced to release the spirits. The modern population of Indian nations includes the following: the Apache, the Cherokee, the Cheyenne, the Lakota, the Mohawk, among many others. After the European discovery of the American continent in 1492, settlers began to search land to found colonies in the New World. The Spanish focused their efforts in southern and Central America. After destroying the Aztec civilization, Hernán Cortés established colonies in present-day Mexico. They then headed north and created New Mexico and California, where they encountered various Indian nations. The French, under the reign of Louis XIV, arrived in the Gulf of Mexico, and conquered southeastern North America. This territory was called Louisiana, in French ""Louisiane"", after the name of their king. In 1534, Jacques Cartier discovered Canada. The British began their settlements in America in the 17th century, on the eastern coast. In 1607, a successful settlement was started, and Europeans founded the city of Jamestown. In 1620, a group of English Protestants, eager to worship God in their own way, boarded a ship called the Mayflower. They became known as the Pilgrims, or the Pilgrim Fathers. After sailing across the Atlantic Ocean for three months, they landed in present-day Massachusetts, where they founded the colony of Plymouth. Their first winter was extremely harsh, but the local Indians helped them, and half of the settlers survived. After their first harvest, in November, the Pilgrims organised a meal – including some turkey – to thank the Indians for their help. This is why, on every November, Americans eat turkey, and remember the event, in a day called Thanksgiving. After that episode, more Europeans (mostly English) landed in North America, called the New World. They conquered the eastern coast, creating thirteen colonies, which were later to become a nation. In the 1760s, the United States had already thirteen colonies, but was still controlled by England. As the taxes for the goods coming from England were increasing, the people of the colonies rebelled. In 1773, in the port of Boston, some people assaulted a trade ship transporting tea boxes, which they threw overboard, as a sign of their refusal to pay taxes. The equivalent of 800,000 pounds of tea sank in the sea. This episode was known as the Boston Tea Party. The 4th July 1776, the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence from the British crown. The Declaration of Independence, mostly written by Thomas Jefferson, was adopted that day, and the colonies became an independent country, called ""the United States of America"". The United Kingdom, who didn't want to lose their colonies, sent troops to America. This was the beginning of the War of Independence or American Revolutionary War, which opposed the new American army and the British. The first battles, like the Battle of Long island (1776), or Saratoga (1777), were won by England, whose soldiers were better armed and prepared. But in 1777, Louis XVI, king of France, sent French troops – led by Lafayette – to help the Americans in their fight for independence. Finally, in 1781, at the Battle of Yorktown, the English were defeated. The Thirteen Colonies officially became the United States, and a nation was born. A few years later in 1787, a new set of basic laws called the United States Constitution was written and adopted. In 1789, George Washington, leader of the Thirteen Colonies, became the first president of the United States. Before and after their independence, the United States had trade relations with Europe. To produce their crops, Americans needed workforce. At first, they began using Indians as slaves, but they almost all died. So the colonists later bought new slaves from the western coast of Africa. The African slaves were badly treated. In the ships, they were chained in the hold, and couldn't move for the whole trip. Diseases were quickly spread by rats; most of the slaves fell ill and died. When they arrived in America, the survivors were sold as slaves, to the European landowners. They had to work all day to produce crops, and were whipped by their owners. When slaves tried to escape, they were found and punished, often violently. The northern states of the newly formed USA abolished slavery soon after the independence, around 1800. However, slavery continued in the southern states much later, and was only abolished officially in 1865. When they became an independent country, the United States covered a much smaller territory than today. Only the eastern coast was colonised, while Indians lived in the western part. The southern area of the present-day USA (from California to Texas) was occupied by Spain; and from Newfoundland (eastern Canada) to New Orleans, France had colonies. In 1812, the United States bought French Louisiana from France. All the French territories became American, and the United States doubled its size: this was called the Louisiana Purchase. People from the United States settled in the northern parts of Mexico, in what has become present-day Texas. In 1835, they declared their independence from Mexico. But a war broke up between the Mexicans and the Americans. The Americans were led by Davy Crockett, and the Mexicans by Santa Anna. After ten years of war, including the battle of the Alamo, the Mexicans were defeated and Texas joined the USA. Slowly, people began to settle in the western part of the continent, in what is known as the Wild West, or the American frontier. These settlers, known as pioneers, found, in 1848, gold in California. During this period called the Gold Rush, many Americans rushed there, hoping to find gold in the rivers or in mountains, and become richer. They went there in wagons, pulled by oxen or cows. The journeys were difficult, but some of them found gold. The United States had already won all French Louisiana during the Louisiana Purchase, and Texas during the Texas revolution. Indians lived in the western part of present-day USA. Settlers moved west, where lived Native Americans. Bit by bit, their land was taken away. Some tribes, like the Lakotas (led by Sitting Bull), fought against the US army (led by General Custer) to defend their land. They won some battles, like the battle of Little Big Horn, but were defeated at the battle of Wounded Knee. The US army colonised all Indian territories, killed thousands of buffalo, and forced the Indians who had survived to speak English and live in camps guarded by US soldiers. Once the US army had wiped out all Indian tribes, the map of the US, at the end of the 19th century, looked like the map of present-day US. The country had become one of the most powerful nations of the world. While slavery had been abolished in the early 19th c. in the northern USA, southern states continued to allow slavery for growing cotton and tobacco. In 1860, Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the USA. He was opposed to slavery, and many people in the south were angry with him. The southern states decided to break away from the United States and form an independent country (a process called secession), but the American government rejected that demand. In 1861, a war broke out between the Northern States or Union states, and the Southern states or Confederate states, a war that lasted four years. The Union had more soldiers, called the Yankees, but the Confederate had better generals, and won many battles at first. In 1863, in Pennsylvania, the Union states won the battle of Gettysburg. After this victory, the Yankees advanced in the Southern states. They destroyed and burned cities, towns, villages on their passage. They also broke railway lines to stop the Confederates from bringing provisions, weapons and food to their soldiers. By 1865, the Confederate soldiers became weaker, and they surrendered. The war was ended, but hundreds of soldiers had died on both sides, in land and naval battles, and large areas in the southern states had been destroyed. Slavery was finally abolished, and thousands of black slaves were freed. But five days later, Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by an extremist Confederate supporter. In 1914, the First World War began in Europe. At the beginning, the United States didn't send soldiers on the battlefields. But in 1917, German submarines, called U-boats, from the German word Unterseeboot, sunk American cargo ships and other ships containing civilians passengers, like the Lusitania. Also, Germany sent a secret coded message, called the Zimmerman Telegram (from the sender Arthur Zimmermann) to Mexico, which suggested that the two countries could attack the USA. But English spies found the message and announced the attack to the United States. Many people were angry against Germany and wanted to send American soldiers in Europe to fight against Germany. After the First World War, the United States was one of the richest nations in the world. Cities like New York City and Washington, D.C. grew bigger, and new products were invented and exported to the rest of the world. In the US, new objects like cars were developed. Modern engines were needed and factories were created. For his Model-T car, Henry Ford even developed a new way of organising factory work. The USA exported lots of industrial objects and became richer. In the 1920s the Americans wanted to forget the war and have good time. African-Americans invented a new music called Jazz. Some women, called flappers, had their hair cut short. The 1920s is often known as the Jazz Age. In the 1920s, racism was still important in the US, and racist Americans called the Ku Klux Klan killed African-Americans illegally at night. They were dressed in white, and hooded for not being identified. The Ku-Klux-Klan would catch African-Americans, and then burn them on a cross. Some Americans thought that the problems came from the immigrants and labor leaders, whom they said were Bolsheviks (Russian Communists). Between 1920 and 1933, it was made illegal to drink alcohol. This was called the Prohibition. But some people still drank illegally alcohol in bars called speakeasies. Votes were organised against it. Some gangsters like Al Capone became very rich by selling illegally alcohol. In 1939, World War II began in Europe. At the time, the USA president was Franklin Roosevelt. He allied with the president of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, and the French general Charles De Gaulle, and together they bombed Germany and France (occupied by the Nazis). Some of the bombs launched by the Americans accidentally killed French people, and some French thought that the Americans were their enemies. The 7th December 1941, the Japanese Empire attacked an American port in Hawaii called Pearl Harbour. The Americans in England would also communicate to French resistant by writing secret messages and tying the paper to pigeons who would come in France and deliver it. In 1944, Roosevelt had a meeting at Moscow with the president Churchill and the soviet dictator Stalin. They organised a gigantic attack against the German Nazis. Firstly, in the bay of Biscay, the American army made fake soldiers with fake tanks and fake guns. On the London radio, it said when the D-Day would arrive by telling a song or a sentence so that a resistant in France could understand it. Then, the 6th June 1944, as the Germans sent its army on the bay of Biscay, 10,000 American soldiers arrived on the beaches of Normandy. This was called the D-Day. The German army quickly sent all its army in Normandy against the Americans. In passing, they destroyed two villages in southern France, killing everybody. A huge line of Nazi tanks went from southern France to Normandy. In Normandy, thousands of soldiers arrived by falling in parachute from aeroplanes or in boats. Slowly, the German army was pushed. The American Army took one month for gaining a few kilometres, but then they went faster and won against the Germans. Adolf Hitler, the German dictator, killed himself. In 1945, the Allies had won, but millions of people had died in the terrible war. However, Germany was allied with the Japanese Empire. The Americans launched two nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The two bombs killed thousands of Japanese civilians. At the end of the 2nd World War, the Americans had arrived in France and went up to Germany, while the Russians had passed by Poland. The two armies arrived almost at the same time at Berlin, and had together annihilated the Germans, but there was a problem: the USA was capitalist while the USSR was communist. The two huge and powerful countries began to be better than the other one. The term ""Cold War"" is used because the USA and Russia never directly fought each other. In 1945, after the Japanese occupation, Korea was divided in two parts: North Korea was for the USSR, and South Korea for the USA. Then, allied with China and Russia, North Korea (governed by Kim-Il Sung) decided to send 75,000 soldiers to attack South Korea in June 1950. The North Korean army pushed the South Korean army up to Busan. Then, the United States made war against Vietnam. During the Vietnam War, thousands of Vietnamese were killed and 10,000 hectares of plantations were destroyed. In 1969, Neil Armstrong, an astronaut, was sent on the moon. In the US, there was still racism. Black and white people were segregated (separated) in public areas such as buses. An American pastor, Martin Luther King, Jr. fought against racism. In 1963, a civil rights march was organised at Washington. This is where Martin Luther King made his most famous speech ""I have a dream"". But Martin Luther King was assassinated by James Earl Ray while standing on his balcony. The 11th September 2001, terrorists from al-Qaeda attacked the World Trade Center, and killed more than 2,000 people. In 2003, the American army invaded Iraq, and killed 100,000 people (including civilians). In 2008, Barack Obama was elected president of the USA: he was the first black president of the US, and was then re-elected in 2012. In 2016, Donald Trump, from the Republican party, became president, with Mike Pence as vice-president. They ran for re-election after a first term, but were defeated. Trump challenged the election results for miscounts in several states, but no flaws were proven anywhere. In 2020, Joe Biden, from the Democratic party, was elected president, with Kamala Harris as his vice-president. She is the first woman in that office, and the first person of color. ‌",Easy

"Greece (Hellenic Republic) is a country in southern Europe. It shares borders with Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania and Turkey. The capital city is Athens. Other big cities in Greece are Thessaloniki, Patras and Piraeus. Greece is well known for it's history and it's islands. The country is also a member of the European Union and uses the Euro as its currency along with 16 other countries in Europe. Greece is heir to the heritages of ancient Greece, the Romans and the Byzantine Empire, and nearly four hundred years of Ottoman rule. Greece is the birthplace of democracy, the Olympic Games, western books, and western theatre (see theatre of ancient Greece. The Iliad, an epic poem written by Homer in the 8th Century BC, is the oldest work of western writing. Ancient Greece was not a single country; Ancient Greece was divided into lots of small city-states in the south and two kingdoms in the north. Generally the south was much more advanced; Athens and Sparta, the most powerful Greek cities, were in the south. There were many wars between the cities, and it was not until 338 BC (338 'before Christ') when they were all united to fight against the Persians under King Philip II of Macedon, one of the two kingdoms of the north. When Philip died his son, Alexander the Great, took his place and campaigned against Persia, establishing a new era, the Hellenistic era. After the Hellenistic era, in 146 BC, the Roman period began when the Romans ruled over Greek lands. After a century the whole Greek-speaking world became part of the Roman Empire. Greek was the language used by most of the people in the eastern parts of the Empire, while Latin was spoken more in the west. In 330 AD the capital of the Roman Empire changed; Byzantium, an ancient Greek city, became the new capital, which was then renamed to Constantinople (in Greek: 'The city of Constantine' meaning the emperor who chose Byzantium as the new capital). In the following years the Roman Empire was divided into two parts; the east part became the Byzantine Empire. In 1453 the siege of Constantinople by the Turks took place, the Ottoman Empire was then established. For almost four centuries, Greece was part of the Ottoman Empire. In 5 March 1821 Greeks started a revolution so they could be independent. Greece became an independent country on 3 February 1830. Many wars occurred before Greece gained the lands it has today. Greece also took part in the two World Wars. Greece fought alongside the Allies in World War II and the Entente in World War I. A civil war took place after the World Wars, too. After a military junta of 1967–1974 a vote was held for Greeks to decide whether they wanted Greece to become a Republic or to remain a Kingdom. The Greek vote of December 8, 1974, resulted in the end of the monarchy in Greece and the establishment of the current Third Hellenic Republic. Greece became the tenth member of the European Union on January 1, 1981. The country adopted the Euro in 2001 and successfully organized the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. At the moment Greece is facing big economic and social problems. Four fifths of Greece consist of mountains or hills, making the country one of the most mountainous in Europe. The highest mountain in Greece is Olympus, the mythical house of the ancient Greek gods. Western Greece contains a number of lakes and wetlands. Greece has also many islands, over 6,000, the largest being Crete. Other well-known large islands are Rhodes, Santorini and Corfu. Greece is an active earthquake zone, small earthquakes occur every year in Greece, especially in Western and Southern Greece. Greece has a coastline of over 13,600 kilometres. Mount Olympus, at 2,917 metres, is the highest mountain in the country and is believed to be the home of the Greeks Gods in Greek Mythology. The climate of Greece can be categorized into three types: the Mediterranean, the Alpine and the Temperate. The Mediterranean type of climate features mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The Alpine type of climate features harsh winters with large snowfalls, while the summers are cool with many thunderstorms. This climate is to be found on high mountains. The Temperate type of climate features cold, damp winters and hot, dry summers. Greek Alphabet through the ages Greece's population is around 11 million. The majority of people living in the country are ethnic Greeks with some people from foreign countries like Albania and Bulgaria staying in the country at the moment. The most spoken language in Greece is Greek, as well as the official language of the state. But there are also people who speak Bulgarian and Turkish close to the borders with Bulgaria and Turkey. Greek language has a history of almost 4,000 years. English is widely spoken as a foreign language, along with other languages such as French, German, Italian and Spanish among others. These five languages are also provided around the country's schools. Education in Greece is required from the ages of 5 to 15. The majority of Greek people are Greek (Eastern) Orthodox (95%) and it is also the state religion. There are other Christian groups in Greece, too, the largest being Catholic Christians; the majority lives in the Cyclades and the Ionian Islands. The country's oldest religious minority is the Jewish community, however, it is no longer the largest non-Christian group. There are also some Muslims residing in the Northern Greek region of Thrace, close to the Turkish borders. Greek cuisine is a typical Mediterranean cuisine, similar to those of Italy, the Balkans, Turkey, and the Middle East. The majority of national foods are based around olive oil, vegetables and herbs, grains and bread, wine, fish, and various meats. Also important are olives, cheese, aubergine, courgette, and yoghurt. Greek desserts are characterized by the dominant use of nuts and honey. Greek salad is widely known around the globe. The most famous sport among Greeks is probably football. Greeks also tend to listen to foreign music a lot, while Greek music is famous in countries in the Balkans and the Middle East. Greece attracts more than 16 million tourists each year. Greece has been an attraction for international visitors for a long time because of its rich and long history and more recently for its glorious Mediterranean coastline and beaches. The most popular destinations for tourists are the Cyclades, Athens, Crete, Rhodes, the Ionian Islands, where the island of Corfu is, and other coastal regions of the country as well as places of archaeological interest.

Prior to European colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was a part of the Inca Empire — the largest State in pre-Columbian America. The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century. During most of the Spanish colonial period, this area was called upper Peru. After the proclamation of independence in 1809 followed 16 years of war before the Republic, named for Simón Bolívar, on August 6, 1825. Bolivia has struggled with periods of political instability, dictatorships and economic woes. Bolivia is a Democratic Republic. It is a developing country, with a medium human development index and a poverty level of 53%. The main economic activities include agriculture, forestry, fisheries, mining and the production of goods, such as textiles, clothing, refined metals, and refined petroleum products. Bolivia is very rich in minerals, particularly tin. The Bolivian population, estimated at 10 million, is multi ethnic, including Amerindians, mestizos, Europeans, and Africans. The spoken language is Spanish, although the Aymara, It is believed that the oldest inhabitants of Bolivia Indians are about 13000 years BC and date back to Around 1441 ad. Bolivia is governed by the Incas. Around 1545 South America was colonized by the Spaniards and, consequently, Bolivia. The nomadic Indians in the lowlands East of the Andes mountains, however, were never effectively subdued by the Spanish. After the Bolivian war of independence was on 6 August 1825 independence declared the ""República de Bolívar"" (named after the freedom fighter Simón Bolívar). Since then, the country ravaged by wars and coups. In 1867 Bolivia with Brazil swapped parts of the Mato Grosso and Acre for the free passage on the Madeira, a major tributary of the Amazon River. This Bolivia obtained an exit to the Atlantic Ocean. In 1903, the rest of Acre, when an important rubber area, its independence and joined Brazil. In 1884, together with Peru Bolivia lost the war of the Pacific by Chile. As a result, the country had to cede the coastal province Litoral (now the Antofagasta region). Bolivia got cut off from the Pacific Ocean, making the Bolivian Navy since then on the Peruvian side of Lake Titicaca exerts. From 1932 to 1935 was at war with neighboring Bolivia Paraguay. This Chaco War was due to the possible find of oil on the Chaco Boreal, a large sparsely populated Savannah. More than 80,000 Bolivians lost life, partly due to a poor organization and outbreak of diseases and lack of water in the very arid area. Paraguay eventually conquered large areas on Bolivia. In 1952 a revolution took place. Indians had no civil rights, but the revolution gave their first right to participate. The Tin mines were nationalized and agricultural land redistributed. Presidents Hernán Siles Zuazo and the Víctor Paz Estenssoro held the Communists outside the door and kept the support of Washington. In 1964 took command of the army. On October 8, 1967, was Che Guevara picked up during a CIA-organized military operation by the Bolivian army. Guevara was executed by the Bolivian army. In 1982 the military power is transferred to a civilian Government. The tensions between the country and Chile came back reflected at the Bolivian gas conflict in 2003.

"Gelato is a frozen dessert containing milk, sugar, egg yolk, flavoring and air. Its name means “frozen” in Italian, but refers to ice cream. It is thought that gelato was invented during the 16th and 18th centuries in Paris, by the architect Bernardo Buontalenti. He had adapted the existing sorbet recipe by adding egg yolks, sugar and milk to make gelato. Shortly after its creation, gelato was introduced to the court of the French queen Catherine de Medici, where it was well received. Following this, an Italian chef Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli started selling gelato in his Parisian cafe, therefore spreading the creation to the masses. Over time, gelato began to appear on menus and in cookbooks. The invention of artificial ice allowed street vendors to start selling gelato, and the cone was created to make eating and distributing the portions easier. Starting from the 1900s, shops specialising in gelato were set up. Advancements in science after World War II led to the creation of sophisticated freezers, mixers, and pasteurisers which assured food safety and quality. The status of gelato vendors as artisans today is because of the artistic flair added to the selling and display of gelato, making its trade a novelty in the process. Gelato is made with milk, sugar, egg yolks, flavoring, and mixed with less air as compared to traditional ice cream, which contains additional full cream. Because the gelato mix does not use so much air, it has a more intense flavor than ice cream, and has lower levels of fat. Sorbet on the other hand is completely fat free, made with the same process as ice cream but using only sugar, flavoring and water. Despite this, it usually has a high sugar content. There are a wide variety of gelato flavors to choose from, and names of flavors vary for every company. Traditional or “classic” flavors include crema (original “unflavored” gelato), gianduja (chocolate with hazelnut) and vanilla. Some special flavors use unusual ingredients such as black tea leaves, coconut, banana and cardamom. There is even gelato like the caffè espresso (made with freshly brewed espressos) and créme fraîche (similar to cheesecake). Gelato flavors are limited to the artisan’s imagination and creativity. Seen as a healthier or higher-quality alternative, gelato is gaining more and more popularity as an artisanal ice cream. With 9.4% of the ice cream market being made up of gelato sales, it is expected to grow even more in the coming years. To make vanilla gelato, use one and a half cups of milk, one cup of sugar, and one split vanilla bean. Combine the milk and sugar in a saucepan, and cook until it comes to a simmer before removing from the heat. After this, add vanilla seeds to the milk, followed by the bean pod, and allow the mixture to sit for thirty minutes. Strain this into another bowl, discarding the vanilla seeds and pod. Cover the bowl and place it in a refrigerator for at least two hours or overnight. Remove the gelato mix and place it into an ice cream maker, freezing it according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",Easy

"Pollution is when something is added to the environment that is harmful or poisonous to people, animals, and other living things. Smoke in the air from factories is a type of pollution as it is bad for the lungs when breathed in. Sewage in drinking water is another type of pollution, as it can make people unwell because it contains germs and viruses. People living next to a building site where there is too much noise can become sick as they cannot sleep or relax. This is called noise pollution. Air pollution is caused by harmful gases such as carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide and very small particles of carbon. Most of the pollution is caused by factories, vehicles and livestock. Today air pollution has become a great threat to human life. People face breathing problems like asthma due to poll. Water pollution is the presence of harmful materials in water, such as sewage, dissolved metals, waste from farms and factories and crude oil spilled from shipwrecked tankers. The three main substances that pollute water are nitrates from fertilisers, sewage, and detergents. Pollution causes harm to organisms living in water and can also harm people's health, and can cause problems such as cancer.

"Egyptian pyramids are tombs built in the geometric shape of pyramids. They were built by pharaohs in ancient Egypt. The pyramids are one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. They oldest, and the only ones that have resisted through until now the effects of time and earthquakes. The Pyramids of Giza are the best known because they are the largest, the most complete and the best conserved today, but other pyramids were built before and after them. We can note the technical evolution of the pyramids over the centuries. Before the pyramids, the graves of the pharaohs and of high characters were mastabas, large square tombs covering cellars and funerary chambers. The first pyramids, those of the Third Dynasty were step pyramids made of several stacked mastabas, forming gigantic steps drawn up towards the sky. Then the Kings of the Fourth Dynasty made pyramids with smooth faces, which became objects of perfect geometrical form, henceforth and for a long time the tallest and the largest constructions built by man. The pyramids of Egypt are situated on the long desert limestone plateau which stretches above the left bank of the Nile. Stepped pyramid of Djoser. The most ancient site is that of Saqqarah, which dominates the ancient city of Memphis, capital of Lower Egypt, a little south of the current city of Cairo. The first pyramid is that of King Djeser (or Djoser), of the Third Dynasty who ruled before 2800 BCE. At first a simple mastaba, it was subjected to a succession of expansions and elevations, until becoming an immense monument of 109 x 121 meters, with a height of 62 meters It contains a huge central cellar and a network of corridors, (some decorated with a green earthenware tile), leading to rooms and funerary storerooms. Step pyramid of Sekhemkhet. Sekhemkhet, Djeser's successor didn't have the time to make his own step pyramid, predicted to reach a height of about 70 metres above a base of 120 x 120 metres. Several portions of foundation remain, just reaching about ten meters. A large complex of corridors and well conserved underground storerooms, leads to central burial chamber. Maidum Pyramid (kings Huni and Snefru) The Pyramid situated close to Meidoum, at the entrance of the large irrigated plain of Fayoum, resembles from a distance a huge ice cream halfway melted. This pyramid, by its halfway collapsed state reveals to us all its structure: there is no doubt, the Pharaohs and their architects had an unlimited taste for experimentation! King Houni, (Third Dynasty, reigning near 2600 - 2575 BCE) begins the construction for a henceforth classical step pyramid, finishing it then increasing the volume by the addition of ""slices"" arranged at an angle on the four faces. Not content with the feat, his successor Snefrou (Fourth Dynasty, reigning from around 2575 BCE) realized an entirely new idea: he dresses the great step pyramid with a lining carefully laid on the sides of the walls. Giving the monument the aspect of a pyramid with smooth faces with a base of 144 meters and a height of 92 metres. The angle of this smooth pyramid is 51 degrees, that is to say very steep. The most likely hypothesis is that this pyramid collapsed when it was completed or about to be. It can be distinguished in the diagram and the photo caption, how much of the building owned visible elements or refurbished parts correspond to the outer walls, while the rumble strips were originally concealed parties. A ramp leads to several rooms, two of which have been discovered recently, around 2000, by the French architect Gilles Dormion. Partie lisse de la pyramide de Meïdoum Schéma des trois états successifs de la pyramide de Meïdoum Éléments visibles des trois phases de la construction The irregular or rhomboidal pyramid at Dahshur (just south of Gaza) is also attributed to Snefru. It marks an important step in the development of the pyramids' architecture sometimes it has a smooth limestone surface and two rooms connected by a narrow casing, but each filled in a descending passage The northern descending passage leads to an underground chamber, while the second descending passage on the west - configuration not found elsewhere - leads to another room above the other, in the masonry itself.

Salvagers had begun to remove the stones from one corner of the pyramid, thus revealing the crude, cheaply done, internal masonry. From the outside, this pyramid looks like the best preserved of all, but inside, the entrances, situated at staggering heights, lead to cracked and sagging descending corridors that do not inspire confidence. The rooms are greatly damaged, halfway filled in and supported by struts, probably since their creation. The dimensions are ambitious: 189 m at the base, 104 m in height, with slopes of 54, then 43 degrees. It is accepted that the change in slope was decided following the internal collapse of rooms and tunnels. After final calculations, the pyramid was judged useless by the pharaoh, who then had to build a third... Red Pyramid (Sneferu) Unlike the previous two, Snefru's architects seemed to have played it safe for this third pyramid which, probably, satisfied him enough finally to establish his burial chamber there. For all his three pyramids together, Snefru moved no less than 3.3 million cubic meters of stone, which most certainly makes it the largest architectural project in the entire history of mankind. Cross-section of the Pyramid of Cheops The Giza Plateau, north of the previous sites, dominates the modern city of Cairo. it is one of the three famous of the XXVI century The Pyramid of Cheops (Khufu in the language of the Egyptians), built around -2560, is the most massive (base 230 m) and the highest of all (146 m).

The Great Pyramid was entirely covered in a coating of fine polished limestone, of which there remains only the first layer. The rest, removed with the aid of levers and restored by quarrymen, has been used since the Middle Ages in the construction of monuments in Cairo. However, one has several doubts on the architectural success of this assembly, if one considers that the funerary chamber of the King, the final goal of the operation, is gravely and irredimably cracked under the weight, very probably in the concluding phase of the monument.

Pyramide de Chéops Grande galerie de Chéops «Chambre du roi» The second pyramid, built around 2540 BCE., is that of Chephren (Khafre, in the language of the Egyptians). It's almost as big as it's predecessor with a base of 215 meters, it reaches a height of 143 meters, with a very accentuated slope of 53 degrees, in a ratio of 43. It retains, at its summit, a good part of its polished limestone surface, clearly showing how the stone facing, suspended overhead, is locked to the mass of masonry. The interior arrangements include a chamber flush with the ground, and another underground. They are of a modest appearance, corresponding so little to the Pharaonic splendour, that one has always suspected the existence of other chambers, never discovered. The tunnels, made deep in the mass of the pyramid, testify to this very ancient conviction. Le sphinx, devant la pyramide de Chéphren. Sommet de la pyramide, avec le parement conservé. Temple de la vallée, de Chéphren. The Spinx of Giza watches over the funerary complex of Chephren. But it may as well see its origin reaching back to the work of Cheops, or even an earlier epoch. The lost sarcophagus of Mykerinos - The pyramid of Mykerinos (Monkaoure, in the language of the Egyptians), dates from around 2520 BCE. It is the smallest of the three pyramids of Giza, with half of the dimensions of its two predecessors: a base of 105 meters, and a height of 65 meters. The angle is 51 degrees, according to the ratio of 1411. They say that the volume of this pyramid represents hardly a tenth of its neighbors: a good exercise is to check it out! The pyramid has kept, at the base, a well established Aswan granite surface, not refaced. We also know that the tallest part of the monument was very simply covered with thin limestone. We think that this incompleteness is due to the premature death of the King. Pyramide de Mykérinos Partie conservée du revêtement de granite Chambre funéraire de Mykérinos Found along the left bank of the Nile are around 80 pyramids, all of which are tombs of the Kings and the dignitaries of ancient Egypt.

But these more recent pyramids, even if their distribution and their interior decoration are of great interest, resemble shapeless hills or mounds of ruins, or even, more often heaps of sand and pebbles.

"The Amazon River (also named Rio Amazonas in Portuguese and Spanish) is a river that flows in South America.The source of the Amazon is in the Andes Mountains of western South America. It flows east from there to the Atlantic Ocean. Most of the huge river and its many tributaries are in Brazil. This river is the biggest by the amount of water it carries. It moves more water than the next eight rivers by amount put together. Amazon has the largest drainage basin in the world. It accounts for about one-fifth of the world's total river flow. During the wet season parts of the Amazon exceed 120 miles(190 km) in width. Because of its size, it is sometimes called The River Sea. It is one of the longest rivers in the world. There are different studies, that tried to measure its length. It is therefore difficult to say which of these rivers is really the Amazon. Also note that during the rainy season, the length of the river changes. Several studies from Brazil, Spain and Chile say it is the longest river in the world, longer than the Nile. The Nile has a length of 6,571km. The Amazon may have a length of 6,218 kilometers. The Spanish daily newspaper El País gives its length at 6.850 kilometers. In 2007, scientists from Peru and Brazil calculated a length of 6,800 km. A study done in 1969 says that the Amazon has a length of 6,448 km. This was measured from a part of the River Apurimac. Until the 1970s, it was thought that the Marañón River was the source of the Amazon. In 2001, an expedition found that Nevado Mismi was, in fact, the source of the Amazon. There are many places on the Amazon where a person on one side of the river cannot see the other side. The Brazilians call the Amazon the ""River Sea."" The estuary of the Amazon is about 205 miles (330km) wide. The width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo do Norte to Punto Patijoca. Generally, the outlet of the Para River is included. It is 37 miles (60km) wide and forms the estuary of the Tocantins. The estuary also includes the island of Marajó, which lies in the mouth of the Amazon. This means that the Amazon is wider at its mouth than the entire length of the Thames in England. Along the coastline, near Cabo do Norte, there are many islands partially covered with water. There are also sandbanks. The tides of the Atlantic generate a wave that reaches into the Amazon river. This wave goes along the coast for about 99 miles (160 km). The phenomenon of this wave generated by the tides is called tidal bore. Locally it is known as pororoca. The pororoca occurs where the water is less than 23ft (7m) deep. It starts with a loud noise and advances at a speed of 9–16 mph (15-25 kmh). The bore is the reason the Amazon does not have a delta. The ocean rapidly carries away a large amount of silt brought by the Amazon. This makes it impossible for a delta to grow past the shoreline. It also has a very large tide, that can reach 20ft (6m). The place has become popular for river surfing. A phenomenon that is very similar occurs at the mouth of the Orinoco. No bridges have been built over the Amazon. This is not because the river would be too wide to bridge. For most of its length, engineers could build a bridge across the river easily. For most of its course, the river flows through tropical rainforest, there are very few roads and cities. Most of the time, the crossing can be done by a ferry, there is no need to build a bridge. The river is the main route of traffic in the region. Big ocean ships can get up the river until Manaus, which is almost 1500 kilometers from its mouth. Smaller ocean ships of 3,000 tons and 7.9m (26ft) draft can reach as far as Iquitos in Peru, 2,300 miles (3,700 km) from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach 780km (486mi) higher as far as Actual Point. Beyond that, small boats frequently go up to the Pogo Ode Escherichia's, just above Actual Point. Most cities lie on the banks of the river. The biggest city on the river is Manaus, which is also the capital of the Brazillian State of Amazonas.

"Martha Washington (June 2, 1731 – May 2, 1802) was the wife of George Washington, the first president of the United States of America. She was the first First Lady of the United States. Washington was born Martha Dandridge on Chestnut Grove Plantation, New Kent County, Virginia, and died at Mount Vernon. At 18, she married Daniel Parke Custis, a tobacco planter 20 years older than she. She bore him four children. Only two, John ""Jacky"" and Martha ""Patsy"", survived to young adulthood. She was widowed in 1757 at age 26. In 1759, she married George Washington, a colonel in the British army. Their marriage was one of mutual affection and respect, but not one of passion. The Washingtons had no biological children. During the American Revolutionary War, Washington provided food and clothing to the American troops, and urged other colonial women to do the same. The veterans loved her and addressed her as ""Lady Washington"". George Washington was unanimously elected president in 1789. Martha served as First Lady from April 30, 1789 to March 4, 1797. She found the job unpleasant. She complained of the journalists who followed her everywhere and of the many restrictions placed upon her as First Lady (she was not allowed to accept dinner invitations, for example). She died in Mount Vernon on May 22, 1802. Her obituary (death notice) was widely printed in regional newspapers. She is buried in the vault at Mount Vernon. She was the first historical female figure to be depicted by the United States government on postage stamps and currency.",Easy

"Santa Claus is a fictional Christmas character. He is loosely based on St. Nicholas, the patron saint of children. Santa Claus is an elf who lives at the North Pole. He makes toys for children. He rides through the sky on Christmas Eve in a sleigh drawn by reindeer. He lands on the roof of a house in his sleigh, then drops down the chimney. He leaves toys for all the children in the house under the Christmas tree and in their Christmas stockings. Over the years, many customs have grown up around Santa Claus. For instance, children write letters to Santa and mail them to his workshop at the North Pole. They leave cookies and milk for him on Christmas Eve, and carrots for his reindeer. In some places, children go to department stores to tell one of ""Santa's helpers"" what toys they want for Christmas. Santa Claus is a character in stories and poems such as The Night Before Christmas by Clement Clarke Moore, The Story of Santa Claus by L. Frank Baum, and the editorial ""Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus"". There are many songs about Santa Claus like ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" and ""Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer"".

"A sign language is a language made of positions and movements of hands, head and body combined with facial expressions. They are primarily used among deaf people. Sign languages are used all over the world, yet they are not the same everywhere. Just as there are many spoken languages, there are many signed languages. Sign languages developed over time among local deaf communities across the world, being influenced by their respective environments and cultures. They are no direct bound to oral languages: signed languages have their own history. For example, American Sign Language is much closer to French Sign Language than it is to British Sign Language! And the Flemish Sign Language, used in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, is derived from the French Sign Language and has nothing to do with the Dutch Sign Language. However, someone that communicates using American sign language would usually read and write written English. Where official sign languages are not known (and even where they are), ""home sign"" typically develops where speakers needs it to communicate. In addition to local sign languages, there is one called International Sign which is used in some international gatherings of deaf people as well as when travelling. Contrarily to the local languages, this one has been artificially constructed since the second half of the XXth century. It uses a quite limited basic vocabulary, complemented with grammatical features common to most sign languages such as classifiers. Also, since sign languages tend to mix a lot of miming and acting along with the actual language, deaf people often have an easier time making themselves understood with other deaf people, even if they don't ""speak"" the same language. This also helps them to learn each other's languages. So deaf people might have an easier time communicating across the language barrier even if their respective languages are very different. Deaf people sometimes learn a sign language from their family, especially if their parents are deaf. But, most deaf children have hearing parents, so they learn a sign language from other deaf people. They may learn it by going to signing classes or by meeting deaf people otherwise or studying it alone with a workbook, or interactive method. Other people learn sign language in order to be able to communicate easily with family members or friends that are deaf or hard of hearing. Sign languages may also be learned in order to be a sign language interpreter. For hearing people, learning a sign language is really like learning a second language, not just learning signs for the words you already know. In the same way, translating a sign language to a spoken language involves accounting for grammar differences in much the same way that translating from one spoken language to another does.",Easy

The day is observed by the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Lutheran Church, and people of Irish descent around the world. Not much is known about St Patrick. He was born in Roman Britain to a wealthy family in the 5th century. Patrick was 16 years old when he was captured by Irish raiders and taken into Ireland. He escaped after six years of slavery, and returned to Britain. In later years, he went back to Ireland to teach and Christianize the Irish at great risk to his personal safety. He used a shamrock to teach the concept of the Trinity. Legend says he drove the snakes out of Ireland. St. Patrick died on 17 March. He is said to be buried at Down Cathedral in Downpatrick, County Down. In places where the day is observed, people attend mass, then turn the day over to celebrating and feasting. Most Irish people wear something green on the day like a tie, hair ribbon, or shamrock. The phrase ""the wearing of the green"" means to wear a shamrock on one's clothing. New York City, Boston, Dublin, and many other places have parades with a local celebrity (such as the police chief or mayor) acting as Grand Marshal.

"Ancient Rome is the name for a civilization which began as a small farming community in the 10th century BC Italy. It grew to become the largest empire in the ancient world. It started as a monarchy, then became a republic, then an empire. The Roman Empire was so big that there were problems ruling a territory which stretched from Britain to the Middle East. In 293 AD, Diocletian split the empire into two parts. A century later, in 395 AD, it was permanently split into the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire. The Western Empire ended because of the Germanic tribe, the Visigoths in 476 AD. In the 5th century AD, the western part of the empire split up into different kingdoms. The eastern Roman Empire stayed together as the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantine Empire would be defeated by the Ottoman Empire in 1453. Roman culture spread to Western Europe and the area around the Mediterranean Sea. Its history still has a big influence on the world today. For example, Roman ideas about laws, government, art, literature, and language are important to European culture. The Roman language, Latin, slowly evolved becoming modern French, Spanish, Italian, and Romanian, and influenced many other languages like English. Beginning with Emperor Nero in the first century AD, the Roman government did not like Christianity. At some points, people could be put to death because they were Christians. Under Emperor Diocletian, the persecution of Christians because the strongest. However, Christianity became an officially supported religion in the Roman Empire under Constantine I, who was the next Emperor. With the signing of the Edict of Milan in 313, it quickly became the biggest religion. All religions except Christianity were banned in 391 AD by an edict of Emperor Theodosius I. The Byzantines were threatened by the rise of Islam, whose followers took over the territories of Syria, Armenia and Egypt and soon threatened to take over Constantinople. In the next century, the Arabs also captured southern Italy and Sicily. The Byzantines, however, managed to stop Islamic invader from moving further into their lands during the 8th century and, beginning in the 9th century, took parts of the conquered lands back over. In 1000 AD, the Eastern Empire was at its largest point: Basileios II reconquered Bulgaria and Armenia, culture and trade flourished. However, the expansion was suddenly stopped in 1071 at the Battle of Manzikert. This finally made the empire start becoming weaker. Several centuries of fighting and Turkic invasions ultimately made it possible for Emperor Alexius I Comnenus to send a call for help to the West in 1095. The West responded with the Crusades, eventually resulting in the Sack of Constantinople by participants in the Fourth Crusade. The conquest of Constantinople in 1204 split what little land remained in the Empire into new countries, the ultimate winner being Nicaea. After the recapture of Constantinople by Imperial forces, the empire was little more than a Greek state confined to the Aegean coast. The Eastern Empire came to an end when Mehmed II conquered Constantinople on 29 May 1453.",Easy
"Jane Austen (Steventon, 16 December 1775 – Winchester, 18 July 1817) is one of the most famous writers of English literature. Her books are well-known all over the world. Jane Austen wrote about the English upper class and in her books are critical comments about this class. Among her most popular books are Pride and Prejudice (1813) and Emma (1815). Jane Austen grew up in a close-knit family and was a member of the lower English aristocracy. Her father taught her and her brothers mostly. She learned a lot by reading too. Her family supported her writing talent. Meanwhile, most readers read the so-called sentimental novels. She was very critical about them and developed her own writing style. Austen's novels became the transition to the more realistic ones of the nineteenth century. In her novels Austen was very critical about the position of women. At that time women were dependent on a good marriage to secure their social standing and economic security. English law was restrictive of women's rights. For example, the daughters of a man without sons could not inherit family property, which would go to a close male relative such as a cousin. Austen chose to publish her books anonymously. Although the critics were favorable, she was never recognized as the author of those books. It was not until the second half of the twentieth century that she became well-known, more than a hundred years after her dead.",Easy

"The Portuguese language is the official language of Portugal. In Portuguese, Portuguese is português. The language is spoke by about 215 million people. The Portuguese language uses the Latin alphabet now with the letters k, w, and y. They use six different diacritics to change the sounds that the letters make in words. Here are the different letters that are changed by diacritics: á, â, ã, à, ç, é, ê, í, ó, ô, õ, ú, . About two hundred and fifty million people speak Portuguese as their native language. It is the 5th most spoken language of the world. It is one of the official languages of the European Union and Mercosul. Portuguese is spoken all over the world. Most people in Portugal and Brazil speak Portuguese as their first language. It is the official language of Portugal, Brazil, East Timor, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe, Mozambique and Equatorial Guinea. A few hundred years ago Portugal discovered, colonized and laid claim to many regions around the world. Portuguese colonization was distinct from other colonizing nations due to the small size of the nation (territorypopulation). The colonization process was a direct result of nautical exploration for commerce and trade routes and the goal to establish claims (see Padrão), more than a pressure to expand population. A significative part of the population necessary to maintain the new territorial claims were in fact not even of Portuguese origin, Galegos (from Galicia - Spain) and Flemengos (Flemish people) were, especially in the earlier stages of expansion, of great importance to the crown. For similar reasons there was also a great level of interbreeding with locals and population movement from colony to colony, more than any other European nation. As can be seen above the Portuguese Empire (Império Ultramarino, overseas empire) included Brazil, countries in Africa, Asia, and Oceania. It was the longest-lived modern European colonial empire and the first global empire in history. Portuguese settlers (and settlers from other nations under license from Portugal) went to the new colonies, established the government and business, ruling over any existing indigenous populations. The new colonies continued to speak Portuguese and indigenous were required to learn the language in order to interact with the state representatives. Portuguese was often established as a common language on ethnically distinct regions that have several local dialects (i.e.: Angola and Guinea-Bissau) and this practice continues after their independence or as a way to preserve Historico-cultural distinction like in East Timor. Although Portuguese is not the official language in Goa and Macao it is still spoken by minorities on those regions and the language also had a deep influence in nations that it entered in contact, for instance Portuguese were the first Europeans to reach Japan and one of the many legacies was the adoption of some Portuguese language into Japanese. The spoken language of Galiza, an autonomous community in northwest Spain, is Galician language (Galego), closely related to Portuguese. (In medieval times, Galego and Portuguese were a single language.) Portuguese-speaking African countries (PALOP) formed by Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique and São Tomé and Príncipe and Equatorial Guinea, part of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP) an the intergovernmental organization for friendship among lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) nations where Portuguese is an official language. There are also large communities of Portuguese speaking people in other parts of the world such as the United States, Andorra, France, Luxembourg, Jersey, Venezuela, and South Africa. Portuguese is becoming one of the main languages in Southern Africa, where it is also taught in Namibia and South Africa. Portuguese-based Creole is also spoken in different parts of the world. These include India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Portuguese is one of the romance languages, which means it is one of many descendants of Latin (Ibero-Roman group). All of these languages split from Latin long ago. During the Middle Ages the Latin in North Portugal and Galicia (northwestern Spain) slowly became a language called Galician-Portuguese. Galician-Portuguese was a mix of Latin and some of the local pré-Roman languages: Celt, Lusitanian. It also contains influences from the invaders of the Roman Empire: Vandals, Visigoths and later Arabic invaders from northern Africa (the Moors), even French due to cultural relations and English due to economical relations have enriched the language. The discoveries age enriched Portuguese language by giving lots of words from Africa, Asia and America.

"Muhi-ud-Din Muhammad (3 November 1618 – 3 March 1707), commonly known by the sobriquet Aurangzeb (Persian: ""Ornament of the Throne"") or by his regnal title Alamgir (Persian: ""Conqueror of the World""), was the sixth Mughal emperor, who ruled over almost the entire Indian subcontinent for a period of 49 years. Widely considered to be the last effective ruler of the Mughal Empire, Aurangzeb compiled the Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, and was among the few monarchs to have fully established Sharia law and Islamic economics throughout the Indian subcontinent. He was an accomplished military leader whose rule has been the subject of praise, though he has also been described as the most controversial ruler in Indian history. He was a notable expansionist; during his reign, the Mughal Empire reached its greatest extent, ruling over nearly all of the Indian subcontinent.During his lifetime, victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to 4million square kilometres,and he ruled over a population estimated to be over 158 million subjects,Under his reign, India surpassedQing Chinato become the world's largest economy and biggest manufacturing power, worth nearly a quarter ofglobal GDPand more than the entirety of Western Europe, and its largest and wealthiest subdivision, theBengal Subah,signaled theproto-industrialization. Aurangzeb was noted for his religious piety; hememorized the entire Quran, studiedhadithsand stringently observed the rituals of Islam.Unlike his predecessors, including his fatherShah Jahan, Aurangzeb considered the royal treasury to be held in trust for the citizens of his empire. He did not enjoy a luxurious life and his personal expenses and constructions of small mosques were covered by his own earnings, which included the sewing of caps and trade of his written copies of the Quran.He also patronized works ofIslamicandArabic calligraphy. Aurangzeb has been subject to criticism. Critics argue that his policies abandoned his predecessors' legacy of pluralism and religious tolerance, citing his introduction of thejizyatax and other policies based onIslamic ethics, demolition ofHindu temples, the executions of his elder brotherDara Shikoh,MarathakingSambhajiand the SikhGuru Tegh Bahadur,and the prohibition and supervision of behaviour and activities that areforbidden in Islamsuch as gambling, fornication, and consumption of alcohol and narcotics.Some historians question the historicity of the claims of his critics, arguing that his destruction of temples has been exaggerated,and noting that he also built temples,paid for their maintenance, employed significantly more Hindus in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors did, and opposed bigotry against Hindus andShia Muslims. Aurangzeb was born on 3 November 1618, in Dahod, Gujarat. He was the third son and sixth child of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal. In June 1626, after an unsuccessful rebellion by his father, Aurangzeb and his brother Dara Shukoh were kept as hostages under their grandparents' (Nur Jahan and Jahangir) Lahore court. On 26 February 1628, Shah Jahan was officially declared the Mughal Emperor, and Aurangzeb returned to live with his parents at Agra Fort, where Aurangzeb received his formal education in Arabic and Persian. His daily allowance was fixed at Rs. 500, which he spent on religious education and the study of history. On 28 May 1633, Aurangzeb escaped death when a powerful war elephant stampeded through the Mughal Imperial encampment. He rode against the elephant and struck its trunk with a lance, and successfully defended himself from being crushed. Aurangzeb's valour was appreciated by his father who conferred him the title of Bahadur (Brave) and had him weighed in gold and presented gifts worth Rs. 200,000. This event was celebrated in Persian and Urdu verses, and Aurangzeb said: If the (elephant) fight had ended fatally for me, it would not have been a matter of shame. Death drops the curtain even on Emperors; it is no dishonor. The shame lay in what my brothers did! TheMughal Armyunder the command of Aurangzeb recapturesOrchhain October 1635. Aurangzeb was nominally in charge of the force sent toBundelkhandwith the intent of subduing the rebellious ruler ofOrchha,Jhujhar Singh, who had attacked another territory in defiance of Shah Jahan's policy and was refusing to atone for his actions. By arrangement, Aurangzeb stayed in the rear, away from the fighting, and took the advice of his generals as theMughal Armygathered and commenced the Siege of Orchha in 1635. The campaign was successful and Singh was removed from power. Aurangzeb was appointed viceroy of the Deccan in 1636. After Shah Jahan's vassals had been devastated by the alarming expansion of Ahmednagar during the reign of the Nizam Shahi boy-prince Murtaza Shah III, the emperor dispatched Aurangzeb, who in 1636 brought the Nizam Shahi dynasty to an end. In 1637, Aurangzeb married the Safavid princess Dilras Banu Begum, posthumously known as Rabia-ud-Daurani. She was his first wife and chief consort as well as his favourite. He also had an infatuation with a slave girl, Hira Bai, whose death at a young age greatly affected him. In his old age, he was under the charms of his concubine, Udaipuri Bai. The latter had formerly been a companion to Dara Shukoh. In the same year, 1637, Aurangzeb was placed in charge of annexing the small Rajput kingdom of Baglana, which he did with ease. In 1644, Aurangzeb's sister,Jahanara, was burned when the chemicals in her perfume were ignited by a nearby lamp while inAgra. This event precipitated a family crisis with political consequences. Aurangzeb suffered his father's displeasure by not returning to Agra immediately but rather three weeks later. Shah Jahan had been nursing Jahanara back to health in that time and thousands of vassals had arrived in Agra to pay their respects.Shah Jahan was outraged to see Aurangzeb enter the interior palace compound in military attire and immediately dismissed him from his position of viceroy of the Deccan; Aurangzeb was also no longer allowed to use red tents or to associate himself with the official military standard of the Mughal emperor.Other sources tell us that Aurangzeb was dismissed from his position because Aurangzeb left the life of luxury and became a Faqir. In 1645, he was barred from the court for seven months and mentioned his grief to fellow Mughal commanders. Thereafter, Shah Jahan appointed him governor of Gujarat where he served well and was rewarded for bringing stability. In 1647, Shah Jahan moved Aurangzeb from Gujarat to be governor ofBalkh, replacing a younger son,Murad Baksh, who had proved ineffective there. The area was under attack fromUzbekandTurkmentribes. While the Mughal artillery and muskets were a formidable force, so too were the skirmishing skills of their opponents. The two sides were in stalemate and Aurangzeb discovered that his army could not live off the land, which was devastated by war. With the onset of winter, he and his father had to make a largely unsatisfactory deal with the Uzbeks, giving away territory in exchange for nominal recognition of Mughal sovereignty. The Mughal force suffered still further with attacks by Uzbeks and other tribesmen as it retreated through the snow toKabul. By the end of this two-year campaign, into which Aurangzeb had been plunged at a late stage, a vast sum of money had been expended for little gain. Further inauspicious military involvements followed, as Aurangzeb was appointed governor ofMultanandSindh. His efforts in 1649 and 1652 todislodgethe Safavids atKandahar, which they had recently retaken after a decade of Mughal control, both ended in failure as winter approached. The logistical problems of supplying an army at the extremity of the empire, combined with the poor quality of armaments and the intransigence of the opposition have been cited by John Richards as the reasons for failure, and a third attempt in 1653, led by Dara Shikoh, met with the same outcome. Aurangzeb became viceroy of the Deccan again after he was replaced by Dara Shukoh in the attempt to recapture Kandahar. Aurangzeb regretted this and harboured feelings that Shikoh had manipulated the situation to serve his own ends. Aurangbad's twojagirs(land grants) were moved there as a consequence of his return and, because the Deccan was a relatively impoverished area, this caused him to lose out financially. So poor was the area that grants were required fromMalwaand Gujarat in order to maintain the administration and the situation caused ill-feeling between father and son. Shah Jahan insisted that things could be improved if Aurangzeb made efforts to develop cultivation.Aurangzeb appointed Murshid Quli Khanto extend to the Deccan thezabtrevenue system used in northern India. Murshid Quli Khan organised a survey of agricultural land and a tax assessment on what it produced. To increase revenue, Murshid Quli Khan granted loans for seed, livestock, and irrigation infrastructure. The Deccan returned to prosperity, Aurangzeb proposed to resolve the situation by attacking the dynastic occupants ofGolconda(theQutb Shahis) andBijapur(theAdil Shahis). As an adjunct to resolving the financial difficulties, the proposal would also extend Mughal influence by accruing more lands.Aurangzeb advanced against the Sultan of Bijapur andbesieged Bidar. TheKiladar(governor or captain) of the fortified city, Sidi Marjan, was mortally wounded when a gunpowder magazine exploded. After twenty-seven days of hard fighting,Bidarwas captured by the Mughals and Aurangzeb continued his advance.Again, he was to feel that Dara had exerted influence on his father: believing that he was on the verge of victory in both instances, Aurangzeb was frustrated that Shah Jahan chose then to settle for negotiations with the opposing forces rather than pushing for complete victory. The four sons of Shah Jahan all held governorships during their father's reign. The emperor favoured the eldest,Dara Shukoh.This had caused resentment among the younger three, who sought at various times to strengthen alliances between themselves and against Dara. There was no Mughal tradition ofprimogeniture, the systematic passing of rule, upon an emperor's death, to his eldest son.Instead it was customary for sons to overthrow their father and for brothers to war to the death among themselves.HistorianSatish Chandrasays that ""In the ultimate resort, connections among the powerful military leaders, and military strength and capacity  the real arbiters"".The contest for power was primarily between Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb because, although all four sons had demonstrated competence in their official roles, it was around these two that the supporting cast of officials and other influential people mostly circulated.There were ideological differences— Dara was an intellectual and a religious liberal in the mould of Akbar, while Aurangzeb was much more conservative—but, as historiansBarbara D. MetcalfandThomas R. Metcalfsay, ""To focus on divergent philosophies neglects the fact that Dara was a poor general and leader. It also ignores the fact that factional lines in the succession dispute were not, by and large, shaped by ideology.""Marc Gaborieau, professor of Indian studies at l'École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales,explains that ""The loyalties of  seem to have been motivated more by their own interests, the closeness of the family relation and above all the charisma of the pretenders than by ideological divides.""Muslims and Hindus did not divide along religious lines in their support for one pretender or the other nor, according to Chandra, is there much evidence to support the belief that Jahanara and other members of the royal family were split in their support. Jahanara, certainly, interceded at various times on behalf of all of the princes and was well-regarded by Aurangzeb even though she shared the religious outlook of Dara. In 1656, a general underQutb Shahi dynastynamed Musa Khan led an army of 12,000 musketeers to attack Aurangzeb,and later on the same campaign Aurangzeb, in turn, rode against an army consisting 8,000 horsemen and 20,000Karnatakamusketeers. Having made clear that he wanted Dara to succeed him, Shah Jahan became ill withstranguaryin 1657 and was closeted under the care of his favourite son in the newly built city ofShahjahanabad(Old Delhi). Rumours of the death of Shah Jahan abounded and the younger sons were concerned that Dara might be hiding it for Machiavellian reasons. Thus, they took action:Shah ShujaInBengal, where he had been governor since 1637, Prince Muhammad Shuja crowned himself King at RajMahal, and brought his cavalry, artillery and river flotilla upriver towards Agra. Near Varanasi his forces confronted a defending army sent from Delhi under the command of Prince Sulaiman Shukoh, son of Dara Shukoh, and Raja Jai Singhwhile Murad did the same in his governorship of Gujarat and Aurangzeb did so in the Deccan. It is not known whether these preparations were made in the mistaken belief that the rumours of death were true or whether the challengers were just taking advantage of the situation. After regaining some of his health, Shah Jahan moved to Agra and Dara urged him to send forces to challenge Shah Shuja and Murad, who had declared themselves rulers in their respective territories. While Shah Shuja was defeated atBanaresin February 1658, the army sent to deal with Murad discovered to their surprise that he and Aurangzeb had combined their forces,the two brothers having agreed to partition the empire once they had gained control of it.The two armies clashed at Dharmat in April 1658, with Aurangzeb being the victor. Shuja was being chased throughBiharand the victory of Aurangzeb proved this to be a poor decision by Dara Shikoh, who now had a defeated force on one front and a successful force unnecessarily pre-occupied on another. Realising that his recalled Bihar forces would not arrive at Agra in time to resist the emboldened Aurangzeb's advance, Dara scrambled to form alliances in order but found that Aurangzeb had already courted key potential candidates. When Dara's disparate, hastily concocted army clashed with Aurangzeb's well-disciplined, battle-hardened force at theBattle of Samugarhin late May, neither Dara's men nor his generalship were any match for Aurangzeb. Dara had also become over-confident in his own abilities and, by ignoring advice not to lead in battle while his father was alive, he cemented the idea that he had usurped the throne.""After the defeat of Dara, Shah Jahan was imprisoned in the fort of Agra where he spent eight long years under the care of his favourite daughter Jahanara."" Aurangzeb then broke his arrangement with Murad Baksh, which probably had been his intention all along.Instead of looking to partition the empire between himself and Murad, he had his brother arrested and imprisoned at Gwalior Fort. Murad was executed on 4 December 1661, ostensibly for the murder of thediwanof Gujarat sometime earlier. The allegation was encouraged by Aurangzeb, who caused thediwan'sson to seek retribution for the death under the principles ofSharia law.Meanwhile, Dara gathered his forces, and moved to thePunjab. The army sent against Shuja was trapped in the east, its generalsJai Singhand Dilir Khan submitted to Aurangzeb, but Dara's son, Suleiman Shikoh, escaped. Aurangzeb offered Shah Shuja the governorship of Bengal. This move had the effect of isolating Dara Shikoh and causing more troops to defect to Aurangzeb. Shah Shuja, who had declared himself emperor in Bengal began to annex more territory and this prompted Aurangzeb to march from Punjab with a new and large army that fought during theBattle of Khajwa, where Shah Shuja and hischain-mailarmoured war elephants were routed by the forces loyal to Aurangzeb. Shah Shuja then fled toArakan(in present-day Burma), where he was executed by the local rulers. With Shuja and Murad disposed of, and with his father immured in Agra, Aurangzeb pursued Dara Shikoh, chasing him across the north-western bounds of the empire. Aurangzeb claimed that Dara was no longer a Muslimand accused him of poisoning the MughalGrand VizierSaadullah Khan. After a series of battles, defeats and retreats, Dara was betrayed by one of his generals, who arrested and bound him. In 1658, Aurangzeb arranged his formal coronation in Delhi. On 10 August 1659, Dara was executed on grounds of apostasy and his head was sent to Shahjahan.Having secured his position, Aurangzeb confined his frail father at the Agra Fort but did not mistreat him. Shah Jahan was cared for by Jahanara and died in 1666.",Easy

Hitler caused the death of tens of millions of people because he started World War II. He killed himself in 1945. Hitler was born into a family of six in Austria (not Germany, like some people think). Hitler's father later died in 1903, which caused him to fail his High School Exams. He left school in 1905 with no qualifications. Hitler became interested in Antisemitism. This is the false belief that Jews are either evil or otherwise not as good as other people. This caused him to hate Jews for the rest of his life, which eventually brought about the Holocaust. In 1913, Austria wanted all young Austrian men to join the army. Hitler left for Germany because he did not like the Austrian army. Hitler fought at the Battle of Ypres and the Battle of the Somme. He was given the Iron Cross in 1914. After World War I, Hitler went back to Munich. He went to the funeral march of Kurt Eisner. In 1919, Hitler joined the German Workers' Party. Two years later, he became the leader of the party which he later renamed the Nazi party. In 1925, Hitler wrote a book called Mein Kampf (or My Struggle in English) Hitler's actions, teachings, and beliefs that Jewish people were less important than others, lead to the deaths of millions of Jewish people in World War II in concentration camps, while others were attacked and murdered. This was called the Holocaust. After a first victory of the German army (the Wehrmacht), the Allies (United Kingdom, USSR, USA and others) pushed the German forces back from 1943 onwards.

The heavy rains occur most often in Autumn or Fall. Over half of Armenia's population live in cities or towns. You can find most of the population near the river valleys. The Major Nationalities in Armenia are Armenian, Russian, and Kurds. Nearly 98 percent of the People in Armenia speak Armenian. The other spoken languages in the country are Russian and Yezidi. The Armenian's were converted to Christianity in the 4th century. Today Christianity is still the most practiced religion there. There are also Russian Orthodox Christians, Protestants, and Muslims. Most Armenian's can read and write. While Armenia was under the control of the Soviet Union the government in Moscow was in control of the educational system. They believed in free and universal education. Today primary and secondary education is required and are available for free. The country's largest university is Yerevan State University, founded in 1919 in Yerevan. In the past 5 years tourism has become more important to the Armenian economy. Lake Sevan, shown in the picture to the left, is one of the sights that you can see when you go to Armenia. It is the largest lake in the country and that makes it a very popular tourist attraction. You can also visit the monasteries and churches, or some of its very old castles. Armenia has 4 UNESCO World Heritage Sites which include monasteries and churches.

It creates a burrow only inches below the surface of the Earth. This burrow has several chambers for sleeping and storing foods. It has several exits and sometimes lengthy tunnels connecting the various chambers. The chipmunk hides the entrance and exits with dry leaves, twigs, and mosses. It eats seeds, berries, and other wild fruits as well as some insects and garden bulbs like tulips and daffodils. The chipmunk searches his woodland surroundings for food and carries it back to its burrow in his cheek pouches. The Eastern chipmunk remains in its burrow through the winter when food is scarce. The animsl eats from his stores and sleeps for long periods. In the spring, he emerges and looks for a mate. His enemies are owls, hawks, foxes, house cats, and other forest predators. In the wild, he may live three years. In captivity, he may live as long as eight years. The chipmunk is a backyard animal that American families enjoy watching and feeding goodies like sunflower seeds.

"Swan Lake is a classical ballet based on German fairy tales. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky wrote the music. Julius Reisinger choreographed the first production. The ballet was first performed at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, Russia on 20 February 1877. It was not a great success. About 20 years after the Moscow premier, Swan Lake was revived in St Petersburg with choreography by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. This time, the ballet was a huge success. Modern productions of Swan Lake are usually based on the Petipa-Ivanov version of 1895. The Overture begins quietly with a theme called the Song of the Swans. It becomes louder, more intense, dramatic, and even threatening. Loud crashing chords in the brass are heard before the music subsides. The curtain rises on an old castle in Germany. Prince Siegfried is celebrating his twenty-first birthday with friends. The Prince's mother arrives. She tells her son he must choose a bride from six visiting princesses at a ball the next evening. She gives her son a beautiful crossbow as a birthday gift, then leaves. The Prince does not look forward to marriage. As evening falls, his guests leave. A flock of swans flies overhead. The Prince takes his crossbow, and hurries away to hunt them. At the edge of a lake, the Prince sees the swans land on the water. One comes ashore as a beautiful maiden. It is Odette. Odette tells Siegfried she is a princess under a magic spell cast by the sorcerer Rothbart. She is a swan by day and a maiden by night. Only a man who will promise to love her forever can break the spell. She will then become her true human self, and the sorcerer will die. Siegfried has fallen in love with Odette. He makes the promise. Suddenly, Rothbart appears as an owl. He orders Odette to join her sister swans at the lake shore. The following evening, the court assembles in the great hall. Prince Siegfried is expected to choose a bride. He shows little interest in the six princesses. He can think only of Odette. Suddenly, Rothbart enters the hall with a maiden who looks exactly like Odette. It is Rothbart's daughter Odile. Prince Siegfried believes it is Odette. He chooses her as his bride. Odette is seen at the window. She is weeping because Siegfried has broken his promise to love her forever. She disappears. Rothbart and Odile hurry away, laughing at Siegfried's distress. A storm arises. Thunder is heard and lightning flashes at the window. Siegfried runs from the hall to find Odette. At the lake shore, the swan maidens grieve for Odette and her terrible loss. Siegfried rushes in to beg Odette's forgiveness. She forgives him, but she must remain a swan forever. Rothbart enters and orders Odette away. She drowns herself in the lake. Rothbart dies. The storm grows. The lake overflows its banks, and Siegfried is drowned in the flood. In the heavens, the clouds part. Odette and Siegfried are seen united in love at last. The first performance was not a great success for several reasons: the principal ballerina was past her prime, the sets and dances were mediocre, and the music was conceived on a symphonic scale which the audience did not understand. Although the Moscow production was not a great success, the ballet was revived in 1895 for St. Petersburg, Russia with dances by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. It was performed in St. Petersburg's Mariinsky Theater. This time, the ballet was a great success. It quickly spread across Russia, Europe, and the United States. The principal role of the Swan Queen is one that all ballerinas want to perform. Like the role of Giselle, it is a test of a ballerina's technical, artistic, and dramatic powers.",Easy

"Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) is the paramilitary force responsible for safeguarding the borders of Bangladesh. Established on June 27, 1795, as the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR), it underwent a name change in 2010 to emphasize its primary role in border security. The force plays a crucial role in maintaining national security, preventing illegal activities, and ensuring the integrity of Bangladesh's borders. The roots of BGB can be traced back to the British East India Company's efforts to protect the eastern frontiers of Bengal. Over the years, the force evolved and saw various transformations before officially becoming the Border Guard Bangladesh. The primary mission of the Border Guard Bangladesh is to secure the nation's borders and prevent unauthorized entry, human trafficking, smuggling, and other illegal activities. BGB also plays a vital role in disaster management, providing assistance during natural calamities and emergencies. BGB operates under the Ministry of Home Affairs of Bangladesh and is headed by a Director-General. The force is organized into various sectors, regions, and battalions, each responsible for specific border areas. BGB personnel undergo rigorous training to equip them with the skills necessary for border security and law enforcement. Border Guard Bangladesh collaborates with neighboring countries and international organizations to enhance regional security. Coordination with the Border Security Force (BSF) of India is particularly significant, as both forces work closely to address common border challenges and maintain good diplomatic relations. BGB faces challenges such as cross-border crimes, smuggling, and illegal migration. The force has, however, achieved notable success in curbing these activities and maintaining the territorial integrity of Bangladesh. BGB personnel are recognized for their commitment to duty and their contribution to national security. Like many border security forces worldwide, BGB has faced criticism and controversies, including allegations of human rights abuses and extrajudicial activities. Such issues highlight the delicate balance between maintaining border security and respecting individual rights. In recent years, the Border Guard Bangladesh has modernized its capabilities to adapt to evolving security challenges. It seeks to employ advanced technology and training methodologies to improve effectiveness. The force remains a key pillar in ensuring the sovereignty and security of the nation, playing a vital role in border management and law enforcement.",Easy
"The head of government is a person, who is the highest or second-highest official of a country or area. The head of government presides over the cabinet. The head of government may not be confused with the head of state, which is ""the leader of the country"". For example, in the United Kingdom the queen is the head of state and the Prime Minister the head of government. In most monarchies, the head of government has more or far more influence in politics than the head of state. In those monarchies, the head of state isn't chosen but born to become a king or queen. This isn't very democratic and through the ages the head of state lost hisher powers and the head of government gained these powers. In most republics, the head of government has less or far less influence and powrrs in politics than the head of state. In these countries, the head of state is chosen in a democratic way (like elections). However, in some republics (like Germany) the head of government has still more political powers. In most countries the head of government is called a premier, first minister or prime minister (PM). Some countries use several terms and others have other terms. Germany and Austria have for example a chancellor and Ireland has a Taoiseach. In some countries, the function of head of state and head of government are combined into one person.

"Esperanto is a constructed language that was designed to make international communication easier, and to be easy to learn. It was created in the nineteenth century by Ludovic Lazarus Zamenhof, a Polish doctor. At first, Zamenhof called the language ""La Internacia Lingvo"", which means ""The International Language"" in Esperanto. Soon, people began calling it the simpler name ""Esperanto,"" which means ""the hopeful person."" That name comes from ""Doktoro Esperanto"" (""Doctor Hopeful""), which is what Zamenhof called himself in his first book about Esperanto. Some people now speak Esperanto in many countries and in all the major continents. Esperanto uses the Latin alphabet, like English, with a few differences. The letters q, w, x, and y are gone, and there are new letters ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, and ŭ. What's really different from English is that each Esperanto letter stands for one and only one sound. There are no letters that sound differently in different words (like the a in fat, fate, and father), no silent letters (like the s in island), and no sounds that take more than one letter (like the sh in fish). Most Esperanto letters that are used in English have the same sounds that they usually have in English, and almost all Esperanto letters have sounds that are used in English. The new letter ĥ is different from English, though; it has a sound like clearing your throat. (That's also the way a Scottish person would say the ch in loch.) Here are all the Esperanto letters, and their sounds: The answer is: nobody really knows. Esperanto speakers are hard to count because they are spread all over the world. Esperanto has anywhere from 2,000,000 to 10,000,000 speakers, but most of them learned it later on. Only a few thousand speak it as a native language. A speaker of Esperanto is called an Esperantist. The green star of Esperanto(Verda stelo) The Esperanto Flag(La flago de Esperanto) Jubilee symbol(Jubilea simbolo) Esperanto is spoken all over the world. Really! However, most Esperantists learn Esperanto as a second language, so nowhere is it the language of the majority of people. Esperanto speakers live in the same places as speakers of other languages. In order to identify themselves to other Esperanto speakers, Esperantists use a number of symbols. The green star of Esperanto, the verda stelo, is the oldest and most commonly used symbol. It is incorporated into the Esperanto flag. A more recent symbol called the jubilee symbol (jubilea simbolo) was designed in 1987. It is common to see all three of these symbols at an Esperanto event. Esperanto is a constructed language invented by Jewish-Polish eye doctor L.L. Zamenhof (1859 – 1917). He grew up in a city in Poland that was divided between groups who spoke different languages and did not get along. He hoped that if everyone could understand each other, they could live together in peace. In 1872, when he was only 13 years old, he began designing a language called Lingwe uniwersala (""universal language""). In 1878, at age 19, he shared his new language with a few close friends, but then he left for university to study medicine and left all of the notes about his language with his father for safe keeping. Unfortunately, his father was afraid that the idea of a universal language would cause trouble with the Russian Tsar who ruled Poland at the time, so he burned them. Zamenhof found out that all of his work had been destroyed when he came home from university in 1881. He immediately started constructing a new, improved version, which he now called Lingvo universala (which means ""universal language"" in modern Esperanto). For six years he tried to publish his new language, but the censors of the Tsar would not allow it. Instead of surrendering his dream, he used this time to improve the language and practice using it to translate many works. In 1887, Zamenhof published Unua Libro (""First Book""), to describe his universal language. Zamenhof did not use his real name when he published the book because he had already had so much trouble with the Tsar's censors. Instead, he published the book under the name Doktoro Esperanto, which is ""Dr. Someone-who-hopes"" in the language he was introducing. The name ""Esperanto"" (which means ""someone who hopes"" in Esperanto), became the name of the language. Because the language was so simple, and because there were already lots of things written in Esperanto (which Zamenhof had either written or translated while waiting on the Tsar's censors), it caught on very quickly. By 1905, the first World Congress of Esperanto (Universala Kongreso) was held in Boulogne-sur-Mer in France. By the time World War I had started in 1914, Zamenhof had been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize twice, Esperanto was part of the school curriculum in China, Samos and Macedonia, and there was even an Esperanto currency (the spesmilo). Unfortunately, Zamenhof died in 1917, and did not live to see the end of the war in 1918. After World War I, Esperanto's popularity began to soar. The horrors of the war created a desire in people for a universal peace, and Esperanto seemed the best hope for a universal language to foster communication to prevent war from happenning again. The League of Nations—the precursor to the modern United Nations—officially recommended that its members use Esperanto as a second language, and some of the most important scientific associations suggested that Esperanto be used for future scientific communication. For a while it seemed that Esperanto would become the international language for communication, science, and, of course, peace—this time, the 1920s, is considered to be the golden age of Esperanto. But the great dictators that arose in the early days of World War II—Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin—banned and brutally suppressed Esperanto. Hitler believed that there was a secret plan by Jews to rule the world, and had over six million Jewish people murdered in death camps. Since Zamenhof himself was Jewish, Hitler believed the creation of Esperanto was part of this plan, and many Esperanto speakers were killed in death camps, including members of Zamenhof's family. Meanwhile, Joseph Stalin initially promoted the language but later on banned it because he later thought it was dangerous. The League of Nations, along with many prominent Esperanto associations, did not survive the war. Since then, slowly the Esperanto movement has been rebuilding, although it is not yet at the levels it was at before World War II. Although the United Nations does not support Esperanto in the same way that the League of Nations did, some United Nations agencies support the language. The Internet and organizations like Pasporta Servo (which allows Esperanto speakers to travel by staying with other Esperantists around the world) have allowed Esperantists to keep in touch in ways they could not have in the past. Esperanto now exists only through the enthusiasm of its speakers, without the support of any nation or major international organization. L. L. Zamenhof (1859 – 1917), Zamenhof himself was the first Esperanto author. While he was waiting for the censors to allow him to publsh his language, he improved it by using it to translate a number of works, including Shakespeare. He also wrote a number of original Esperanto books and poems. Julio Baghy (1891 – 1967), Hungarian actor who wrote novels and poetry in Esperanto, and was very influential in the early development of the language for poetic use. His most famous novel is Printempo en Aŭtuno (""Springtime in Autumn"", 1931), but he is more well known for his poetry. His most influential work is his collection of poems, Preter la vivo (""Beyond Life"", 1922). William Auld (1924 – 2006), Scottish poet who was nominated three times (1999, 2004 and 2006) for the Nobel Prize in Literature for his works in Esperanto. His most famous work is La infana raso (""The Infant Race"", 1956). Claude Piron (1931 – 2008), Swiss linguist who wrote dozens of books on the language, as well as novels, poems and non-fiction books. His most famous work is [[Gerda malaperis!

"Roman houses, (domus in latin) were of several types depending on their location in the city or countryside and on the inhabitants they were designed for. They were at least three different types. Even emperors's palace were called domus. Ordinary people lived in apartment blocks called Insulae, a kind of apartment building. It housed most people of lower- or middle-class status (the plebs) and all but the wealthiest from the upper-middle class (the equites). Insulae were of poor quality, but they did have running water and sanitation. Rooms could be owned or rented. They were built in timber, mud brick, and later primitive concrete. They were restricted in height to about 20 metres. An insula dating from the early 2nd century A.D. ...in the Roman port town of Ostia. A schematic of an insula. Houses of the rich and upper classes were lavish. The atrium was the most important part of the house. It was where guests were greeted. The atrium was open in the centre, surrounded at least in part by high-ceilinged porticoes that often contained only sparse furnishings to give the effect of a large space. In the centre was a square roof opening in which rainwater could come, draining inwards from the slanted tiled roof. The master's office was placed so that the master could see what was going on. There were kitchens, bedrooms, a dining room, and a number of open rooms. Servants would use a servants' entrance, not the main entrance.

In the Empire, there was a concentration of Imperial villas near the Bay of Naples, on the Isle of Capri, at Monte Circeo on the coast and at Antium (Anzio). Wealthy Romans escaped the summer heat in the hills round Rome, especially around Frascati (such as Hadrian's Villa). Cicero had at least seven villas. The oldest of these was near Arpinum, which he inherited. Pliny the Younger had three or four, of which the example near Laurentium is the best known from his descriptions. Some sumptuous Roman villas featured complex floor mosaics, such as Villa Armira in modern Bulgaria. Late Roman owners of villas had luxuries like hypocaust-heated rooms with mosaics. Large villas were important to the Roman economy. They dominated the Po valley, Campania, and Sicily, and were also found in Gaul. Villas were centres of mining, pottery, or horse raising. Villas specializing in shipping olive oil to Roman legions in Germany were a feature of the southern Iberian province of Hispania Baetica. Some luxurious villas have been excavated in North Africa in the provinces of Africa and Numidia, or Fishbourne Palace in Britannia.",Easy
"Painting is the use of colours to make art. It is also the word for a painted work of art. Many kinds of Airless Spray poraints are used to create art. They include watercolours, acrylics and oils. Other artists like working with pencil or chalk. Sometimes charcoal can be used. Famous paintings are often kept in art galleries, like the National Gallery in London and the Louvre (Paris) where one of the most famous paintings in the world hangs, the Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo da Vinci. People do not have to go to a famous gallery to view art. There are private art galleries in many cities around the world. There is a basic difference between drawing and painting. In drawing, a single layer is the entire image. In painting, one layer is painted over another to get the final image. As a result, most of the time the image will not be clear until it gets to the final stage. There are four basic stages in painting: preparation, divide, layer, and touch-up.",Easy

"The Dhaka Metro Rail, a major infrastructural project in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, is a rapid transit system designed to alleviate the chronic congestion in one of the world's most densely populated cities. This project reflects a monumental step towards modernising the city's transportation infrastructure and improving the quality of life for its inhabitants. The idea of the Dhaka Metro Rail was conceived in response to the urgent need for a sustainable and efficient transportation solution in Dhaka, which is plagued by severe traffic congestion. The Government of Bangladesh, with support from various international financing institutions, embarked on this ambitious project to revolutionise the city's commuting experience. The project was officially launched to provide a fast, reliable, and environmentally friendly mode of urban transportation.

"Charles-Edouard Jeanneret-Gris (birth name), (6 October 1887 – 27 August 1965), known by the popular name of Le Corbusier, was an architect and writer born in Switzerland. In the 1930s, he became a French citizen. He is famous for his theories about modernism in architecture. His plans included the improvement of housing for people in large cities. This was because many people lived in poverty at that time. Many of his designs have been built across the world. He also liked to paint and was skilled at designing furniture. Le Corbusier grew up in La Chaux-de-Fonds, a small town in the north of Switzerland. In 1907, aged 19, he moved to the French city of Paris. He travelled across Europe, and learned a lot of new ideas. He learned to speak German and worked with famous architects, such as Peter Behrens. During World War I, Le Corbusier went back to Switzerland and became a teacher. Soon, he opened his own architectural business with his cousin, and they worked together until 1940. It was in 1918 that he met a painter, Amédée Ozenfant, who would become a great friend. They combined their ideas to create a new type of art called Purism. After the war, Le Corbusier concentrated on his art until 1922. After this, he began designing apartments that could be stacked on top of each other, to house people and meet their needs. This type of low-density housing was to deal with the problem of over-crowding in Paris. He said this transformation was needed, or a revolution could occur from the unhappy lower classes. He created a design for an ideal city (Ville Contemporaine) that was never built. It was a plan developed around a lot of skycrapers. He presented this plan to the French government, who refused it. This did raise their awareness of overcrowding in the city though. Le Corbusier began to dislike capitalism, and said that people's house size should depend on the size of their family, and not by how rich they were. Le Corbusier was not active in politics from 1942. Instead, he built ""unités"", smaller housing blocks around France. This is illustrated in the design below. The name, Le Corbusier, is French. It is a different version of his grandmother's surname, Lecorbésier. The name translates in to English as ""the crow like one"". He chose this name in 1920. He considered speed in architecture by saying that house is a machine to live in. This machine's purpose is to speed up the activities of the people who live in it. He introduced an idea of building residence with just some slabs, columns, and, stairs. These three things can produce any kind for residence and for any class of people.",Easy

"Annelies Marie Frank (Anne) (Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany, 12 June 1929 - Bergen-Belsen, February 1945) was a German - Jewish girl. She died during World War II, along with 6 million other Jews. She perished in the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen, Germany, in February 1945. She died of Typhoid Fever, an infectious illness usually passed onto humans by flea bites. Anne Frank became famous only after her death because of a diary she had written. After the war was over, the diary was published and has been translated into more than 70 languages. Anne is the symbol today which represents the 6 million other Jewish people who died during the Second World War. There have been many books written about her and there are also theatre plays which have been written, based on her diary. Anne received the diary as a gift from her parents for her 13th birthday, on 12 June 1942. The very first words she wrote in the diary were: I hope that I can entrust everything to you, as I have not been able to do to anyone, and I hope that you will be a great support to me. — 12 June 1942 Anne was the daughter of Otto and Edith Frank-Holländer. She had an older sister named Margot, who was born on 16 February 1926. On 13 March 1932, there was an election in Germany, in which the Nazis (people who followed Hitler) won many votes. Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933. Anne's parents realized that they and the children had no future in Germany because Adolf Hitler persecuted Jews. They fled to Amsterdam in 1933 and went to live at Merwedeplein 37 on the second floor. Anne's father Otto went to the Netherlands in the summer of 1933, Edith went in November, Anne and Margot went to their Grandmother's house in Aachen (near the Dutch border). Margot went to the Netherlands in December 1933 and Anne followed in February 1934, where she was put on the table as a birthday present for Margot. Anne and Margot both went to school in the neighborhood and learned Dutch. Anne had many friends at school and in the neighborhood, and she enjoyed playing with them. Anne loved skating, reading, watching films and she collected pictures of movie stars. The Frank family were liberal Jews. That meant that they felt connections with Jewish traditions, but were not strict about following the rules. Anne Frank had a wonderful time in Amsterdam, until the German army filed into the Netherlands and occupied it in May 1940. In 1941, everyone had to report and register if they were Jewish or Non-Jewish. There followed scores of measures against Jews and other groups that the Nazis wanted to exterminate, including Gypsies (Sinti and Roma), people with disabilities, and homosexuals. Jews weren't allowed to go to the cinema, the swimming pool, and Jewish children like Anne had to go to a Jewish school with other Jewish students. Jews were made to stay away from others. On 29 June 1942, notices were posted in all Dutch newspapers stating that the German occupiers had decided that all Jews must be sent to work camps in Germany. Margot was one of the first Jews who, on 5 July 1942, received a letter telling her that she had to go to a work camp. Anne heard from her father the following morning that they were going into hiding. Onto the back of her Father's company building at Prinsengracht 263, a small house had been built, which stood empty. It was called the ""Achterhuis"" (Secret annex) and it was part of the company ""Opekta"", which Otto Frank was a director of. On 6 July 1942, they hid themselves in that little house. Many people didn't believe that they had to go to Germany to work. They looked for houses where they could hide with the help of residents. They hoped to stay out of the hands of the Germans. But that was not easy. You had to find a place and people who would help you. It was also dangerous, because going into hiding was forbidden. The father and mother of Anne Frank had also come up with a plan. They'd been taking things to the secret annex. Four people who worked for Otto Frank decided that they wanted to help, and they all went into hiding together; Hermann van Pels, Auguste van Pels and their son Peter van Pels and later, Fritz Pfeffer. People worked for Otto Frank's company during the week and also on Saturdays. They were absolutely not allowed to know that people were in hiding in the secret annex. There were only 4 people who knew and helped those hiding there: Miep Gies, Bep Voskuijl, Johannes Kleiman and Victor Kugler. They provided food and clothing and everything else that the people in hiding needed, such as textbooks for Margot, Anne and Peter. They made curtains for the windows, and they had to be very quiet so that people who worked at the company during the day, didn't hear them. They knew that there were very heavy penalties for going into hiding, so there was a constant fear of being discovered. During the day, they could not even go to the toilet - because if they did, the people working at the company would find out there were people hiding there. They had to wait until all the people who worked there during the day, went home. Nobody knew how long the war would last. Anne regularly wrote in her diary. It became her best friend and she called it ""Kitty"". One day in 1942, Anne wrote in her diary: ""Our hiding place has only now become a real hiding place. Mr Kugler (a friend of her Father) thought it would be better to place a cupboard in front of our entrance door - but of course, a cupboard that can be rotated and that opens like a door."" Anne Frank and the other people in hiding hoped that the Germans would not find them. They thought themselves safe in the house on Prinsengracht in Amsterdam. But unfortunately, on 4 August 1944, their hiding place was discovered. The person who arrested them was called Karl Silberbauer. On 4 August 1944, a car stopped in front of the house at Prinsengracht 263 somewhere between 10:00 and 10:30am. The SS Squadron Leader, Karl Silberbauer, stepped out together with around three Dutch helpers. They had been betrayed by someone, but to this day, nobody knows who gave their secret away. It is also possible that they had been discovered during a house search. The people who had hidden there, had been there for more than two years, having arrived on 6 July 1942. Shortly after the Frank family was captured, Anne's diary and other papers were found in the secret annex by Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl. All 8 of the people who had been in hiding were taken to Camp Westerbork on 8 August, thereafter they were transported to the concentration and extermination camp at Auschwitz. Auschwitz was in Poland, which had also been occupied by the Germans. That was for Anne, the last time that she saw her father. From Auschwitz, Anne and her sister Margot were taken to the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen in Germany. Anne met one of her best friends from Amsterdam there. Her name was Hanneli Goslar. Hanneli had it somewhat better than Anne, because she sometimes got food parcels from the Red Cross. She tried to help Anne by throwing some of the food to her over the fence. Bergen-Belsen laid between the German cities of Hamburg and Hannover. Anne Frank died of Typhoid Fever around February 1945, a few days after her sister Margot. She was not even 16 years old. Six of the other hiders from the Secret Annex were taken there too. Her father, Otto Frank, was the only one from her family who remained alive.",Easy

"The Ouya, stylized as OUYA, is an Android-based microconsole developed by Ouya Inc. Julie Uhrman founded the project in 2012, bringing in designer Yves Béhar to collaborate on its design and Muffi Ghadiali as VP of Product Management to put together the engineering team. Development was funded via Kickstarter, raising US$8.5 million, becoming one of the website's highest earning projects in its history. Units started to ship to Kickstarter backers in March 2013 and were released to the general public in June 2013. It features an exclusive Ouya store for applications and games designed specifically for the Ouya platform, of which the majority are casual games targeted at or used by a mass audience of casual gamers. Out of the box, Ouya supports media apps such as Twitch and the Kodi media center. It runs a modified version of Android Jelly Bean, with rooting being officially encouraged. The console's hardware design allows it to be easily opened up, requiring only a standard screwdriver for easy modding and possible hardware add-ons. All systems can be used as development kits, allowing any Ouya owner to also be a developer, without the need for licensing fees. All games were initially required to have some kind of free-to-play aspect, whether that be completely free, has a free trial, or has purchasable upgrades, levels, or other in-game items.

"Florence Nightingale, (12 May 1820 – 13 August 1910), was an English nurse. She helped create the modern techniques of nursing. She became a leader of the team of nurses who helped wounded soldiers during the Crimean War. She was the first female to receive the Order of Merit, the highest honour awarded to a British person. As a nurse she was given the name 'The Lady with the Lamp' because at night, she checked on the wounded soldiers and always carried 'The Lamp' with her. She helped make modern nursing possible. Nightingale wrote a lot. She lived to be 90 years old. In her lifetime she was concerned with spreading medical knowledge. Some of her books were written in simple English so that they could easily be understood by those with poor reading skills. She also was an early user of graphs and diagrams to display data. Nightingale was helped to understand statistics by her country's leading expert on public statistics, William Farr. He was a founder of medical statistics, and epidemiology. Farr worked with her on all the statistics from the Crimean War, which she publicised in her writing. She proved that more men had died from disease than fighting, a very important piece of information. The disease in question was mostly cholera. Cholera is caused by a bacterium which is spread by people drinking water which is contaminated by sewage. Unfortunately, both she and Farr believed the disease was caused by foul air: this was called the miasma theory. The miasma theory was refuted by John Snow, who discovered the real cause of an outbreak in London. The cause was foul water from a water pump in Broad Street, London. Snow's work was published in 1855, but it was 30 years before the germ theory was generally accepted. Farr publicly acknowledged he was wrong in 1866, but Nightingale never really gave up the miasma idea. London's cholera epidemics stopped once the authorities built sewage treatment plants, delivered cleaner water, and built a system of underground pipes which kept sewage from seeping into the water supply. Florence Nightingale was born into an upper class British family in 1820 in Florence, Tuscany, Italy. She was named after the town where she was born. The family moved back to London when Florence was a young girl. She was a Unitarian. Although her parents expected her to become a wife and a mother, in 1845 she decided to become a nurse. While she was training she campaigned for better conditions for poor people in Britain. In 1854 when the Crimean War began, Florence was working in Harley Street in London. After reading many reports about the poor treatment of sick and injured soldiers, she travelled to Crimea to see for herself and discovered the hospitals were crowded and dirty. She knew Sidney Herbert, who was Secretary of War during the Crimean War and he helped her. At the hospital in Istanbul where the injured soldiers were sent, Florence realized that soldiers died more often from diseases like cholera than from their injuries in war. She used her knowledge of maths and statistics to show the British government that providing better conditions for sick and injured soldiers would help them win the war. She was, however, quite wrong about how cholera spread. There is a syndrome named after her called ""Florence Nightingale Syndrome"". It occurs when a soldier falls in love with a nurse. While she was working in Crimea she became known as “The Lady with the Lamp” because she would walk around the hospital in the evening carrying a lamp and check on the soldiers. When she returned to England she started a school in 1860 for nurses at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London. She wrote her most important book Notes on Nursing. She was a keen Christian but also believed that pagan and eastern religions also contained genuine worth. She was a strong opponent of discrimination against all types of Christians as well as against non-Christians. Nightingale believed religion helped provide people with the fortitude for arduous good work. In 1907, Florence Nightingale became the first woman to be awarded the Order of Merit by King Edward VII. Nightingale died in 1910 in London. There are many statues of her in Britain, including one in Waterloo Place in London and a Florence Nightingale museum, also in London.",Easy

"The Spinosaurus was an extinct Dinosaur that had lived during the Cretaceous period, about 112 million years to 97 million years ago. They are the largest carnivorous dinosaurs, even bigger than the Tyrannosaurus and lived in the swamps of North Africa. It was thought to be the largest meat-eater to have ever roamed the Earth. Its scientific name is just “Spinosaurus” and it means “Spine Lizard.” It is an theropod (carnivorous dinosaurs which sizes are large and small). According to scientific research, the Spinosaurus possibly fed mainly on Fish, including large lungfish, sawfish and even Sharks. Since it is a carnivorous dinosaur, it probably ate plant-eating dinosaurs too. It also liked to eat eggs. The Spinosaurus was incredibly huge and was about 12.6 to 18m long (40-50 ft) and it weighed about 13.2 to 23 tons. The dinosaur had a small crest above its eyes and had a long and narrow snout at the end of its skull. It also had a very powerful jaw, but none of its teeth were serrated, which makes it unlikely to tear its prey. The Spinosaurus’s sail made it famous and it was located along its back. It was long, rough, semi-circular and has many functions. There was a lot of debate regarding what the sail could do. It could’ve been used to ward off its enemies, which would give it an advantage in fighting. It also could have been used to regulate its body temperature by absorbing heat or storing fat. The final possibility is that the dinosaur may have used its sail to attract mates, making it have a similar function to a Peacock’s tail.",Easy

"Alcohol is a word generally used to describe Ethylene Alcohol or Ethanol, which is the product found in alcoholic drinks, in certain food recipes, and in laboratories. The word Alcohol is also used to designate all alcoholic drinks, such as wine, beer and champagne. We sometimes say, for example, that whisky, is a very strong alcohol, to signify that it's a strongly alcoholic drink; the official term is spirits. In chemistry, the term alcohol designates an entire family of molecules, including those of a specific group: the Hydroxyl group (OH). Ethanol is a solvent with the chemical formula C2H6O, which permits the dissolution or dilution of numerous fatty and aromatic chemical substances. It can be mixed in all proportions with water. In its normal condition, it's a completely colourless liquid, which possesses a characteristic odour, and it's highly flammable. It evaporates very easily: if you get it on your skin, you can feel that it's cold. It is thanks to this property that we can distill alcohol. If you heat a mixture of ethanol and water, the ethanol evaporates much quicker than the water. If you pass the ethanol vapours through a cold tube, it permits the evaporated alcohol to become liquid again (condensation). The molecules of the alcohol family are characterised by a hydroxyl function, a group formed of one atom of Oxygen and one atom of Hydrogen (-OH). Modified camphorated ethanol - over the counter in pharmacies - is a good disinfectant. It destroys bacteria and many other microbes in an instant. But on damaged, cut, or scratched skin, ethanol stings a lot! On healthy skin, you feel a cold sensation (the cold is caused by the heat that ethanol absorbs to evaporate). It is this ethanol that the nurse uses on your skin before giving you an injection. Ethanol can also be used as a household solvent, to remove traces of glue, such as under a plaster for example. However, care must be taken to ventilate the room well: ethanol evaporates easily and the vapours from it can make you drunk. Ethanol is sometimes used as a fire starter for a barbecue. It is highly flammable and very dangerous! For some years now there have been cars and trucks in some countries around the world, such as Brazil, that can use an ethanol gasoline blend to operate. This ethanol is produced from cultivated plants such as sugar cane or rapeseed. It is a way of limiting the consumption of oil which is a non-renewable energetic resource. Ethanol is produced from the fermentation of sugars by a yeast. Most living organisms are able to convert ethanol to acetic acid. In humans, this mainly occurs in the liver. To produce an alcoholic beverage, you need a juice containing sugar (such as sucrose, which is powdered sugar) or starch, which is contained for example, in potatoes. A microbe is added to the juice which is capable of making alcoholic fermentation. The most common is brewer's yeast. Then, you have to wait varying lengths of time, depending on the sugar concentration and the strength of alcohol you want. In industry, it is possible to produce large quantities of ethanol from the cellulose contained in wood and plants. The process is complex but very efficient. Ethanol is a poison for all forms of life, which is why it is used as a disinfectant or local antiseptic in the form of modified camphorated alcohol. Ethanol destroys the membranes of cells, which kills them. If you ingest ethanol, the body tries to fight off the poison by turning it into Acetaldehyde and then Acetic acid (found in vinegar). Ethanol itself and Acetaldehyde are both poisons for cells, and more particularly for nerve cells: even at low concentration they disturb the functioning of nerves, which causes ""intoxication"" or ""drunkenness"". Drunkenness is a phenomenon where all normal reactions are slowed down, with or without changes in behaviour or disturbances of consciousness. The slowing of reactions can range from a simple lengthening of the reflexes to coma, then to death. It is the role of the liver to eliminate alcohol. The lungs are also involved in removing alcohol from the blood. A person who has drunk alcohol breathes some of it out. The amount he exhales is proportionate to the amount he has in the blood. We can therefore blow someone into a balloon and measure the level of alcohol ingested. This is useful for detecting people who have been drinking alcohol and driving a car, putting their lives and those of others at risk. Mammals can survive varying doses of ethanol. For example, a thimble of ethanol (a few millilitres) can kill a rabbit. If ethanol is introduced regularly and in small doses, the organism becomes able to survive in increasing doses. But the drunkenness remains, which endangers the drunken person and anyone with them because of their reduced reflexes (road accidents) and the modification of their behaviour (violent or aggressiveness). Regular consumption of ethanol causes changes in the body, which adapts to fight the poison. The main organ in this fight is the liver, which becomes exhausted and becomes ill (a condition called Cirrhosis). There may even be cancer of the liver. But other organs are affected: the heart, blood vessels, stomach, pancreas and the whole digestive tract, as well as the brain, which can suffer irreversible damage. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is very dangerous for a growing baby (foetus) which is unable to resist the toxic effects of alcohol. Babies which grow when a mother is drinking alcohol, are often born with learning or physical disabilities, such as deafness or blindness. This is an illness called Foetal Alcohol Syndrome. Alcohol is also used as a treatment for methanol poisoning. Ethanol is present in all alcoholic beverages, at a higher or lower concentration, such as cider, wine, etc. It comes from the fermentation of a juice, often from a plant rich in sugar, (apple juice, grape juice , but also potato) juice and sometimes even milk: the more sugar the juice contains, the more alcohol the drink obtained may contain. The ethanol concentration must appear on the bottle: it is measured in percent or in alcoholic degrees (proof). The various alcoholic drinks are traditionally served in specific glasses. Per type of drink the standard glass contains approximately 10 grams of alcohol. Thus, a cup or flute of champagne moderately filled (that is to say about 100 millilitres of liquid) contains as much alcohol as a glass of wine at 12% (that is to say, how much alcohol the drink contains). A glass of 5% beer on tap, or a bottle, or about 250 millilitres of liquid, also contains 10 grams of alcohol. A shot of whisky at 40% (or 30 millilitres of liquid) or a dose of pastis at 45% (or approximately 30 millilitres of liquid), also contain 10 grams of alcohol. Adding water or ice cubes to these last two drinks does not affect the amount of alcohol they contain. Regular consumption of ethanol is a disease called alcoholism or alcoholic illness. Alcohol is a drug, that is to say it modifies the perception that we have of the world by acting on the brain. Ethanol has been consumed for thousands of years (back to about 7000 BCE) for its actions on the soul. The modification of behaviour, consciousness and mood, as well as the relaxation perceived by the drunken person is sometimes experienced as pleasant (sometimes also unpleasant) but is addictive: after a short time, one cannot do without 'alcohol. This addiction is impossible to avoid, and very hard to lose. This is why it is very important to control how much alcohol you drink.",Easy

"The Battle of Harpers Ferry was fought September 12–15, 1862. It was part of the Maryland Campaign of the American Civil War. As Gen. Robert E. Lee's Confederate army invaded Maryland, a portion of his army under Maj. Gen. Thomas J. ""Stonewall"" Jackson was sent to capture Harpers Ferry. His troops surrounded, bombarded, and captured the Union garrison at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia). This was a major victory at relatively minor cost. During the Maryland Campaign of 1862, Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia advanced north through the Shenandoah Valley into Maryland. Lee planned to capture the garrison at Harpers Ferry to secure his line of supply back to Virginia. The Confederate Army was being pursued at a leisurely pace by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's Army of the Potomac. Even though the Union Army outnumbering him more than two to one, Lee chose the risky strategy of dividing his army. He sent one portion to converge and attack Harpers Ferry from three directions. Col. Dixon S. Miles, Union commander at Harpers Ferry, insisted on keeping most of the troops near the town instead of taking up commanding positions on the surrounding heights. He had been ordered by McClellan to hold the town until McClellan could send more soldiers. The slim defenses of the most important position, Maryland Heights, first encountered the approaching Confederate on September 12. But there was only a brief skirmishing. Strong attacks by two Confederate brigades on September 13 drove the Union troops from the heights. During the fighting on Maryland Heights, the other Confederate columns arrived. They were astonished to see that critical positions to the west and south of town were not defended. Jackson methodically positioned his artillery around Harpers Ferry and ordered Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill to move down the west bank of the Shenandoah River in preparation for a flank attack on the Federal left the next morning. By the morning of September 15, Jackson had positioned nearly 50 guns on Maryland Heights and at the base of Loudoun Heights. He began a fierce artillery barrage from all sides and ordered an infantry assault. Miles realized that the situation was hopeless. He agreed with his subordinates to raise the white flag of surrender. Before he could surrender personally, he was mortally wounded by an artillery shell and died the next day. After processing more than 12,000 Union prisoners, Jackson's men then rushed to Sharpsburg, Maryland, to rejoin Lee for the Battle of Antietam.",Easy
"Roman houses, (domus in latin) were of several types depending on their location in the city or countryside and on the inhabitants they were designed for. They were at least three different types. Even emperors's palace were called domus. Ordinary people lived in apartment blocks called Insulae, a kind of apartment building. It housed most people of lower- or middle-class status (the plebs) and all but the wealthiest from the upper-middle class (the equites). Insulae were of poor quality, but they did have running water and sanitation. Rooms could be owned or rented. They were built in timber, mud brick, and later primitive concrete. They were restricted in height to about 20 metres. An insula dating from the early 2nd century A.D. ...in the Roman port town of Ostia. A schematic of an insula. Houses of the rich and upper classes were lavish. The atrium was the most important part of the house. It was where guests were greeted. The atrium was open in the centre, surrounded at least in part by high-ceilinged porticoes that often contained only sparse furnishings to give the effect of a large space. In the centre was a square roof opening in which rainwater could come, draining inwards from the slanted tiled roof. The master's office was placed so that the master could see what was going on. There were kitchens, bedrooms, a dining room, and a number of open rooms. Servants would use a servants' entrance, not the main entrance. Slaves could not leave the house without the permission of the master. The domus was not just a house; it was a place of business as well. A slave eating room of a reconstructed domus. Kitchen.

The villa urbana, was a country seat in easy reach of Rome (or another city). The villa rustica was a farm-house estate, like the later English country house. It was occupied by servants who ran the estate. In the Empire, there was a concentration of Imperial villas near the Bay of Naples, on the Isle of Capri, at Monte Circeo on the coast and at Antium (Anzio). Wealthy Romans escaped the summer heat in the hills round Rome, especially around Frascati (such as Hadrian's Villa). Cicero had at least seven villas. The oldest of these was near Arpinum, which he inherited. Pliny the Younger had three or four, of which the example near Laurentium is the best known from his descriptions. Some sumptuous Roman villas featured complex floor mosaics, such as Villa Armira in modern Bulgaria. Late Roman owners of villas had luxuries like hypocaust-heated rooms with mosaics. Large villas were important to the Roman economy. They dominated the Po valley, Campania, and Sicily, and were also found in Gaul. Villas were centres of mining, pottery, or horse raising. Villas specializing in shipping olive oil to Roman legions in Germany were a feature of the southern Iberian province of Hispania Baetica.

"Damascus (sometimes called the city of Jasmin) is the Capital city of Syria. It is the largest city in Syria with about 4.8 million people living there in 2010. Damascus is thought to be one of oldest cities in the world that still has people living in it. It is believed that people started living in Damascus as long ago as 8000 BC to 10000BC (10000 years ago). Damascus is about 50 miles inland from the Mediterranean Sea, sheltered by the Anti-Lebanon Mountains. Damascus used to play an important role as an important trade center. Now it is not because of political development in the region as well as the development of modern trade. Most goods produced in Damascus, as well as in Syria, are distributed to Countries of the Arabian peninsula. Damascus also holds an annual international trade exposition in the fall since 1955. Most goods produced in Damascus, as well as in Syria, are given to Countries of the Arabian peninsula. Damascus also holds an annual international trade exposition in the fall since 1955. Damascus has many historical sites dating back to many different periods of the city's history. Since the city has been built up with every passing job, it has become almost impossible to dig out all the ruins of Damascus that lie up to 2 or 3 meters below the modern level. The Citadel of Damascus is located in the northwest corner of the Old City. The Bab Sharqi street is filled with small shops and leads to the old Christian quarter of Bab Tuma (St. Thomas's Gate). Medhat Pasha Souq is also a main market in Damascus and was named after Medhat Pasha. At the end of the Bab Sharqi street, one reaches the House of Ananias, an underground chapel that was the cellar of Ananias's house.

"Roy Rogers, (Birth name: Leonard Franklin Slye) (November 5, 1911 – July 6, 1998), was an American singer and cowboy actor. Roy Rogers Restaurants chain was named after him. He and his wife Dale Evans, his golden horse (name:Trigger), and his German Shepherd dog (name:Bullet), came in more than 100 movies and The Roy Rogers Show. The show came on radio and then came on television from 1951 through 1957. His productions usually had a sidekick (a companion), usually either Pat Brady, (who drove a Jeep called ""Nellybelle"") or Andy Devine, or the crotchety (irritating) George ""Gabby"" Hayes. Rogers's nickname was ""King of the Cowboys"". Evans's nickname was ""Queen of the West."" Leonard Franklin Slye was born in Cincinnati, Ohio in USA. His parents' name was Andrew and Mattie Syle. His family lived in a tenement building (apartment on rent) on 2nd Street. (Riverfront Stadium was built at this place in 1970 and Leonard joked that he had been born at second base.) His father, Andrew Syle was not happy with his job and city life. So,Andy Slye and his brother Will built a 12-by-50-foot houseboat from salvage lumber. Then, in July 1912, the Slye family floated on the Ohio River towards Portsmouth, Ohio. The Syles family wanted a more stable life in Portsmouth. So, they bought land on which they could built a home. But, because of the flood of 1913, they were able to move their houseboat to the land. So, they continued living in the houseboat on dry land. In 1919, the Slyes bought a farm in Duck Run, located near Lucasville, Ohio which is 12 miles north of Portsmouth. There they built a six-room home. But the farm alone could not give a good income for his family, so Leorand's father, Andrew took a job at a shoe factory in Portsmouth. He lived there during the week and came back home on the weekends. He used to bring gifts for his family after paydays (the day payment is given). One important gift was a horse on which Leonard learned how to ride a horse. After Leonard comleted his eight grade, he studied at High School in McDermott, Ohio. When he was 17, his family returned to Cincinnati. In Cincinnati, his father started work at another shoe factory. Leonard also wanted to help his family to earn more money. So, he left high school. He started to work with his father at the shoe factory and went to night school. Leonard was made laughed at (made fun of) for sleeping in class. So, he left the night school and never joined again. Leonard and his father did not like their factory jobs. In 1929, his older sister, Mary, went to Lawndale, California with her husband. Leonard and his father left their shoe factory jobs. The family lived with Mary for four months and then cam back to Ohio. Soon, Leonard got to go to California with Mary's husband's father. Rest of the family came to California in the spring of 1930. The Slyes took a small house on rent near Mary. Leonard and his father very soon found jobs as truck drivers for a highway making project. But, when they came to work they got to know that their employer (person who gives job) had become bankrupt (did not have enough money). Soon, came the years of Great Depression. The Slyes were now moving from job to job collecting fruit and living in worker camps. One day, Andrew Slye got to know about a shoe factory giving jobs in Los Angeles. Andrew asked Leonard to join him. Leonard used to feel happy playing guitar and singing around campfires. So, he told his father that he wanted to earn money through music. His father allowed him to do so. Leonard and his cousin Stanley Slye went to Los Angeles and started to perform as The Slye Brothers. Leonard now came to be known as Len. In 1932, he met Lucille Ascolese while on tour. The same year, a palomino colt (a breed of horse) was born in Santa Cietro, CA. The young horse was first named ""Golden Cloud"", and later renamed ""Trigger"". In May 1933, Len, 21, proposed to Lucille, 19, through radio. Len then went on tour with the ""O-Bar-O Cowboys"". In June 1933, Len met Grace Arline Wilkins at a radio station in New Mexico. She gave Len a lemon pie in return of his singing ""Swiss Yodel"" on the radio. By August 1934, Len and Lucille had separated as she was jealous and tired of being a musician's wife. Len and Lucille's divorced on June 8, 1936.

In an attempt to rebuild the Empire, emperor Justinian I conquered the city. From 550 to 621, Málaga was part of the Byzantine Empire, but Visigoths finally took control of the city again. This situation remained until the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by moors, who vanquished the former settlers.",Easy
"The Sahara in North Africa, is the one of the largest deserts in the world. The Sahara has about the same size as the whole United States. It has been both larger and smaller at different times. After the last ice age it became more fertile, then dried up again. Most parts are uninhabited, but some people manage to survive in places where there is water. It is the hottest place on the Earth, but the driest place is the Atacama Desert in South America. It is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the Atlas Mountains, the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Sahel region. Inside it are parts of many countries, including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad, and The Sudan. The highest mountain is 3415 m, and is the Emi Koussi in Chad. Some mountain peaks in the Sahara Desert have snow even in the summer. The main mountain ranges is the Atlas Mountains in Algeria. The Sahara's lowest point lies in the Qattara Depression in Egypt, at about 130 metres below sea level. An erg (also sand sea or dune sea, or sand sheet if it lacks dunes) is a broad, flat area of desert covered with wind-swept sand with little or no vegetative cover. An erg is defined as a desert area that contains more than 125 square kilometres (48 sq mi) of aeolian or wind-blown sand and where sand covers more than 20% of the surface. Smaller areas are known as ""dune fields"". Sand seas and dune fields are about 25% of the Sahara. It is a desert rocky surface. see: reg or desert pavement Hoggar in Algeria (photography taken in December) Desert pavement in Mauritania (photography taken in January) Sand dunes in the Sahara desert (photography taken in January) Hammada in western Egypt (photography taken in March) There are several rivers running through the Sahara. However, most of them (wadis) come and go through the seasons, they flow only after rain, except for the Nile River and Niger River. Metallic minerals are very important to most Saharan countries. Algeria and Mauritania have several major deposits of iron ore. There are also bits of uranium, while Niger has the largest parts of them. A lot of phosphates are in Morocco and Western Sahara. Oil is mainly found in Algeria. The oil is very important to the economy of the entire country. While the mineral exploitation has led to economic growth in Sahara, this has rarely helped the indigenous population, as skilled workers have been brought from other countries. Of the Sahara's around 4 million people, most live in Mauritania, Western Sahara, Algeria, Libya and Egypt. Dominant groups of people are Sahrawis, Tuareg and Negroids. The largest city is Nouakchott, Mauritania's capital. Other important cities are Tamanrasset in Algeria, and Sebha and Ghat in Libya. The soil in Sahara is low in organic matter. The soil in depressions is often saline.Only 200,000km² of Sahara are fertile oases, where dates, corn, and fruits are grown. The few fertile regions today are fed by underground rivers and underground basins. Many of Sahara's oases rests in depressions (areas under sea level) allowing water to surface from underground reservoirs; artesian wells. Animal life is limited to gazelles, antelopes, jackals, sand foxes, badgers and hyena. Animal life of Sahara include gerbil, jerboa, cape hare and desert hedgehog, barbary sheep, oryx, deer, wild ass, weasel and mongoose. The bird life counts more than 300 species. Other sorts of vegetation include scattered concentrations of grasses, shrubs and trees in the highlands, as well as in the oases and along river beds. Some plants are well adjusted to the climate, allowing them to germinate within 3 days of rain and sow their seeds within 2 weeks after that. Adapted from the Simple English Wikipedia: Sahara ",Easy
"The western gorilla (scientific name: Gorilla gorilla) and the eastern gorilla (scientific name: Gorilla beringei) are the only two species of gorilla. There are two subspecies of the western gorilla: the western lowland gorilla (scientific name: Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and the Cross River gorilla (Scientific name: Gorilla gorilla diehli). Cross River gorillas closely resemble western lowland gorillas, but differ in the dimensions of their skulls and teeth. The Cross River gorilla was thought extinct. It was rediscovered in the 1980s. In 2014, it numbered less than 300. This subspecies lives along the southern edge of the Nigeria-Cameroon border in low to middle elevation rainforests and mountain forests. The Cross River gorilla reproduces slowly. Females give birth only once every four to five years. It depends on conservation efforts and law enforcement to survive. The Cross River gorilla is the most endangered African ape. Human developments and poaching are two of the main reasons this gorilla must fight for survival.",Easy
"Dewan Hason Raja Chowdhury, or simply known as Hason Raja (Bengali: হাসন রাজা; 21 December 1854 – 6 December 1922) was a Bengali mystic poet and songwriter from Sylhet, Bengal Presidency (now Bangladesh).His unique style of music made him one of the most prominent figures in Bengali folk culture. Raja was born on 21 December 1854 in Lakshmansree, now Sunamganj to a Bengali Muslim zamindar family. His father was Dewan Ali Raja, the grandson of Birendraram Singhdev (later converted from Hinduism to Islam and renamed as Dewan Raja Babu Khan).Hason Raja's mother was Hurmat Jahan Bibi, the last and fifth wife of Dewan Ali Raja Chowdhury of Kauriya. Hurmat was previously a widow after the death of her former husband, Muhammad Asim Chowdhury. Hason Raja spent most of his childhood in Lakshmansree with his mother as his father married widow of his first cousin late Amir Baksh Chowdhury who was living at Lahshmansree (Sunamganj) the most north-eastern part of now Bangladesh. His father started on and off living in Lakshmanshree of Sunamganj, 33 miles away from Rampasha, for at least three or four months of the year. Ali supervised and managed his wife's properties at Lakshmansree. That is why Lakshmansree was his birthplace of the poet. The death of Raja's elder half-brother, Ubaidur Raja, followed by the death of his father (in about 40 days gap), put the power and responsibility of the whole family upon Hason Raja at a very young age.

"Greece (Hellenic Republic) is a country in southern Europe. It shares borders with Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania and Turkey. The capital city is Athens. Other big cities in Greece are Thessaloniki, Patras and Piraeus. Greece is well known for it's history and it's islands. The country is also a member of the European Union and uses the Euro as its currency along with 16 other countries in Europe. Greece is heir to the heritages of ancient Greece, the Romans and the Byzantine Empire, and nearly four hundred years of Ottoman rule. Greece is the birthplace of democracy, the Olympic Games, western books, and western theatre (see theatre of ancient Greece. The Iliad, an epic poem written by Homer in the 8th Century BC, is the oldest work of western writing. Ancient Greece was not a single country; Ancient Greece was divided into lots of small city-states in the south and two kingdoms in the north. Generally the south was much more advanced; Athens and Sparta, the most powerful Greek cities, were in the south. There were many wars between the cities, and it was not until 338 BC (338 'before Christ') when they were all united to fight against the Persians under King Philip II of Macedon, one of the two kingdoms of the north. When Philip died his son, Alexander the Great, took his place and campaigned against Persia, establishing a new era, the Hellenistic era. After the Hellenistic era, in 146 BC, the Roman period began when the Romans ruled over Greek lands. After a century the whole Greek-speaking world became part of the Roman Empire. Greek was the language used by most of the people in the eastern parts of the Empire, while Latin was spoken more in the west. In 330 AD the capital of the Roman Empire changed; Byzantium, an ancient Greek city, became the new capital, which was then renamed to Constantinople (in Greek: 'The city of Constantine' meaning the emperor who chose Byzantium as the new capital). In the following years the Roman Empire was divided into two parts; the east part became the Byzantine Empire. In 1453 the siege of Constantinople by the Turks took place, the Ottoman Empire was then established. For almost four centuries, Greece was part of the Ottoman Empire. In 5 March 1821 Greeks started a revolution so they could be independent. Greece became an independent country on 3 February 1830. Many wars occurred before Greece gained the lands it has today. Greece also took part in the two World Wars. Greece fought alongside the Allies in World War II and the Entente in World War I. A civil war took place after the World Wars, too. After a military junta of 1967–1974 a vote was held for Greeks to decide whether they wanted Greece to become a Republic or to remain a Kingdom. The Greek vote of December 8, 1974, resulted in the end of the monarchy in Greece and the establishment of the current Third Hellenic Republic. Greece became the tenth member of the European Union on January 1, 1981. The country adopted the Euro in 2001 and successfully organized the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. At the moment Greece is facing big economic and social problems. Four fifths of Greece consist of mountains or hills, making the country one of the most mountainous in Europe. The highest mountain in Greece is Olympus, the mythical house of the ancient Greek gods. Western Greece contains a number of lakes and wetlands. Greece has also many islands, over 6,000, the largest being Crete. Other well-known large islands are Rhodes, Santorini and Corfu. Greece is an active earthquake zone, small earthquakes occur every year in Greece, especially in Western and Southern Greece. Greece has a coastline of over 13,600 kilometres. Mount Olympus, at 2,917 metres, is the highest mountain in the country and is believed to be the home of the Greeks Gods in Greek Mythology. The climate of Greece can be categorized into three types: the Mediterranean, the Alpine and the Temperate. The Mediterranean type of climate features mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The Alpine type of climate features harsh winters with large snowfalls, while the summers are cool with many thunderstorms. This climate is to be found on high mountains. The Temperate type of climate features cold, damp winters and hot, dry summers. Greek Alphabet through the ages Greece's population is around 11 million. The majority of people living in the country are ethnic Greeks with some people from foreign countries like Albania and Bulgaria staying in the country at the moment. The most spoken language in Greece is Greek, as well as the official language of the state. But there are also people who speak Bulgarian and Turkish close to the borders with Bulgaria and Turkey. Greek language has a history of almost 4,000 years. English is widely spoken as a foreign language, along with other languages such as French, German, Italian and Spanish among others. These five languages are also provided around the country's schools. Education in Greece is required from the ages of 5 to 15. The majority of Greek people are Greek (Eastern) Orthodox (95%) and it is also the state religion. There are other Christian groups in Greece, too, the largest being Catholic Christians; the majority lives in the Cyclades and the Ionian Islands. The country's oldest religious minority is the Jewish community, however, it is no longer the largest non-Christian group. There are also some Muslims residing in the Northern Greek region of Thrace, close to the Turkish borders. Greek cuisine is a typical Mediterranean cuisine, similar to those of Italy, the Balkans, Turkey, and the Middle East. The majority of national foods are based around olive oil, vegetables and herbs, grains and bread, wine, fish, and various meats. Also important are olives, cheese, aubergine, courgette, and yoghurt. Greek desserts are characterized by the dominant use of nuts and honey. Greek salad is widely known around the globe. The most famous sport among Greeks is probably football.

"Osteoporosis is an illness where the bones in the body become weaker. It is caused by too little calcium being added to bones. The low level of calcium causes bones to become brittle (break easily), leading to the name sometimes given to the illness, Brittle Bone Disease. Some of the symptoms include bone pain and fractures (breaks or cracks in bones) happening too easily . Women are more likely to get Osteoporosis than men are  and, similarly, older people are more likely to get it than young people - although it has been seen in children. The amount of calcium you have in your bones becomes less as you get older. Your bones are strongest when you're around 30 years old. Unfortunately, there is no cure for Osteoporosis. There are ways to stop it from happening by getting exercise and making sure you get enough calcium in your diet. You can get calcium from lots of different sources such as milk, watercress and sardines. Vitamin D, which is produced by your body when you're exposed to sunlight, is also helpful in stopping you from getting Osteoporosis. Drinking things which contain caffeine and alcohol make it more likely that you will get Osteoporosis and having too much salt in your food causes you to lose more calcium in your urine when you go to the toilet.",Easy

"Montsoreau is a historic town in the Loire Valley in western France. It is part of the department of Maine-et-Loire, Pays de la Loire region, and situated 250 kilometers from Paris. Montsoreau is famous for its Château. The town is part of the French association of The Most Beautiful Villages of France. In 2000, the Loire Valley between Sully-sur-Loire and Chalonnes, in particular Montsoreau and the Château de Montsoreau, was inscribed on the list of World Heritage sites by UNESCO. The name of Montsoreau comes from the rock on which is currently built the castle of Montsoreau, Mont Soreau (in Latin Mons Sorello, monte Sorello or Monte Sorelli). No explanation was given on the interpretation of the name Sorello. Montsoreau is a very old place, which still holds Neolithic and Gallo-Roman remains. The first texts mention a fishing village in the year 600 under the name Restis (Filet). According to archaeological excavations, it seems that at that time a temple or an administrative building occupied the rock of Montsoreau. It is the Count of Blois, who first (996) build a fortress on Mount Soreau. This fortress was very quickly conquered by the Count of Anjou, who subsequently modified it and made it impregnable. It was taken only once in its history, by the King of England Henry II, in 1152. In 1450, John II de Chambes (the first adviser to King Charles VII) bought the fortress from his brother-in-law, destroyed it and built the castle still in place. The site where the city is built is in the immediate vicinity of the confluence of the Vienne and the Loire rivers. The city is crossed by the Loire and has an island on its right bank, the island of Than. Montsoreau is a small town of 447 inhabitants and it is part of the agglomeration of Saumur-Val de Loire which has a little more than 100,000 inhabitants.

"Quartiere Quadronno is a district (""quartiere"") of Milan, Italy, called also Quartiere Quadronno-Guastalla. It is located within the Zone 1 (the historical core of the city) and it is centred on Via Quadronno. Quadronno is the coolest, high luxury residential neighbourhood in Milan. The name stems from Medieval Italian ""Cadronno"" derived from Old Lombardic meaning the name of a beautiful, blue river that surrounded the area. Quadronno was the only area within the defensive walls of Milan, in which plants and trees grew, in particular sacred mulberry plants. Usually inside the defensive walls there were no trees to have visibility for safety of the city. Quadronno is the best neighborhood for feeling a luxury vip ""milanese"". The entire Brera district has the aura of an aristocratic cultured nobility. The neighborhood includes various buildings of global interest, such as the palaces of star architects from the 1950s who created the design system in Italy, mainly in the Italian rationalist style and in the MAC-Movimento Arte Concreta movement. It is, after the Milan Cathedral, the most important religious building in the history of Milan. The oldest mention of the church is found in an epigram of bishop Ennodius in 474-521. It is a basilica of early Christian origin, dedicated to one of the first bishops of Milan, adjacent to the Diocesan Historical Archives and a stone's throw from the Convent of the Visitation. In the excavations carried out in 1905 during which some bricks dating back to the factory of King Theodoric (493-526) were found. It also seems that a temple of Apollo stood near or in its place, information that can be obtained from the ""De situ civitatis Mediolani"", a text from the 9th-10th century. From inside the church you can go down into the entirely frescoed crypt, in which there is the well of San Calimero, where, as has been handed down to us, Calimero, then the fourth bishop of Milan. The church was built around the well and according to legend on July 31st, the feast day of San Calimero, the water from the well was given to the sick to drink because it was believed to be miraculous. What remains of the ancient church today is above all the sixteenth-century crypt, with a vault frescoed by the Fiammenghini. Furthermore, a small fresco survives (Madonna between two saints, 15th century, attributed to Cristoforo Moretti), a Crucifixion by Cerano and a Nativity by Marco d'Oggiono (altered by recent repaintings which make it illegible in several places, but which demonstrates how d'Oggiono was inspired by the Master Leonardo da Vinci). Other medieval frescoes are found in the adjacent sacristy. Other important works are the neoclassical main altar with a circular ciborium supported by Corinthian columns; Altar of Sant'Arialdo da Carimate with a bas-relief depicting Saint Erlembaldo Cotta. For the modern frescoes, the painter Augusto Lozzia (1896 – 1962) lent his mastery; On the choir loft to the left of the presbytery, behind a three-light window supported by small columns, there is the pipe organ, built by Giuseppe Bernasconi in 1884 and restored by the Mascioni company in 2014. The street art is very present in Quadronno, in a real open air museum, in via San Calimero, the street located between via Santa Sofia and Via Francesco Sforza, next to the church of San Calimero is the old rectory building, whose façade was entirely repainted by the street artist Ivan Tresoldi, famous for his poems scattered on the walls of the city. The mural is a Gothic-inspired black and red writing that seems to have come from a page of an ancient manuscript. The work was commissioned with other names of important artists like Paolo Bordino and Laura Pasquazzo, by the Gaetano Pini orthopedic institute which, to celebrate its 140th anniversary, with the support of the Cariplo Foundation and the patronage of the Municipality of Milan, developed Wall Art. Ivan Tresoldi's, known as the graffiti poet, murals continue on the façade of the Diocesan Archive adjacent to the rectory, while on the other side of the square, along the wall of the Gaetano Pini hospital, Wall Art unfolds, the very long street art work by Orticanoodles (Walter Contipelli and Alessandra Montanari): 14 Milanese celebrities depicted in shades of brown and yellow, interspersed with equally famous quotes.

"A kernel is the central part of an operating system. It manages the tasks of the computer and the hardware - most notably memory and CPU time. There are two types of kernels: A computer user never interacts directly with the kernel. It runs behind the scenes and cannot be seen, except for the text logs that it prints. The kernel is the most fundamental part of an operating system. It can be thought of as the program which controls all other programs on the computer. It is responsible for the creation and destruction of memory space which allows software to run. It provides services so that programs can request the use of the network driver, the disk or any other piece of hardware (the kernel forwards that request to special programs called drivers which control the hardware), manages the file system and sets interrupts for the CPU to enable multitasking. Many kernels are also responsible for ensuring that faulty programs do not interfere with the operation of others, by denying access to memory that has not been allocated to them and restricting the amount of CPU time they can consume. Operating systems commonly use Monolithic kernels. In Linux for example, drivers are often implemented as part of a kernel (specifically Loadable Kernel Modules). When a device is needed, its extension is loaded and 'joined' onto the kernel - in other words making the kernel larger. Monolithic kernels are problematic in that if one of these device drivers is faulty (such as if a beta graphics driver is downloaded) then because it is part of the kernel it often overrides the mechanisms put in place to deal with faulty programs (see above). This can mean that the kernel - and thus the entire computer - can cease to function. If there are too many devices, the kernel can also run out of memory - causing a system crash or making the computer very slow. Microkernels are a way of solving this problem. In a microkernel operating system, the kernel deals only with critical activities - such as controlling the memory and CPU - and nothing else. Drivers and other functions that monolithic kernels would normally do within the kernel are moved outside the kernel, where they are under control. Instead of being an uncontrollable part of the kernel the beta driver is therefore no more unlikely to cause a crash as a beta web browser - that is, if a driver goes wrong it can simply be restarted by the kernel. Unfortunately, creating microkernel based operating systems is very difficult and there are no operating systems like these that are commonly used. Minix is a microkernel operating system.",Easy
"Ikhtiyar ud-Din Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji was a medieval military commander associated with the Delhi Sultanate in the early 13th century. While details of his early life are not extensively documented, he rose to prominence during a tumultuous period in Indian history marked by political changes and military conquests. The exact details of Bakhtiyar Khilji's early life, including his birthdate and place of origin, remain unclear. He is believed to have been a Turkic noble, possibly from the Khilji tribe, and emerged as a military leader in the service of the Delhi Sultanate. In 1206, after the death of Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the founder of the Delhi Sultanate, Bakhtiyar Khilji, was appointed as the governor of the Bengal region. This position granted him significant authority and autonomy in managing the affairs of the eastern territories. Bakhtiyar Khilji is most renowned for his military campaigns in the Bengal region. In 1204, he launched an expedition to conquer Bihar, and subsequently, he expanded his conquest to encompass the entire Bengal territory. The conquest included the sacking of Nabadwip, an important essential and educational center. Bakhtiyar Khilji's conquest of Nabadwip is a notable event in his biography. Nabadwip was known for its rich cultural and religious heritage, and its fall marked a significant turning point in the region's historical act. Circumstances of the conquest are debated among historians, and some accounts suggest the destruction of the renowned Buddhist center of Vikramashila as part of this campaign. Bakhtiyar Khilji's legacy is largely primarily military exploits and the expansion of the Delhi Sultanate into the eastern territories. However, his role in the destruction of cultural and religious sites has been a subject of historical controversy and debate. Details about Bakhtiyar Khilji's later years, including the circumstances of his death, are not well-documented. His impact on the political landscape of the Delhi Sultanate and the territories under his control, particularly Bengal, left a lasting imprint on the region's history.",Easy

Finland has a population of 5.5 millions inhabitants, most of them concentrated in the southern regions of the country. The northern regions are sparsely populated. The population density (approximately 16 inhabitants per square kilometre) is the lowest in the European Union. In Finland, most of people speak Finnish as their mother tongue (nearly 90% of the population), but there is an important minority of people having Swedish as their mother tongue (5.3% of the Finnish population). Also Finland is one of the Scandinavian countries. The area now known as Finland was settled at the latest around 8500 BC during the Stone Age. The settlers came from the areas of today's Estonia and Russia. Sweden established its official rule of Finland in the 13th century. Swedish became the dominant language of noble people and used in education. The Finnish famine of 1866–1868 killed 15 percent of the population, making it the last and one of the worst famines in European history. On September 17, 1809 Finland Became part of Russia, On December 6, 1917 Finland declared its independence. During World War II, Finland fought the Soviet Union twice and lost large parts of its territory. During the next 40 years Finland remains neutral and continued to trade with the Soviet Union and western countries. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Finland tried to build relationships with former Soviet republics and Europe. Finland joined the European Union in 1995 and started using the euro as its official currency in 2002. The area of Finland totals 338,145km2. Finland has over 187,000 lakes and 179,000 islands. Lake Saimaa is the 5th largest lake in Europe. Most of Finland is low-lying ground with occasional hills. The country's largest mountain is Halti at 1324 metres and is located in the extreme north. Thick forests cover about 74 percent of Finland making it the European Union's most forested country. Wildlife includes bear, wolf, lynx, and Arctic fox. Summer days in Finland are long and cool and winter days are short and cold. During summer, daylight lasts as long as 19 hours a day in the far south and 24 hours a day in northern parts. In winter, the sun does not rise above the horizon for 51 days in the northern parts of the country. The population of Finland is about 5,400,000. Most of the population in Finland are natives. They make up about 93 percent of the population. The other major ethnic group are the Swedish. The national languages of Finland are Finnish and Swedish. Most people are Christian. The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland is the national church. More than 85 percent of the population are members of the church. Education in Finland is free and required between the ages of 7 and 16. In international surveys the education system in Finland usually rates as the best of second-best education results in the world. Finland is well known for technological and innovative companies such as Nokia phones and the Angry Birds series of video games. Almost everyone who lives in Finland is literate. Because Finland is a big country with few people, it has many large national parks. Tourists are attracted to Finland by the capital, Helsinki, the lakes, forests and the northern area known as Lapland. Commercial Baltic cruises which visit other Baltic cities like Tallinn, Stockholm and Gdansk regularly bring tourists to Helsinki. Even though the sea freezes during the winter shipping continues as normal because of ice-breaking ships. Finland has 7 World Heritage Sites (including those which are in other countries as well as Finland) including Suomenlinna, an island fortress in the bay in front of Helsinki. Suomenlinna is popular with tourists all-year-round and residents of Helsinki enjoy taking the short ferry to the island for picnics and the chance to escape from city life.

"Crêpe Suzette is a French dessert. It consists of paper-thin crêpes, an orange flavored butter, a sauce of caramelized sugar, butter, orange juice, and zest, and an orange flavored liquor. The dish is usually flamed. The origin of the dish is disputed, but it was well known in the late 19th century. One legend says the dish was created in 1895 at the Maitre at the Café de Paris in Monte Carlo for the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII, and his guest, a beautiful French girl named Suzette. Fourteen year old waiter Henri Charpentier was waiting on the Prince's table and recalls in his autobiography: ""It was quite by accident as I worked in front of a chafing dish that the cordials caught fire. I thought it was ruined. The Prince and his friends were waiting. How could I begin all over? I tasted it. It was, I thought, the most delicious medley of sweet flavors I had ever tasted. I still think so. That accident of the flame was precisely what was needed to bring all those various instruments into one harmony of taste . . . He ate the pancakes with a fork; but he used a spoon to capture the remaining syrup. He asked me the name of that which he had eaten with so much relish. I told him it was to be called Crêpes Princesse. He recognized that the pancake controlled the gender and that this was a compliment designed for him; but he protested with mock ferocity that there was a lady present. She was alert and rose to her feet and holding her little skirt wide with her hands she made him a curtsey. 'Will you,' said His Majesty, 'change Crêpes Princesse to Crêpes Suzette?' Thus was born and baptized this confection, one taste of which, I really believe, would reform a cannibal into a civilized gentleman. The next day I received a present from the Prince, a jeweled ring, a panama hat and a cane."" One legends says it was named in honour of French actress Suzanne Reichenberg (1853–1924), who worked professionally under the name Suzette. In 1897 at the Comédie Française, she played a maid preparing crêpes. It was decided to flame the dish to keep it warm for the actors who were about to eat it. Several crêpes are spread with an orange juiceorange zest butter. The crêpes are folded into fourths and arranged in a chafing dish filled with a warm orangebutter sauce.

"The Snowshoe hare (scientific name: Lepus americanus) is a hare. It lives in North America as far as Alaska. Snowshoe hares are well adapted to snow. They have large feet, which allow them to walk on snow. The snowshoe hare is sometimes called the snowshoe rabbit, but it is a real hare, and not a rabbit. Its fur changes with the season: brown in summer, it turns white in winter to camouflage itself in the snow. It is very similar to the Arctic hare, which lives in Arctic regions, and the Mountain hare, which lives in the mountains.",Easy

"Vasco da Gama (1460 or 1469?-December 24, 1524) was a Portuguese sailor. He was the first European who went to India through the Cape of Good Hope, the southern end of Africa. He went to India three times by ship. He was born in Sines, Portugal. His exact date of birth is unknown. According to some people's accounts, he was a knight in the 1490s at Sines. On July 8, 1497 he left Lisbon with four ships: the São Gabriel, the São Rafael, the Berrio, and a storage ship of unknown name. He intended that his ships sail to India. No European explorer before him had sailed further than the place that is now called South Africa. Vasco da Gama sailed around the bottom of the African continent. Da Gama's crew gave the South African coast they were passing the name Natal, a word which means ""Christmas"" in Portuguese. They did this because they sailed near to that coast at at the same time they celebrated Christmas. The coast they named is still called Natal. By January, Da Gama's crew had reached modern-day Mozambique, on the East African coast. Mozambique was controlled by Arabs because it was part of the Indian Ocean's network of trade. An angry crowd discovered that da Gama's men were not Muslims, so the crew continued north to Kenya. There, at Malindi, da Gama hired a pilot from India. The pilot brought the Portuguese men to the city of Calicut on the southwest coast of India on May 20, 1498. Vasco da Gama was in danger because of a conflict with the ruler of Calicut. However, he escaped and returned to Portugal in September 1499. A few of his Portuguese sailors stayed in Calicut. Vasco da Gama went on his next trip in 1502, after he found out that the people of Calicut had killed the Portuguese he had left behind. During this trip, he attacked and stole from all the Arab and Indian ships he found in the Indian Ocean. Then he went on to Calicut and took over that city and captured much wealth. This made the King of Portugal very happy with him. Vasco da Gama went on one last trip in 1524, to be the viceroy (governor) of Calicut, which was now a Portuguese colony.

"Immigration is the process of people settling down in a region other than their region of origin, as seen from the point of view of the destination region.

"Player Unknown's Battleground (PUBG or PubG) is an online multiplayer Battle Royale created and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game is based on previous modes created by Brendon ""Player Unknown"" Green, inspired by Battle Royale to use other games, and expanded to a separate game under Brendon Green. In the game, a hundred players have to parachute on an island and fight among themselves with different weapons to survive. Weapons and equipment have to be collected from different places on the map. The size of the safe zone on the map tends to get smaller over time, allowing players to meet and fight each other. The one who fights among himself as the last man standing is the winner. The game was released for Microsoft Windows in March 2016 through Steam's advance access beta program, and was fully released on December 20, 2017. That same month, the game was released by Microsoft Studios for Xbox One under its Xbox Game Preview program. A few months later, it was localized and released by Tencent Games in China, where two mobile versions based on the game were released for Android and iOS. As of June 2018, it is one of the best-selling games of all time, with nearly 50 million sales on all platforms. Also, the Windows version tops Steam at the same time in terms of the number of players playing the game, which is the all-time high of this platform. PUBG has received a number of positive reviews from critics both during its first access and final release; Critics have found that when the game is not fully finished and there are some technical glitches, PUBG introduces a new type of gameplay that can be played by players of any skill and is a game worthy of replay. Among other accolades, the game has received several Game of the Year nominations, and Green has been considered by Royal War Games as the defining game in the world. Many other video games, in continuation of PUBG's success, have added combat royal style mode, moreover multiple clones were initially created outside of China. PUBG Corporation has organized a number of small competitions and introduced in-game equipment to help viewers broadcast the game, so that they would like to become a popular sport. PUBG is a player vs. player action game where 100 players fight in Battle Royale, a large-scale Last Man Standing match is held, where players continue to fight to the end. Each match begins with a parachute landing on a map measuring approximately 6 × 8 km (5.0 × 5.0 m). The flight path of the plane is at different places on the map depending on the match, players need to land on the ground by parachute in a quick and accurate place. Even if the players have customized their clothes from the east, it does not affect the game. Once they land, players can search buildings and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor and other equipment. These items are effectively distributed across the map at the start of a match, especially in high-risk areas where there is usually good equipment. Kill other players as well as acquire their gears (equipment). Players can also play from a first person or third person perspective. Each has its own advantages as well as disadvantages in war and situational awareness. Every few minutes, the playable area on the map begins to shrink to an irregular position, the amount of damage (damage) increases if any player is out of the safe zone, and the player is eliminated if the safe zone is not entered in time.; In the game, players see the border as a flashing blue wall that moves over time. As the amount of safe zones on the map gradually decreases, the chances of encounters between players increase. During the match, red and bomb blasts are highlighted in unspecified areas of the map, posing a threat to players in that area. In both cases, players are warned a few minutes before the incident, provided their safety replacement is provided. Randomly, a plane flies to different parts of the playable map and drops various necessary equipment through a loot package, which is not available during normal gameplay. These packages emit highly visible red smoke, attracting interested players closer to it and making players more exposed. On average, a full round takes no more than 30 minutes. At each round completed, players gain in-game currency based on how long they have survived fighting, how many players they have killed, and how much damage other players have suffered. Coins are used by players to purchase a variety of items, including decoration items for character or weapon customization. A rotating ""event mode"" was added to the game around March 2016. These events change the rules of normal play, such as the placement of large teams or squads, or the distribution of weapons and armor throughout the game map.",Easy
"The Sri Lankan elephant (scientific name: Elephas maximus maximus) is an Asian elephant (scientific name: Elephas maximus). It is one of the three subspecies of the Asian elephant. The other two subspecies are the Indian elephant (scientific name: Elephas maximus indicus) and the Sumatran elephant (scientific name: Elephas maximus sumatranus). The Sri Lankan elephant is the largest of the three subspecies. They are about 11ft tall, and can weigh up to 12,000lb. They eat leaves, shrubs, grasses, and other plants. These elephants are native to Sri Lanka, and once lived far and wide over the entire island. They now live in the dry zones in the north, east, and southeast. There are many national parks where tourists may see the elephant. These elephants were always useful animals in Sri Lanka. They carried timber and participated in public events like the Procession of Buddha's Tooth. They were hugely numerous in the past and aggressively hunted. In modern times, they are protected by law. Killing one carries the death penalty. They are an endangered species because farming and other human developments are destroying their living areas. Asian elephants are usually smaller than African elephants. Females are usually smaller than males. Females may live to about 46 years; it is uncertain how long the males live. The Asian elephant's highest body point is on the head. The tip of their trunk is used like a finger. Their back is curved upward or level. Their ears are smaller than those of the African elephant. Their feet have more ""nails"" than those of African elephants. They have five ""nails"" on each front foot, and four on each back foot. Only 7% of Sri Lankan male elephants develop tusks. A tusk is a very long tooth that protrudes from the elephant's mouth. An elephant with huge tusks is called a ""tusker"". Females have short or no tusks. Sri Lankan elephants are the largest subspecies of the Asian elephant. Their shoulder height is between 6 and 11ft. They weigh between 4,000 and 12,000lb. Like humans, apes, and dolphins, they have a large and well developed brain. They are very smart. Elephants have the largest brain of all land animals. Their memory is awesome. They can remember places, people, and events from long in the past. Their skin color is darker than that of the two other Asian subspecies. They may have large patches of skin color loss (depigmentation) on ears, face, trunk, and tummy. The Sri Lankan elephant was once widespread on the island of Sri Lanka. In modern times, they mostly live in the island's dry zones of the north, east, and southeast. These are mainly dry deciduous woodland, scrub, grassland, and marshes. The elephant does not live in the island's wet zones. Some Sri Lankan elephants live in protected areas like national parks. Like the two other subspecies of Asian elephants, Sri Lankan elephants live in groups of 6 to 15 individuals that are related by blood. The group is led by a matriarch. She may be the oldest and most experienced of the females in the group. Sometimes a group will join another group to become a clan. The clan may then join another group or clan to become a herd. A mother and her babies have strong ties. Babies nurse for 2 to 5 years. All elephants in the group will help in different ways to raise and protect the babies. When males reach the age of sexual maturity, the matriarch and other members of the group will force them away. This is so these males will not mate with their relatives. The babies of such close unions will very likely be inferior babies. Some babies may even have birth defects. Young males often form bachelor groups. Males become more solitary as they grow older. Adult males join females only for mating. Males do not help in raising the babies. Sri Lankan elephants are both browsers and grazers. They walk along and eat, and sometimes they stand still and eat what they can reach around them. They eat shrubs, leaves, grasses, and vines. They sometimes raid farm gardens and eat crop plants. Baby and young elephants tend to feed mostly on different grasses. The food the Sri Lankan elephant eats is scarce in mature forests. Farming opens and clears the land though, making ideal places for elephants to find food. Adult elephants eat 300-400lb. of food per day. Asian elephants have poor digestive systems. They use less than 50% of the food they eat. They must eat hundreds of pounds of food every day to support their huge size. These elephants will eat for up to 16 hours a day to meet their need for food. They drink from 25 to 50 gallons of water every day. The elephant produces huge amounts of manure. In the wild, this manure carries and spreads undigested seeds in the elephant's diet. The manure is a source of food for insects and birds. Asian male elephants are called bulls. They reach sexual maturity around the age of 12. Between the age of 10 and 20, bulls enter an annual phase called ""musth"". This is a time when they become sexually aggressive. They will fight other males to mate with a female. Females are called cows. Once having successfully mated, a baby elephant called a calf develops in his mother's womb. He is born after an 18 to 22-month period. Twins are rare. At birth, the calf weighs about 220lb. He nurses from his mother's breasts for up to three years. Once a cow gives birth, she usually does not breed again until the first calf is weaned. This results in a birth interval of 4 to 5 years. Cows remain with their herd, but mature bulls are chased away. In the distant past, Sri Lankan elephants numbered in the hundreds of thousands. They lived in all zones of the island. They were aggressively hunted by Sri Lankans, other Asians, and Europeans. In the 19th century, a British officer was said to have killed 1,500 elephants. Other British officers held similar records. Between 1829 and 1855 alone, more than 6,000 elephants were captured and killed. In 2014, there was an estimated 4,000 elephants on Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan elephant is protected under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance of Sri Lanka (FFPO), and killing it carries the death penalty. Sri Lankan elephants are important to the economic and cultural life of Sri Lanka. Some are working elephants and are used to carry timber. These elephants are losing their jobs because tractors are replacing them. Elephants can be seen in protected areas and national parks. These elephants attract tourists. This trade improves the economy and the lives of Sri Lankans. The elephant has always been held in great cultural esteem in Sri Lanka. Rajah, a Sri Lankan elephant with tusks that nearly touched the ground, was declared a national treasure in 1985. Sri Lankan elephants participate in ceremonies, processions, and other public events. The Esala Perahera (the festival of Buddha's tooth) is held annually in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is thought to date to the 3rd century BC. Elephants lead the procession, bearing the sacred tooth. Sri Lankan elephants face the same threats to survival as other Asian elephant subspecies do. Elephant living areas in Sri Lanka are decreasing, and becoming fragmented because of forest clearing for human settlements and agriculture. This situation promotes conflicts between elephants and humans. These conflicts have led to the death of both humans and elephants, and the destruction of property. The problem is complicated by the elephant's taste for crops grown by humans such as sugar cane, bananas, and other fruits. In 1997, about 126 wild elephants were lost as a result of these conflicts. Conflict between government troops and the terrorist group, the Tamil Tigers in the northeastern region, has also put elephants at great risk.",Easy
"Swan Lake is a classical ballet based on German fairy tales. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky wrote the music. Julius Reisinger choreographed the first production. The ballet was first performed at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, Russia on 20 February 1877. It was not a great success. About 20 years after the Moscow premier, Swan Lake was revived in St Petersburg with choreography by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. This time, the ballet was a huge success. Modern productions of Swan Lake are usually based on the Petipa-Ivanov version of 1895. The Overture begins quietly with a theme called the Song of the Swans. It becomes louder, more intense, dramatic, and even threatening. Loud crashing chords in the brass are heard before the music subsides. The curtain rises on an old castle in Germany. Prince Siegfried is celebrating his twenty-first birthday with friends. The Prince's mother arrives. She tells her son he must choose a bride from six visiting princesses at a ball the next evening. She gives her son a beautiful crossbow as a birthday gift, then leaves. The Prince does not look forward to marriage. As evening falls, his guests leave. A flock of swans flies overhead. The Prince takes his crossbow, and hurries away to hunt them. At the edge of a lake, the Prince sees the swans land on the water. One comes ashore as a beautiful maiden. It is Odette. Odette tells Siegfried she is a princess under a magic spell cast by the sorcerer Rothbart. She is a swan by day and a maiden by night. Only a man who will promise to love her forever can break the spell. She will then become her true human self, and the sorcerer will die. Siegfried has fallen in love with Odette. He makes the promise. Suddenly, Rothbart appears as an owl. He orders Odette to join her sister swans at the lake shore. The following evening, the court assembles in the great hall. Prince Siegfried is expected to choose a bride. He shows little interest in the six princesses. He can think only of Odette. Suddenly, Rothbart enters the hall with a maiden who looks exactly like Odette. It is Rothbart's daughter Odile. Prince Siegfried believes it is Odette. He chooses her as his bride. Odette is seen at the window. She is weeping because Siegfried has broken his promise to love her forever. She disappears. Rothbart and Odile hurry away, laughing at Siegfried's distress. A storm arises. Thunder is heard and lightning flashes at the window. Siegfried runs from the hall to find Odette. At the lake shore, the swan maidens grieve for Odette and her terrible loss. Siegfried rushes in to beg Odette's forgiveness. She forgives him, but she must remain a swan forever. Rothbart enters and orders Odette away. She drowns herself in the lake. Rothbart dies. The storm grows. The lake overflows its banks, and Siegfried is drowned in the flood. In the heavens, the clouds part. Odette and Siegfried are seen united in love at last. The first performance was not a great success for several reasons: the principal ballerina was past her prime, the sets and dances were mediocre, and the music was conceived on a symphonic scale which the audience did not understand. Although the Moscow production was not a great success, the ballet was revived in 1895 for St. Petersburg, Russia with dances by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. It was performed in St. Petersburg's Mariinsky Theater. This time, the ballet was a great success. It quickly spread across Russia, Europe, and the United States. The principal role of the Swan Queen is one that all ballerinas want to perform. Like the role of Giselle, it is a test of a ballerina's technical, artistic, and dramatic powers.",Easy

"Farming or agriculture is growing crops or keeping animals by people for food and raw materials. Agriculture started at least 10,000 years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is. The development of farming gave rise to the Neolithic Revolution whereby people gave up nomadic hunting and settled in what became cities. Agriculture and domestication probably started in the Fertile Crescent (the Nile Valley, The Levant and Mesopotamia). The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, and Egypt. Wheat and barley are some of the first crops people grew. People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops, but still gathered many foods from the wild. Farming can feed many more people than hunter-gatherers can feed on the same amount of land. Agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals, but also growing other things like flowers, ornamental plants (plants people use to improve the look of their homes) and nursery plants (plants people buy to grow food on their own farms and land), manure or dung, animal hides (skins or furs), leather, industrial chemicals (starch, ethanol, and plastics), fibers (cotton, wool, hemp, and flax), fuels (methane, biodiesel, biomass), and drugs (biopharmaceuticals, marijuana, opium) Many people live by doing what is called subsistence agriculture, on a small farm. Only the farmer's family lives on the farm. Subsistence agriculture is growing only enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals. Extra food or animals are sold for money or other things the farmer cannot grow. The yield is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and the yield is often low. This is because subsistence farmers are generally less educated, and they have less money to buy equipment. When yields are low, forests are sometimes cut to provide new land to grow more food. This is good in the short term, but can be bad for the country and the surrounding environment over many years. In rich countries, farms are often much larger. The yield on farms has gotten bigger in the last one hundred years because farmers are able to grow better varieties of plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests. Many farms also use machines, which cut down on the number of people needed to farm the land. This results in fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farmers are able to eat more. This kind of intensive agriculture comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers, pesticides (chemicals that kill bugs), and herbicides (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals can pollute the soil or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by erosion (blowing or washing away), salt buildup, or loss of structure. Irrigation (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. Having fewer farmers also changes society and can make a country less able to feed itself in bad times. Farmers select plants with better yield, taste, and nutritional value. They also choose plants that are more resistant to disease, more tolerant to drought, and easier to harvest. Centuries of careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. The crops produce better yield with other techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, irrigation). It is important for there to be enough food for everyone. The food must also be safe and good. Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment. For this reason, there are several types of agriculture. Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries. Intensive agriculture is mostly done in wealthier countries. It uses pesticides, machinery, chemical fertilizers. Organic farming is using only natural products. Integrated farming is using local resources, and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process. Agricultural policy focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. At the policy level, common goals of agriculture include food security: to be sure there is enough food for everyone, enough income for the farmer to carry on with their profession and improvement of their skills and methods. There are some serious problems that face people trying to grow food. Depending on the region, these include: erosion, diseases, pests, weeds, drought ou excessive rainfall. The major crops produced in the world in 2002, are maize (corn), wheat, rice, and cotton.",Easy

"Fra Angelico (c. 1385– February 18, 1455), was an Italian Early Renaissance painter. Giorgio Vasari, who wrote the Lives of the Artists said he had ""a rare and perfect talent"". Fra Angelico has been known by many different names. When he was born, he was called Guido di Pietro. People who knew him when he was older called him Fra Giovanni da Fiesole (Brother John from Fiesole). When Giorgio Vasari wrote about him in Lives of the Artists, in the 1500s, he was already known as Fra Giovanni Angelico (Brother Giovanni who is like an Angel). The Italians usually call him il Beato Angelico (the Blessed Angelico). He has been called this for a long time, because he was thought to be blessed by God who gave him the talent of painting, and also because he was such a good and holy man. The name ""Blessed Angelico"" has now been made official, because in 1982 Pope John Paul II ""conferred beatification"" which means that he is now on the way to being made a saint. Vasari says about him: ""It is impossible to think of enough good things to say about this holy father, who was so humble and modest in everything that he did and said, and whose pictures were painted with such cleverness and holy faith."" Fra Angelico was born in Mugello near Fiesole in Tuscany, Italy probably about 1385–87 and died in Rome in 1455. Nothing is known about his parents. He was baptized Guido or Guidolino. In 1407, he joined the Dominican Order at Fiesole. In 1423, when he became officially a friar, he changed his name from Guido to Fra Giovanni (Brother John). (People who are accepted into a holy order, usually take a new name.) Like the other ""brothers"" (friars) of the Dominican Order, he wore a white robe and a black cloak, and shaved part of his head. Fra Angelico had a brother called Benedetto who was also a Dominican friar. Fra Benedetto painted illuminated manuscripts. Fra Angelico possibly learnt to paint manuscripts as well. The convent of San Marco in Florence has several manuscript books that he is thought to have painted. He was very busy with other work at the convents where he lived, but he still found time to paint pictures, which very soon became famous. In January and February 1418, he was paid for paintings that he did in the church of Santo Stefano del Ponte. Between 1418 and 1436, Fra Angelico painted an altarpiece for the church in Fiesole, which has been damaged. Age caused the some of the paint to come off, or fade, and other artists have painted over some of Fra Angelico's work while trying to repair the paintings. The top part of the altarpiece is in the National Gallery, London. It shows Christ in Glory, surrounded by more than 250 figures, and is a large and magnificent piece of work. It has been described as one of the best works in the gallery. In 1436, a new Dominican Convent of San Marco was established in Florence in some older monastery buildings. Fra Angelico was one of the friars from Fiesole who moved to Florence. This was an important move for Fra Angelico because Florence already had a great number of artists from whom he could learn. The convent had a very wealthy ""patron of the arts"" called Cosimo de' Medici who loved to buy works of art for himself and his favourite churches. Cosimo took the largest of the friars' rooms, called cells, at the convent so that he could have a quiet place for religious thought. Fra Angelico painted a picture showing the Magi at Bethlehem on the wall of Cosimo's cell. Cosimo employed Fra Angelico to paint more pictures for the convent. All the cells for the friars were built upstairs around the sides of a square courtyard with a garden in the middle (called a cloister). On the wall at the top of the stairs, Fra Angelico painted a fresco of the Angel Gabriel announcing the birth of Jesus to the Blessed Virgin Mary. This is one of his most famous pictures. Fra Angelico then began to paint a picture in each of the monk's cells. Each cell has large picture with a round top on the wall beside the window. At least six of these paintings were done be by Fra Angelico, and others were done by artists who copied his style of painting. These pictures were to help the friars with their prayers. In 1439, he finished one of his most famous works, which is the altarpiece for San Marco's Church, which is where the friars worship. It shows the Madonna and Child on a throne, surrounded by saints from different dates, who are all grouped together as if they were standing in a room in Heaven, talking about holy things. This type of painting called a ""Sacred Conversation"" later became very popular, but this is one of the first ones. In 1445, Pope Eugenius IV sent a message for Fra Angelico to come to Rome to paint the frescoes of the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament at St Peter's. The chapel was later demolished by Pope Paul III to make way for the new St.Peter's Basilica and Fra Angelico's work was lost. Vasari says that one of the popes (it might have been Eugenius or Pope Nichoas V) asked Fra Angelico if he would like the very important job of Archbishop of Florence. But Fra Angelico did not want such a high job and he suggested the name of another friar for the position. In 1447 Fra Angelico went to the city of Orvieto with his pupil, Benozzo Gozzoli, to paint some pictures for the Cathedral there . One of his other pupils was called Zanobi Strozzi, but he did not become as famous as Benozzo. From 1447 to 1449, Fra Angelico was back at the Vatican, where Pope Nicholas V had built a small chapel where he could pray privately. The pictures that Fra Angelico and his pupils painted there are the lives of two young saints St. Stephen and St. Lawrence, who were both ""martyrs"" (they were killed because of their Christian faith). The small chapel, with its bright colours and gold leaf decorations is like a jewel box. From 1449 until 1452, Fra Angelico was back at his old convent of Fiesole, where he was the Prior (the head man). Fra Angelico's pupils were probably left in Rome to finish the work on the chapel. In 1455, Fra Angelico went back to Rome, probably to look at the work in Pope Nicholas' Chapel. He died at the Dominican Convent and was buried in the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Pope John Paul II beatified Fra Angelico on October 3, 1982, making him officially known as the ""Blessed Angelico"". In 1984 the pope made him the patron of Catholic artists. Fra Angelico never wanted to be important, and even though he was so talented he never put himself above other people. He thought his most important job was caring for others. He always prayed before he picked up his brushes to paint, and he never made any changes to his pictures later, because he believed that the Holy Spirit was guiding him. He painted a great number of scenes of the Crucifixion and he would always cry while he was painting them. The words on his grave say: Fra Angelico was working at a time when the style of painting was in a state of change. The changes had begun a hundred years before his time with the works of Giotto. Fra Angelico would have seen the famous pictures of the ""Life of Saint Francis"" that Giotto did for the church of Santa Croce in Florence. In Giotto's paintings the figures look more real and solid and lifelike than in the pictures of other painters of the 1300s. Giotto was also very good at painting the emotions on peoples faces and the actions that showed how they were feeling. His work was a big influence on every artist who saw it. At the same time, rich patrons like Cosimo de Medici liked to show off their wealth. They often did this by ordering paintings that had lots of bright colour and real gold backgrounds. The red colour called ""vermilion"" was one of the most expensive. But the most expensive colour was a beautiful blue made by grinding up a semi-precious stone called Lapis lazuli. This type of painting is called ""International Gothic"". Some artists of Fra Angelico's day were expert at doing paintings that would make very rich people happy. But other painters, like Masaccio were followers of Giotto and painted in a very plain way. Fra Angelico was able to paint in both ways. If the Pope or a rich family wanted an altarpiece or a fresco that had gold and expensive bright colours, then Fra Angelico could do it. But his most famous paintings have no gold and no bright colours. They are the simple gentle paintings of the life of Jesus that he did for the friars in their cells at San Marcos. This gallery shows stories from the life of Jesus. The square paintings are in tempera. They are all parts of a big altarpiece and are about 25cm wide. The ""tondo"" (round painting) is a small altarpiece about 1.4 metres wide. All the paintings with arched tops are frescos and were painted for the Dominican brothers.

Our planet, the Earth, our star, the Sun, with its Solar System, with all its planets, and even every star that can be seen with naked eye belong to our galaxy, called the Milky Way. It is hard to figure what the Milky Ways looks like because we are inside it... The closest galaxy from ours is called Andromeda. It is seen as only a tiny point with a naked eye but can be more clearly distinguishable with a telescope. We presume that the Milky Way looks like a spiral, like Andromeda. When one looks in a certain direction, so many stars from the galaxy can be seen that only a bright ribbon can be distinguished. The Ancient Greeks called it the Milky Way because of its light color, that looked like a path made of milk. Powerful telescopes have permitted to discovered many galaxies, with various shapes, in the Universe: NGC 1300, a barred spiral galaxy.

"Belize (formerly British Honduras) is an independent country in Central America – a Kingdom (a Commonwealth realm) with the head of State Queen Elizabeth II – and borders with Mexico in the Northwest and Guatemala to the South and West. To the East, it borders the Caribbean Sea. The country is a member of the British Commonwealth. The country has little height differences. The Philip Goldson International Airport is about 15 km north of Belize City. In the country are English (official), Spanish, Q'eqchi ', Mopan, and Yucatec Maya, Plautdietsch Garifuna spoken. The country is located on the Caribbean Sea and has a number of Islands, including Ambergris Caye, Caye Caulker, and the Turneffe Islands. Most of the Islands (but not the largest island Ambergris Caye) are coral islands. The country was for the arrival of the Spaniards inhabited by Mayans. In the 17th century, the area was colonized by British timber traders and pirates. It was as a British-Honduras formally a British colony in 1840, even though it was claimed made by Mexico and Guatemala. Hurricane Hattie in 1961 brought a lot of damage in Belize. The Government decided that having a capital below sea level was too risky. After a few years was the new capital city Belmopan, designed in the exact geographical center of the country. In the 1970s, with the move of government buildings started. In 1964 British Honduras got internal self-government and Belize in June 1973 it got the name. The effective authority, however, remained in the hands of the Governor from Great Britain. The people's United Party, led by George Cadle Price, was the leader of the independence movement. On 21 September 1981, after delays because of territorial disputes with Guatemala, Belize became independent from the United Kingdom. The new State border disputes remained common. There remained even, to protect, a British garrison behind. It took until 1991 before Guatemala recognized Belize. To date, however, there is a border dispute between the two countries.

"Denmark is a country in northern Europe. It shares a border with Germany and is connected to Sweden by a road and rail bridge. Denmark is a member state of the European Union and part of the Scandinavian countries. Denmark consists of a mainland and hundreds of islands. The capital city is Copenhagen. Other big cities in Denmark are Århus and Odense. Denmark has been a member of the European Union since 1973 and uses the Danish Krone as its currency. People have lived in Denmark since around 12,500 BCE. Over time the original population mixed with people from other parts of Scandinavia, the British Isles (United Kingdom and Ireland) and other nearby countries. Between the 8th and 10th century CE The Vikings (the name the Danish were known as at this time) invaded, traded with, discovered and fought people in other parts of Europe and North America. The Vikings discovered North America in the 10th century - over 400 years before Christopher Columbus (see Vinland). In later centuries Denmark was associated with neighbouring countries and there was for many hundreds of years a union between Denmark, Sweden and Norway. During World War II Denmark was occupied by Germany while its main colonies of Greenland and Iceland were occupied by the British and the USA. After the war Iceland became an independent country. Denmark has been a member of the European Union since 1973 joining at the same time as the UK and Ireland. Denmark has thousands of islands including 443 which are named. Denmark is a very flat country and its highest mountain is Møllehøj, at 171 metres. Because of Denmark's indented coast and thousands of islands, Denmark has a coastline of over 7,300 kilometres. The climate in Denmark is temperate and the country experiences cold winters and cool summers. The Øresund Bridge connects the island of Zealand (where the capital is located) with Sweden measuring almost 8km in total. No location in Denmark is more than 52km from the sea. Over 5.8 million people live in Denmark. The majority of people in Denmark are of Danish descent, but there are small minorities from South Asia and the Middle East. Inuit people from Greenland and people from the Faroe Islands (both territories are possessions of Denmark) also exist in Denmark. The national language is Danish. Around 75-80% of the population are members of the Church of Denmark, which is a Lutheran Christian church and the official religion of Denmark. Many members of the Church of Denmark are not religious, but choose to stay in the church because it takes time to leave and because the only downside to being a member is that you have to pay a small church tax. For this reason, many people stay in the Church of Denmark but are atheist or even member of another religion. About 20% of Danish people say they are atheist. 3% are Muslims, 0.7% are Catholic Christians, and 0.1% are Jews. The most popular sports in Denmark are Association football (soccer), handball, sailing, and badminton. Handball was invented in Denmark. Like many other countries in northern Europe, Denmark is a monarchy. The present monarch is Queen Margrethe II, who has been on the throne since 1972. In her annual address to the people of Denmark, on New Year's Eve 2023, Her Majesty announced her intention to abdicate the throne on 14th January 2024, and give it to her son, Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark . As is customary in the country, there will be no public coronation, but more simply, Crown Prince Frederik's accession to the throne as King, will be announced publicly to the nation. Denmark is a popular destination for tourists and is very popular for short trips for visitors from Sweden, Norway, Germany and the United Kingdom.

"The Liberal Party of Canada is a social liberal party in Canada. It was founded in 1867, and is sometimes called ""Canada's natural governing party"" as it lead the country for 69 years throughout the 20th century. During the 20th century, it competed with the Progressive Conservative party, but in the 1990s, the Reform Party of Canada was created, which was made up of people who were further to the right then the PCs. The Reform Party then became the Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance, in 2000, only to be forced to change its name because it has the unfortunate acronym of ""CCRAP"". The Reform Alliance dominated Western Canada during the late 90s and in 2000, while the PCs remained the dominant opposition to the Liberals in Ontario and other provinces, allowing the Liberals to remain in power. The two parties merged in 2004, and the Liberals lost the 2006 election due to vote-splitting among the centre-left between the Liberals, the New Democrats, and the Greens.

"The Sumerians lived in Mesopotamia around 4000 BC. Mesopotamia or ""the Fertile Crescent"" was a region in the Middle East between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, in the territory of modern Iraq, Iran and Syria. Ancient Sumeria was very small: it occupied only a narrow stretch of this territory, where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers reach the Persian Gulf. Their territory was mostly inside the modern-day borders of Iraq, with small stretches of land in Kuwait, Iran and Arabia. Sumerian traders are known to have sailed down the Gulf as far as modern-day Qatar and Bahrain, and to have traveled upstream to Haran, in the neighborhood of the modern-day cities of Mosul and Tikirit. Since the land between these two rivers was very fertile, people first started practising agriculture (farming), there. Sumer became home to the first civilizations and cities. In the beginning these cities were independent, each city being a state or nation of its own. Each city had its own king, laws, gods, and calendar. The biggest cities were Eridu, Kish, Lagash, Uruk, Ur, and Nippur. The rulers of these cities led constant wars The Sumerians built houses, palaces and temples using mud bricks. Good stone is not found in the Euphrates delta, so it had to be transported at great expense over long distances. Small quantities of precious stone would be used to cover the brick in places, but most Sumerian buildings were brick. Sumerians made bricks by scooping wet mud into a wooden frame. The bricks would be all of the same size, but slightly rounded on top. The Sumerians preferred low, wide bricks to the standard shape we use today. Sunshine would evaporate most of the water from the brick, which hardened. Builders only rarely fired their bricks to make them totally hard. This meant that heavy rains and floods would usually destroy Sumerian buildings. Fired bricks would be decorated with paints or glazes, and assembled to form pictures on walls. Sometimes the Sumerians covered walls of brick with an added layer of mud, into which they would push cones of colored clay to decorate walls. The most famous type of Sumerian architecture was the Ziggurat. Ziggurats were many-storied structures like pyramids, or wedding cakes. Each layer was square, with a smaller layer built on top. Stairs on the outside of the ziggurat led up the sides to the top of the building. This put the top platform of the ziggurat high in the air. There the Sumerian priests put temples to their gods. It is possible they also watched the movements of the stars from observatories there, built very high on a platform of mud brick. On these large platforms were built smaller and smaller platforms, creating a pyramid shape. Originally they were made out of mud brick but Ziggurats from later times were made out of fired bricks, which were glazed and adorned with pictures or faced with stone carvings. Most people's houses did not look like this. They were simple mud brick huts, similar to those found all over the Middle and Near East. Many of them had courtyards at the center, with chambers for eating and working on the main floor, and rooms for sleeping either at the back or upstairs. We do not know what the roofs of these houses were like, but we can guess. They were built of heavy sticks set into the wall in one direction, and lighter sticks laid over them in another direction, and covered with a layer of mud. As Sumerians were mostly agricultural people, they ate what they farmed: wheat, barley, lentils, beans, garlic, onions, milk and milk products. They made bread and beer from grains. Meat, usually from goats or sheep and occasionally cattle, was probably rare in their diets; the animals were too expensive to kill. They ate apples and other kinds of foods. Records of ancient Sumerian laws show that oxen — cattle bred, de-horned and neutered for work — were valuable but potentially dangerous animals. When they escaped, they did damage to fields and sometimes injured or killed people. Sheep and goats were probably more common. The wool and leather from the animals was also useful, because it could be turned into clothing or armor or tools. Their clothing was mostly made out of wool and flax. flax is a plant with blue flowers. the stem of flax was used in making the clothing. clothing was also made out of other products they could grow themselves. The men of Sumer often had long hair with a parting in the middle. Many had long beards as well, although some men preferred to be clean-shaven. The mens attire consisted of long skirts and no shirts. woman wore floor-length gowns that covered the left shoulder. The right shoulder and arm were left bare. Sumerian women also wore their hair long. Most women would braid their locks into one long braid which they then wrapped around the top of their heads. when there were guests around women would wear a headdress. princesses wore bright colored clothes and expensive jewelry made out of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and carnelian. heavier clothing was worn in the winter and lighter clothing was worn in the summer. social status was determined by the quantity and quality of jewelry and clothing a person owned but they did not need a lot of clothing because of where they lived (in a warm, dry climate). Sumerians were the first to invent writing. They wrote with sharpened sticks made of reed – a plant that grows on the banks of rivers. One of these sticks is called a stylus. When you push this kind of pen into a tablet of raw clay, you’ll get lines that look like wedges: thicker on one side, thinner on the other. That is why their writing is called Cuneiform, which means ""wedge-shaped"". Writing consisted of small pictures. At first, these pictures were drawn into the clay with the stylus. There was a different picture for each word. That meant that a person had to know thousands of these pictures to read and write. Only very educated people, called scribes, were able to read and write. The scribes found drawing pictures to be very hard even in smooth wet clay, so they invented standard ways to combine wedges to form the pictures. After many centuries, they created very quick combinations of wedges that formed the pictures. Children went to schools to learn how to be scribes. They began by reciting prayers to their gods and promises to their teachers to study hard and learn well. Then they learned to shape clay into many kinds of tablets — rounded squares for legal contracts, and large oblongs for poetry, and cylinders or prisms for royal decrees. They also copied out word lists — rows of symbols that belonged to specific categories, like the names of kings, and the words for different kinds of jobs, and words for different products available in the markets of the city. The teachers used sticks to beat slow learners, but also gave special tutoring to the students of parents who paid extra. After learning many words, scribes practised making whole documents by copying out famous laws, poems and songs. This made them fast and accurate scribes. Scribes wrote numbers with the back end of the stylus, and used different symbols for 1, 5, 10, 20, and 60. So the number ""157"" would be written with two 60s, a 20, a 10, a 5 and two 1s (60+60= 120 + 20 = 140 + 10 = 150 + 5 = 155 + 1 +1 = 157). Scribes could add and subtract. Some seem to have known how to multiply and divide, but most did not. Highly trained scribes appear to have known some geometry and some astronomy, but the Sumerians did not have an accurate calendar. Sumerians had many gods. An was the god of the sky, Enki the god of water, Enlil the god of air, Ki the goddess of the earth, Inanna the goddess of fertility and many more. Plus, they had lots of local deities; each town had its own. The sky god An was very important, but not always very smart. In one story, he decided to destroy all humans one day, because their noise was tremendous and it kept him awake. An ordered Enki to send a flood to destroy everyone, and Enki did so. But An had forgotten that people give the gods sacrifices of food, drink, and incense. Because of this, the gods nearly starved because An was upset about a little noise. Fortunately, a Sumerian named Utnapishtim had gotten warning of the flood from Enlil, the god of air. Enlil told Utnapishtim to build a boat, and sail away on the flood with useful plants and animals in the boat. The old Sumerian man had done so, and when the flood waters receded, he sacrificed to the gods. The food revived An and the others, and they recognized their folly at last. Never again, they promised, would they try to wipe out humans. A version of this story is recorded in the Hebrew Bible, which is repeated in the Christian Bible. The Sumerians began as a series of powerful city-states. Each city had its own god and looked after itself and ruled the surrounding countryside. They fought each other as well as made alliances. This culture lasted from about 2900 - 2400 BC. They had a very distinct culture and their style of architecture, writing and religion spread throughout the Middle East. The Akkadians settled North of Sumer along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and copied many of the Sumerians' ideas. Later on, one of the Akkadian kings, Sargon I conquered all the city states of Sumer and Akkad and created the world's first empire. His reign lasted about 60 years (2371 - 2316 BC) and his empire stretched from the coast of Lebanon to Iran. When Sargon died, his empire broke up and the Sumerians and Akkadians were invaded by other groups of tribesmen from the mountains. After this, the dominant forces in the Middle East were the Babylonians and Assyrians. These two civilizations were descendents of the Akkadians who had ruled over the whole area, but they split into separate empires. The Assyrians were in the North and the Babylonians were in the South. The Sumerians as a people no longer existed, though their writing, architecture and religion influenced the civilizations in this area for centuries after. They had over 100 gods. The most famous of Sumerians is Gilgamesh, legendary king of Uruk. He is known due to the Epic of Gilgamesh, a collection of Sumerian legends, later translated and written down in Akkadian. It tells about the adventure of Gilgamesh, his friendship with Enkidu, a wild man raised by animals, and his journey to obtain the secret of immortality. In the Epic, Gilgamesh is portrayed as a young king full of arrogance and pride. Gilgamesh is a bully, and has no friends. The gods are worried because Gilgamesh is so unkind to his people, so they send Enkidu, a wild man every bit Gilgamesh's equal, to be his friend. When they meet each other, Gilgamesh starts a fight, but he discovers that Enkidu is so strong that he cannot win; but Enkidu discovers the same thing about Gilgamesh. As soon as they have tired each other out, without one or the other winning, they become fast friends. Enkidu teaches Gilgamesh kindness, while Gilgamesh teaches Enkidu to be civilized. Both grow up to be very handsome. Gilgamesh decides he needs a tree for the roof of his palace, so he proposes a quest to the cedar forest to cut down a tree. Enkidu is horrified and warns Gilgamesh of the terrifying monster Humbaba who guards the forest. Gilgamesh manages to persuade his friend to go anyway, and they go on the quest in search of the tree. Together they meet and kill the monster, and chop down the tree. But the death of Humbaba makes the gods angry. Further, the goddess Inanna sees Gilgamesh and wants him for her husband. But Gilgamesh tells her that she has already had too many husbands, and she has used them all up — she even kills them when she tires of them! Gilgamesh prefers being a bachelor, thank you. Angered, Inanna persuades her father to release the Bull of Heaven in Uruk, to destroy Gilgamesh and his people. The Bull runs wild in the streets, for to touch it is death. Many are slain by the touch of the Bull, its horns or its flanks or its tail. Enkidu and Gilgamesh go out to destroy the Bull, and they succeed in killing it. But the Bull manages to touch Enkidu, who sickens and dies. Gilgamesh is heartbroken, and refuses to let anyone care for the body or bury his friend. He delays so long that maggots begin falling out of Enkidu's eye sockets and nostrils. Finally, Gilgamesh consents to the burial of his friend, but he cannot bear the thought of dying himself. His mother tries to console him and tell him that death is normal, but the king of Uruk will not hear it. He resolves to go to the ends of the earth in search of a cure for dying — a way to become immortal. He faces many perils on his trip. First he travels through the tunnel that the Sun uses when traveling underneath the earth. He enters it at sunrise, and races to the other end, hoping to get out before the hot sun comes in at sunset, and burns him alive. He makes it, but then he must confront the scorpion monster. However, the scorpion monster's wife tells her husband to leave the human alone, he is so tired. The scorpion monster allows Gilgamesh to live, and guides him to Sudri, a woman who keeps a tavern for the gods at the end of the earth. Sudri refuses to give Gilgamesh the secret of eternal life, but the boatman offers to guide Gilgamesh to Utnapishtim, who lives forever. Together, Gilgamesh and the boatman cross the Waters of Death, though not without some trouble. The next chapters of this epic form the story of Utnapishtim, the king who saved humankind of the Great Flood. His tale is very similar to the Biblical story of Noah's Ark. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh that he cannot handle living forever, because he cannot even stay awake seven days. Despite his weariness, Gilgamesh agrees to stay awake for seven days. Mrs. Utnapishtim promises to bring Gilgamesh a loaf of bread every day so that he can eat. No sooner than she goes away to prepare the loaf for the first day, but Gilgamesh falls asleep! He sleeps all through all seven days. When he wakes, he insists to Utnapishtim that he only dozed a moment — but the seven stale and moldy loaves of bread beside him prove otherwise. Utnapishtim denies Gilgamesh the secret, and takes him back to the boatman. The boatman is sympathetic to Gilgamesh, though, and tells the king of Uruk that Utnapishtim gets his eternal life from a plant under the water. If Gilgamesh only dives into the water and brings up the plant, he will have eternal life. Gilgamesh, now thinking of home, decides to get the plant and bring it home to his royal gardens in Uruk. There, it will make everyone immortal, and the whole city will thank him. He dives into the water, retrieves the plant, and returns across the water. There, while he sleeps, a snake comes along and devours the plant. Not until he is within sight of the walls of his home city, Uruk, does Gilgamesh realize that his journey was for nothing. He weeps, but consoles himself with the knowledge that he has built a strong city which will endure long after he is dead and gone. Though Sumerians do not exist anymore, they left many technological inventions, like the wheel (which made transport easier and quicker), the potter’s wheel, baked clay, the cuneiform script, and lots of agricultural inventions: irrigation systems, agricultural tools and even beer-brewing. They may have been the first people to fit sails to boats. They made astronomical observations, and were also the first to measure time in 60-minute hours and 60-second minutes. Their priests invented clocks too, some were just like kinds of sundials and others were a type of water clock, with water dripping slowly from a pottery jar. The peasants in Sumeria were the first ones to find out how to harness animals to plows, instead of cultivating the land with hand hoes, and this allowed people to grow much more grain.

"Star History of Earth isn't the only star article → Find more of them! The History of Earth is the development of the planet where humanity lives. According to scientists, the Earth is about 4.56 billion years old (4,560,000,000 years). This age has been determined by measuring radioactive decay, a very complicated but precise way to measure how old something is. The universe itself was created 13.8 billion years ago, by the big bang. So that's three times older than the Earth. The history of the Earth is divided into parts on the geologic time scale. This scale consists of four eons, all of which are divided. The eras on this scale are based on life on Earth, the atmosphere, ice ages, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and building the Earth's crust and Earth core. We are currently in the Holocene, an era that started after the final ice age and now 11,700 years. Our Solar System was formed according to scientists from a molecular cloud, a giant cloud of hydrogen and helium, elements that were created by the big bang. There were also some heavier elements in. Those were added by supernovae, big stars that exploded with a giant strength. Such a supernova going close to the molecular cloud. The shock wave struck the solar system 4.6 billion years ago, making the cloud go around in turns and pull together. In the middle clotted a lot of molecules together. There was such high pressure that atoms even coalesced and heavier elements were. These clumping molecules formed the Sun. Meanwhile, clashed in the rest of the cloud remained heavy particles against each other and stick together. There came more and more particles, also of meteors, and this formed the planets, including the Earth. The temperature on Earth was so high that all bricks and metal fused. It seemed so not at all on the Earth by now: the Earth was a sphere lava where you could not breathe. The heavy metals sank to the bottom of the viscous mass of molten metal. This formed the core. The core is very important for the Earth: it makes for a not too cold temperature and gives the Earth a magnetic field, what deadly radiation from outer space. The Moon was born about ten thousand years after the Earth at an event that is called the giant impact. A planet, about as big as Mars, collided with the Earth. By the hit was a lot of material, plunging space, which the Moon formed. The remains of the Earth and the other planet fused together, making the Earth a lot bigger. It's not sure making the oceans were created, but it is thought that there are a whole bunch comets were explosive on Earth, which consisted of ice cream. The ice melted and filled the oceans. Meanwhile, cooled the Earth a lot. This made the lava and the Earth's crust. Light rocks came to the top and heavy stones sank. This gave rise to continents (continents). By the heat difference between the crust and the core were formed Earth plates. Volcanoes were formed by lava by the Earth's crust back broke. These volcanoes kept hitting lots of gas, which formed the first atmosphere. However, there was no oxygen at. No one knows how life on earth began and where it started. But scientists are becoming closer to a remedy. Two things seem certain: life is long ago and the first living things were much simpler than all that lives. Some people believe that living things are specially made and that life on Earth is only a few thousand years old. But virtually no scientist agrees. They think that life is nearly 4 billion years ago when the planet was young. They suspect that it started with random chemical reactions, which eventually living beings. So that might not be all gone on Earth and other planets in the Universe can also have life. Living things are incredibly varied but in the end, they use the same parts to stay alive. They are all out of cells, each of which has a full set of chemical instructions, or genes. Cells look like microscopic vesicles and are surrounded by special membranes that protect them against the outside world. They can use energy from their surroundings, multiply and grow. Genes are even more important. They contain information which is necessary for cells to do and make it work. They can copy themselves and are passed on when cells multiply. To understand how life is started and try scientists to figure out how cells and genes. Both are very complicated in structure, so it is unlikely that they happen to be ready. But maybe they themselves step by step from something very simple. In the course of a long time, random chemical reactions would be the building blocks of life may have formed. More than 50 years ago, American chemist Stanley Miller an experiment in which he mimicked the conditions on the young Earth. Through completely random comments were some of the carbon compounds found in living things. Miller's results were startling, but since then scientists have discoveries that still remarkable. Carbon compounds have been found in subway rites and comets, and even in the ' empty ' space. They are much simpler than any gene and they are definitely not living. But they are the components that make up living things exist. Recently some researchers suggested that substances from outer space life on Earth may be. There should also be living microbes from outer space. But most scientists believe that life on earth itself came to be and that it has developed gradually at sheltered places because carbon compounds were ever more varied and more complex. On the young earth were the continents ravaged by volcanic eruptions, so on the country were complex substances quickly destroyed. But the seas were less inhospitable. Fix chemicals well in sea water and they can react with one another. In the course of millions of years were chemicals with rainwater in sea flushed and had many carbon compounds accumulated. The result was a promising brew that often is called primordial soup. Mixing chemicals In the open sea itself well, intricate molecules can hardly survive. Many scientists think that the conditions on the sea floor or in holes in rocks were better. On the crystals in rocks could maybe large molecules. Possible gave dissolved minerals the energy required was to connect their atoms. Deep sea crater is rich in minerals and therefore, some think that they are the cradle of life forms. In the long period for the beginning of life produced random chemical reactions all kinds of carbon-containing molecules. Some of these molecules may be worked as catalysts, which comments thousands or millions of times accelerated. But at some point there was an extremely important event place: there appeared a molecule that could copy itself and remained alive long enough to enhance. All of the above is based on assumptions that are not to prove. But research shows that life itself then at once started was quickly through the seas. There are fossil bacteria colonies found that 3.4 billion years old. Their bloom time has long since passed but living bacteria colonies still exist though. During the long history of life, there are millions of different types emerged. But they all have the same cell membranes and their genes use exactly the same chemical code. So it is almost certain that the living beings of now a distant common ancestor, which long ago in the sea has come to life. The first living creatures were formed about a billion years after the Earth was formed. Living things have water and protein. Water was there, only proteins yet. Proteins consist of amino acids, and these existed. These amino acids to proteins that somehow grew knew how they could reproduce by splitting itself in two. How amino acids could grow we do not know. Perhaps by lightning strikes, ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, or volcanoes. The first living organisms were single-cell, just like bacteria now. We now have two of the four eons of the geologic time scale (see the introduction), the Archean and Hadean. Life developed further in the Proterozoic. This took two billion years, to 500 million years ago. At this time formed the continents further and there were some ice ages, but the most important development was multicellular life. The first living organisms were unicellular forms with only DNA. But in the Proterozoic, various organelles in the cell, all of which have a private task. These creatures were already a lot more complicated, but still single-cell. It took one and a half billion years before multicellular organisms. Also important was that in the Proterozoic oxygen in the atmosphere. There were namely blue algae that oxygen made of light. This created also the ozone. After multicellular organisms arose ended the Proterozoic, the Phanerozoic Eon started. The first part of this eon was called the Paleozoic Era and its first period the Cambrian. In the Cambrian Period came the development of new kinds of animals on a coaster. It went very fast. So fast, that we speak of the Cambrian explosion. During the Cambrian explosion the first animals with a backbone: fishing. Also gave rise to plants on the country. Before that, it was the country bare. In the rest of the Paleozoic insects, amphibians, and were the first land animals that could lay eggs (where later mammals, reptiles, and birds came out for). The Mesozoic Era was the time of the dinosaur Sen. the first birds and mammals laid eggs from animals that were formed. This era was divided in the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. During this era, the supercontinent broke Pangaea from each other towards the continents we know today. The dinosaurs were and are the largest animals ever to have walked on the Earth. At the end of the Cretaceous hit, an asteroid in the Gulf of Mexico causing the dinosaurs became extinct. When the dinosaurs were gone the mammals could evolve. They spread around the Earth and became the new dominant species. This time is called the Cenozoic Era and is the time in which. The Human Evolution is the process in which you can see how man has been developed. Sixty million years ago gave rise to the primates or great apes. Today there are still living primates, such as the chimpanzee and gorilla. Six million years ago there lived a kind of ape that is the ancestor of chimpanzees and humans. Humans and chimpanzees both arose out of this ape-like. The first true Humanoids, there were two million years ago. They walked upright, used stone tools, and had a large brain content. They got all the generic name Homo, which indicates that they are Humanoids. There lived various types of Homo like the Homo erectus and Neanderthal. Meanwhile, we're in the Stone Age and know people how they fire. They live in groups, hunting, make cave paintings, and already have a kind of language. 200,000 years ago in the Middle East the Homo sapiens, the modern human, like you and me.

For six years there were no other victories, but in 1931 Juve won its first Scudetto in a series of victories called the quinquennium of gold, in which Juventus won five consecutive championships, four of which were under the direction of Carlo Carcano and with in pink important players like the trio of Combi-Rosetta-Caligaris, Luis Monti e Raimundo Orsi. The end of this era coincided with Agnelli's death, which occurred in 1935. Then, for five years the team would not win any trophies, until they won the title in 1950. In this period, thanks to the chairmanship of the Agnelli brothers (First Gianni, then Umberto) the team went through an excellent period, winning the scudetto in 1952, 1958, 1960 and 1961, thanks to the play of the Magic Trio made up of Omar Sivori, John Charles, and Giampiero Boniperto. This was followed by a period without success, except for a championship in 1967. In 1971 Giampiero Bonipeti became president of Juventus, opening a series of victories that lasted fifteen years, in which Juventus won 9 Scudetti, two Italian Cups, and International victories that would make the club the first to win all the UEFA competitions, and later, the first to in the world to win all official club competitions. However, the Champions League victory of 1985 was marked by a tragedy that took place before the final against Liverpool: in the clash between moderate fans and hooligans (particularly violent fans) 39 people lost their lives, the majority Italian. The 90's would not be particularly successful for the bianconera, if the Coppa Italia (1990) is excluded and the two Uefa Cups (1990, 1993). However, in 1994 the Juventus supporting coach Marcello Lippi arrived, which started a series of success that would last for ten years, with the winning of five Scudettos and a Champions League in 1996. In 2004 Fabio Capello was hired as a manager, who would immediately win two consecutive titles (2005–2006), revoked by the Federal Court following the Calciopoli scandal in which fixed games were discovered. In 2006 the team was relegated to Division B as a penalty, but at the end of the season returned to A, in 2007. After four year without success, Antonio Conte became manager and Andrea Agnelli president. Under their guidance, the squad won three consecutive titles (2012, 2013, 2014), the first without suffering any defeats in the championship. After the sudden resignation of Conte before the start of the 2014-2015 season, Massimo Allegri is hired as coach.

Today, on average, girls start puberty at age 10 or 11, and boys at age 11 or 12. However, people all over the world start puberty at different ages. Changes that happen to young men and women during puberty include the sex organs growing bigger, hair appearing on the body, and growing taller and stronger. These changes are called secondary sex characteristics. People often notice young men's voices getting deeper, and young women growing breasts and starting to menstruate (have periods). Because puberty is the time in a child's life when he or she becomes able to make children, this is seen as very important. Therefore, people in many countries around the world have different ways of marking this event. Puberty is started and carried on by different hormones. Hormones are chemicals that tell parts of the body to do things. Hormones are made by glands in the body. Glands are organs (special parts) of the body that make hormones. This is what happens during puberty: On average, girls begin puberty at ages 10–11; boys at ages 11–12. Girls usually complete puberty by ages 15–17, while boys usually complete puberty by ages 16–17. The major landmark of puberty for females is menarche, the onset of menstruation, which occurs on average between ages 12–13; for males, it is the first ejaculation, which occurs on average at age 13. In rich countries in the 21st century, the average age at which children, especially girls, reach puberty is lower compared to the 19th century, when it was 15 for girls and 16 for boys. This can be due to improved nutrition resulting in rapid body growth, increased weight and fat deposition, or eating meat from animals which have been dosed up with oestrogen. This is the general picture, but people round the world may start puberty at different ages. This is because their environment (things around them) may differ quite a bit. Here are some of the things that make puberty happen at different ages in people: Girls usually reach their adult height and become sexually mature (able to have babies) about four years after puberty starts. Boys keep growing for about six years after puberty starts. Puberty in boys starts off more slowly than in girls, but then speeds up later on. Although boys are usually about 2 cm shorter than girls before puberty begins, men on average end up about 13 cm taller than women. For most boys, puberty takes about six years and ends when they are about 17 or 18 years old. At the end of puberty, a teenager is usually about 10 to 30centimetres (cm) (4 to 12inches (in)) taller, 7 to 29kilograms (kg) (15 to 65pounds (lb)) heavier, and stronger. In the meantime (even before the end of his growth), he is also able to make a woman pregnant (have a baby). The first sign of puberty in boys is that their testicles (also called the testes) and scrotum (the ""bag"" that the testicles are in) grow bigger. Before puberty, each testicle is about 1.5 to 2cm (0.6 to 0.8in) long and has a volume of about 2 to 3cubic centimetres (cc) (0.1 to 0.2cubic inches (cu in)). About six years after puberty starts, the testicles reach their adult size. The volume of an average adult man's testicle is about 18 to 20cc (1.1 to 1.2cu in). However, it is normal for some men to have testicles smaller than this size, and for other men to have larger testicles. The penis also grows bigger during puberty. At the start of puberty, the average length of the penis is 6cm (2.4in). The penis reaches adult size about five years later. A study done in 1996 found the mean length of an adult man's penis is 3.5in (8.9cm) when it is flaccid (Template:Pronounced, Template:Respelled) (not erect or hard). The average length of an erect penis is about 12.9 to 15cm (5.1 to 5.9in). The testicles have two main jobs: to make hormones and sperm. The testicles make the hormone testosterone, which spreads around the body. This causes the changes in the body that make a boy grow into a man. Testosterone also makes a man feel like having sex. One year after puberty begins, when boys urinate (pee) after waking up in the morning, some sperm can be found in the urine. When a boy is about 13 years old his testicles will have grown to the stage that he may be fertile (able to make a woman pregnant). However, it will be still be difficult for him to do so. Boys usually only become fully fertile when they reach about 14 to 16 years of age. The sperm in the testicles mixes with other liquids in the body to form a whitish or yellowish and sticky fluid called semen. During puberty, two glands in the body called the seminal vesicles and prostate also grow bigger. These glands make a lot of the liquid that is in semen. When a man is sexually excited, he gets an erection – his penis becomes bigger, longer and harder. A male can become sexually excited if thinks about sex or sees a good-looking person, or if his penis rubs against something. During puberty, some boys also have spontaneous erections. These are erections that happen by themselves without any reason. This can be embarrassing when it happens in a public place. When a man's penis is sexually stimulated for some time, he has an orgasm and semen shoots out from the penis. This is called ejaculation. Boys who have not begun puberty cannot ejaculate. A boy's first ejaculation usually happens about one year after he begins puberty. For some boys, the first ejaculation takes place when they are sleeping. This is called a nocturnal emission or a wet dream. It happens without the boy's control, often when he is having a dream about sex. Scientists believe that wet dreams are the body's way of removing too much semen. A study done of 5,300 white men in the United States in 1948 found that 13% of them had their first ejaculation through a wet dream, This seems to tell us that most boys have their first ejaculation after masturbating. A male masturbates when he rubs his penis to make himself feel good sexually. The study also found that most boys who have their first ejaculation by masturbating do this a year or more earlier than boys who have their first ejaculation through a wet dream. A 2004 survey by a magazine in Canada found that most males (43%) started masturbating when they were about 12 to 13 years old. When a boy begins masturbating, wet dreams often stop happening because semen is taken out from his body regularly. When a boy starts to ejaculate, he usually produces only a small amount of semen. The semen is different from what an adult man produces. It is usually clear and stays sticky. It either has no sperm in it, or sperm that do not move properly or do not move at all. A boy's semen only becomes like an adult man's semen about two years after his first ejaculation. Not long after a boy's testicles and penis start to grow, pubic hair (Template:Pronounced, Template:Respelled) begins to appear. Pubic hair is hair that grows in the pubic region, which is the part of the body where the penis is. Pubic hair is shorter, curlier and rougher than hair on the head. It usually starts growing on the abdomen above the penis at the place where it joins the body. (The abdomen is the part of the torso where the navel or bellybutton is.) There may also be some hair on the scrotum. After about six months to a year, there will be a large triangle of hair in the pubic region. Within three to four years after puberty begins, there is a lot of pubic hair in the area above the penis. Later on, pubic hair also grows on the abdomen upwards towards the navel and on the insides of the thighs. About two years after pubic hair starts to appear, hair also grows on other parts of the body: The hair on the arms, legs, chest, abdomen and back may also become thicker. Different men have different amounts of body hair. Many boys begin shaving when hair starts growing on their faces. A larger amount of male hormones in the body cause changes to perspiration (sweat). This gives it a more ""adult"" body odor or smell. The hormones also cause sebaceous glands in the skin to make more sebum, a type of oil that keeps the skin from getting too dry. Sebum and dead skin cells can mix with a type of germ called bacteria and block pores (tiny openings) in the skin. This causes a skin problem called acne. Most people get acne during puberty. When a person has acne, he gets swellings on his skin called blackheads, whiteheads and pimples. Blackheads and whiteheads are painless, but pimples can be red and painful. They usually form on the face but can also appear on the neck, shoulders, upper back and chest. Oil glands on scalp – the part of the head on which hair grows – also make a lot of sebum. This can cause dandruff, in which small white bits of skin fall from the scalp. During puberty, a boy's larynx or voicebox also grows larger. This makes the laryngeal prominence or Adam's apple – the lump that sticks out of the front of his neck – larger too. As the larynx grows the vocal cords become longer and thicker, so they vibrate (move back and forth) more slowly. This causes the voice to lower in pitch or tone and become deeper. When this happens, it is sometimes said that the boy's voice has ""broken"". However, it actually does not happen overnight but over some time. During this time, the voice may sound scratchy. On average, a boy's voice normally reaches its adult sound when he is around 15 or 16 years old. Towards the end of puberty, boys go through a ""growth spurt"" which lasts for about two to three years. During this time, their body grows taller very quickly. When the growth spurt is at its fastest point, some people grow 10 cm or more a year. This happens about two years after puberty starts, usually between the ages of 13 and 15. When a boy reaches the end of his growth spurt when he is about 18 years old, he will be at his adult height. His body will not grow much taller after that. Because of their growth spurt, boys' muscles can feel sore. These ""growing pains"" can feel worse if boys are active and do a lot of exercise. They go away after a while. Boys grow more slowly than girls, but for a longer time. That is why most men are taller than women. By the end of puberty, adult males have heavier bones and more muscle than females. In an average adult man, muscle makes up 50% and fat 15% of his weight. On the other hand, 40% of an average adult woman's weight is made up of muscle while 27% is made up of fat. Because men have less body fat than women, their hips do not grow bigger. Some bones like those in the jaw and shoulders grow more in males than in females. That is why males have wider faces and shoulders but narrower hips. The changes in a girl's body during puberty usually take place between the ages of eight and 18 years. Most girls will have finished puberty around the age of 15. They will have breasts and pubic hair, will menstruate (have a period) every month, and will be able to get pregnant. They will usually also have reached their full adult height. When the breasts start to grow, this is normally the first sign of puberty that can be seen on the outside of a girl's body. This usually happens when girls are about the age of 10.5 years. A lump that is a bit hard appears in each breast under the areola, which is the dark ring around the nipple. The lump in one breast may grow before the other one. This is called breast budding. Within six to 12 months, both breasts will have started growing. The swelling can be felt and seen outside the edges of the areolae. About one and a half to two years after the breasts first start growing, they are close to the shape and size of an adult woman's breasts. The nipple and areola may be on a smaller mound on each breast. This small mound usually goes away when each breast is fully grown. Whether the breasts are small or large depends on how much fat there is in the body. Between the ages of about eight and 14 (on average, at 11 or 12 years), pubic hair begins to grow along the labia (the ""lips"" of the vulva), usually a few months after the breasts start growing. At first the hair is thin and straight instead of curly, and there is not much of it. Within a year, the pubic hair becomes rough, dark and curly and grows in a triangle shape in the pubic region. About one year after pubic hair begins appearing, underarm hair also grows. The hair on the arms and legs also gets thicker, and some girls may have hair appearing on their upper lip and in front of their ears. Like boys, higher amounts of hormones in the body cause girls' perspiration (sweat) to change. This gives them a more adult body odor or smell. The hormones also cause the skin to produce more sebum (oil), which usually leads to acne. When girls are between eight and 11 years old, the two ovaries in their body begin to grow bigger. Each ovary is egg-shaped, and is attached to the side wall of the pelvis. The pelvis is a large set of bones in the hips. The ovaries are organs that make female hormones. These hormones cause a girl to grow into a woman, and make her feel like a woman. The hormones also make it possible for females to become pregnant and have babies. Inside the ovaries are about 200,000 ova (egg cells). For a baby to be formed, a woman's ovum and a man's sperm must come together. During puberty, the ova also grow bigger. Between the ages of nine and 15 years (on average, at 12 to 13 years), the vagina and uterus (womb) become bigger. The uterus is the organ in which a baby grows. The vagina is a tube leading from the uterus to the outside of the body. The opening of the vagina is inside the vulva, in between the legs. A clear or whitish fluid may start to flow out of the vagina to keep it clean. Then, about two years after the breasts start to grow, when a girl is between ten and 16 years old (on average, at 13 to 14 years), hormones made by her ovaries cause the ovaries to release an ovum, which moves into the uterus. Usually, only one ovum is released at a time. The hormones also tell the uterus to get ready for a baby, in case the ovum meets a sperm and gets fertilized. The walls of the uterus become thicker with extra tissue. Inside the thick part of the uterus are blood vessels and other nutrients that a baby will need to grow. If an ovum in the uterus gets fertilized, it sticks to the wall of the uterus and starts to grow. However, if the ovum is not fertilized, it does not stick. The uterus then gets rid of the ovum and the extra tissue by releasing it from the body. The tissue and blood flows out of the uterus through the vagina. This is called menstruation or having a period. The bleeding normally lasts for about three to five days, though some girls may bleed for longer or have a bit of bleeding between periods. The uterus then starts preparing for another ovum. For most girls, the time between their periods is about one month. For about two years after menstruation starts, the time between periods is not always the same. Some girls may skip a month, or have two periods close to each other. It is also normal to have cramps (rather painful squeezing feelings) or to feel bloated (swollen up) in the abdomen during periods. When many girls start having periods, they begin using sanitary napkins (also called sanitary pads) or tampons to soak up the blood and tissue. A sanitary napkin is a piece of material that is absorbent (able to take in liquids) which is worn between the vulva and underpants. A tampon is a stick of absorbent material that is placed inside the vagina. In 2004, a survey by a Canadian magazine found that most females (25%) started masturbating when they were about 12 to 13 years old. Because of more hormones in the body, girls start to have more fat in their breasts, abdomen, hips and thighs. At the age of ten years, the average girl has 6% more body fat than the average boy, but by the end of puberty the difference is nearly 50%. The fat makes sure that a baby growing inside a pregnant woman will have enough nutrients. Also, the bones in the pelvis move further apart to make room for a larger uterus and ovaries, and so there is space for a baby to grow in the uterus and to pass out of the body when it is born. The extra fat and wider hip bones that girls have give them a curvier shape. Girls also experience a growth spurt during puberty. In the first year after puberty begins, they grow about 8 cm. They grow even faster the next year or so, then the growth slows down and almost stops when they start menstruating. After a girl's periods begin, she usually does not grow more than 5 cm taller. The large amounts of hormones in the bodies of boys and girls during puberty can also affect their emotions. Young people begin to be attracted by (drawn to) each other and thinking about what it is like to have sex. They are often worried about what other people think about them. They can also feel an urge to do things that are dangerous, such as taking drugs or too many alcoholic drinks, or smoking. They sometimes want more independence – more power to decide things for themselves – and can get angry when their parents do not allow them to do things. The brains of teenagers are still growing, and it may take a while before they are mature enough to know how to make good choices about their lives. Therefore, it may be helpful for them to follow the advice of adults they trust, even if it does not make much sense to them at the time. Because puberty is the time in a child's life when he or she becomes able to make children, this is seen as very important. Therefore, people in many countries around the world have different ways of marking this event.",Easy

He is the lead vocalist of the rock band, U2. His parents names were Iris and Bobby Hewson. During his childhood Bono grew up in Ireland with his brother Norman. When he was fifteen years old, Paul lived a very difficult period, because his two parents died in the same year.Many fans believe that this tragic event has built his personnality. Ever since he has been involved in music; he took his inspiration from bands like Patti Smith, Thin Lizzy, The Ramones and Television. During his high school years he was nicknamed ""Bono Vox"" by his friend Guggi. At the time, it was the name of a hearing-aid store on O'Connel Street in Dublin. In school, Bono was very popular and honest. He excelled in History, chess and art ( he was a very good painter). He has also developed a passion for drama; therefore he was comfortable on the screen. One day in 1976, he answered an ad posted at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in Dublin which proposed to form a group. The metting at the home of Larry Mullen, Larry, Dave Evans (The Edge) and Adam Clayton. They formed a group that became one of the largest in the history of rock'n'roll. It's the beginning of U2. Bono writes almost all U2 lyrics, frequently using religious, social and political themes. During U2's early years, his lyrics contributed to their rebellious and spiritual tone. As the band matured, his lyrics became inspired more by personal experiences shared with other members. Outside the band he was waked (?) and recorded with numerous artists, he is also widely known for his activism concerning Africa, for which he co-founded DATA, EDUN, the ONE Campaign and Product Red. He has organized and played in several charity concerts and has met many influential politicians. Currently his most famous songs are: One, Bad, Where the streets have no name, Bloody Sunday...

"A pyramid is a structure, usually of stone, built in the shape of a pyramid. From ancient to modern times people in many different parts of the world have built such structures. The word ""pyramid"" comes from the Greek word pyramis which meant ""wheat cake."" The ancient Egyptian word for them was something like ""Mer"". The Great Pyramid of Giza was one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world. In Egypt, kings and queens, called Pharaohs, were buried in huge square-bottomed pyramids built of stone. They were usually built to be used as tombs for Pharaohs. The ancient Egyptian pyramids are very well built. Some of the pyramids still stand today. The oldest man-made pyramid found is called the Step pyramid. It is near Cairo, Egypt. It was built for King Djoser thousands of years ago. Later pyramids were built much larger. The largest one was the Great Pyramid of Giza. It was near Cairo. It was the tallest building in the world until the Eiffel Tower was built in Paris, in 1889. The Great Pyramid was built by the pharaoh Khufu (= Cheops) from the Ancient Egyptian Old Kingdom. It took twenty years to build. People thought pyramids were built by slaves. More recently evidence suggests that the workers who built the pyramids were paid and well-cared for. They were loyal to the Pharaoh. Inside the Great Pyramid, some of the most famous man-made objects have been found from ancient times. There were once many valuable items buried with the dead Pharaohs, in the hope that they would take them to the afterlife. Pyramids usually had traps to stop thieves from escaping easily. Tomb thieves were punished by death if they were caught. However, by 1000 BC, many of the pyramids had been robbed of their precious treasures. A large statue of a Sphinx stands near the pyramids at Giza. It has the body of a Lion and the head of a Pharaoh. The ancient Greeks called the great pyramid one of the seven wonders of the world. There are over 100 pyramids in Egypt. Most of them can be found on the western side of the River Nile. Some Egyptologists have different opinions on why the ancient Egyptian Kings built pyramids as their tombs. Pyramids have been excavated for about the last 200 years. The ancient Egyptians believed that the Egyptian pharaohs got launched into the stars to join their gods in the afterlife. The Aztecs and Mayans also built many massive pyramids. None are as old or big as the oldest or biggest Egyptian pyramids. Most of them are step pyramids. Unlike Egyptian pyramids, which were used as tombs for rulers and wealthy people, Aztec and Mayan pyramids are believed to have been used for public displays of human sacrifice.

"Jerusalem (in Hebrew: ירושלים) is a city in the Middle East. It is about 4,800 years old. Jerusalem is claimed by two countries as their capital: the State of Israel and the State of Palestine. It is a holy city for the Jewish religion from biblical times and the location of the Temple, and consequently important to the later religions of Christianity and Islam. The city of Jerusalem was founded most likely by the Canaanites, who lost it to the Jews in their conquest of Canaan. It became the capital of the nation of Judah, and continued to be the capital after Judah broke into Judah and Israel. Much of the city had been improved by King Solomon, who constructed a large temple considered by some to be the most important temple of the Jewish religion and the world. Jerusalem was sacked by the Babylonians in their conquest of Judah, and much of it was destroyed. It was returned to the Jews by the Persians, and later made a part of Alexander the Great's empire, and even later part of the Roman Empire. During the Roman Empire, it was an important city for the Jews, and Jesus conducted many ministries there. After the end of World War I, the League of Nations mandates France and Great Britain to administer the Arabic regions of the defeated Ottoman Empire: Syria and Lebanon are then under French mandate; Palestine, Transjordan and Iraq are under British mandate. Jerusalem was then the capital of the British Mandate of Palestine, from its establishment in 1920 until its end in 1948. When preparing the expiry of the British Mandate of Palestine, the United Nations voted the so-called Partition Plan for Palestine in 1947 recommending the creation of two independent states, a Jewish one and an Arab one. A small territory including Jerusalem and Bethlehem would bear special international status for another 10 years before its population would decide on its destiny. Shortly after this decision, civil war broke out in Palestine and the UN plan was never implemented. When the British mandate actually expired mid May 1948, the Jewish State of Israel was immediately created and started conquer territory. An Arab state wasn't created; neighbouring countries opposed Israeli in what's called the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Within about ten months, Israel conquered a big part of the country, including part of Jerusalem (which would then be known as West Jerusalem). Jordan took control on the Eastern part of the country and the remaining part of Jerusalem (becoming known as East Jerusalem), including the old walled city. During the Six-Days War in 1967, Israel conquered East Jerusalem. Today, Israel considers Jerusalem as its capital but the international community doesn't recognize this status as legitimate because the Eastern part of the city was annexed illegally: it considers the status of Jerusalem to be agreed between parties as part of the resolution of the whole Israel-Palestine conflict. Indeed, Palestinians also consider Jerusalem as the capital of their State, although they say they would be open to a solution where Jerusalem would have a special status.",Easy
"Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) is the paramilitary force responsible for safeguarding the borders of Bangladesh. Established on June 27, 1795, as the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR), it underwent a name change in 2010 to emphasize its primary role in border security. The force plays a crucial role in maintaining national security, preventing illegal activities, and ensuring the integrity of Bangladesh's borders. The roots of BGB can be traced back to the British East India Company's efforts to protect the eastern frontiers of Bengal. Over the years, the force evolved and saw various transformations before officially becoming the Border Guard Bangladesh. The primary mission of the Border Guard Bangladesh is to secure the nation's borders and prevent unauthorized entry, human trafficking, smuggling, and other illegal activities. BGB also plays a vital role in disaster management, providing assistance during natural calamities and emergencies. BGB operates under the Ministry of Home Affairs of Bangladesh and is headed by a Director-General. The force is organized into various sectors, regions, and battalions, each responsible for specific border areas. BGB personnel undergo rigorous training to equip them with the skills necessary for border security and law enforcement. Border Guard Bangladesh collaborates with neighboring countries and international organizations to enhance regional security. Coordination with the Border Security Force (BSF) of India is particularly significant, as both forces work closely to address common border challenges and maintain good diplomatic relations. BGB faces challenges such as cross-border crimes, smuggling, and illegal migration. The force has, however, achieved notable success in curbing these activities and maintaining the territorial integrity of Bangladesh. BGB personnel are recognized for their commitment to duty and their contribution to national security. Like many border security forces worldwide, BGB has faced criticism and controversies, including allegations of human rights abuses and extrajudicial activities. Such issues highlight the delicate balance between maintaining border security and respecting individual rights.

"""The Fall of the House of Usher"" is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe. It was first published in 1839. A movie based on the story was released in 1960. Roderick and Madeline Usher are brother and sister, and the last of an evil family. They live in a crumbling mansion surrounded by a swamp. Roderick is a nervous hypochondriac. Roderick is visited by an old friend. He tells this friend that Madeline has recently died and is lying in the family vault beneath the house before permanent burial. On a stormy night, Roderick and his friend hear Madeline rising from the vault. Roderick tells his friend that Madeline had deathlike spells and that he entombed her alive when she fell into one of these spells. He wants to end the evil of the Usher line. The door opens. Madeline falls upon her brother. The two die, and the house falls in ruins as the friend escapes. The story was first published in the September 1839 issue of Burton's Gentleman's Magazine. It was slightly revised in 1840 for Poe's Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque. ""The Haunted Palace"" is a poem within the story. This poem had been published separately in the April 1839 issue of the Baltimore Museum magazine. The story has been adapted to the movies and to operas.

"The Bir Tawil refers to a portion of land in between Sudan and Egypt. It is best known as one of the last pieces of land on Earth that does not belong to any country that is also not claimed by any recognized country, also known as ""terra nullius"". In 1899, Sudan was controlled by both Egypt and The United Kingdom, and a border needed to be created. So, the border between Egypt and Sudan was set at the 22nd parallel north of latitude. However, the border was later redrawn due to tribal usage of the land, with a large portion of land north of the 22nd parallel being given to Sudan (the Hala'ib triangle), and a small portion south (the Bir Tawil) was given to Egypt. The Hala'ib triangle is much more important to control than the Bir Tawil, as Hala'ib is inhabited and far larger with access to the ocean, while Bir Tawil has no access to the ocean and is completely uninhabited. Oil reserves were also found close to the Hala'ib Triangle. Both Egypt and Sudan today claim the Hala'ib triangle, with Egypt justifying their claim with the original 1899 border decision, and Sudan justifying their claim with the 1902 change, and so, if either country tried to claim Bir Tawil, they would have to give up the Hala'ib triangle. In 2014, a man from Virginia named Jeremiah Heaton travelled to Bir Tawil, and claimed it as the ""Kingdom of North Sudan"". He did this because his then 7-year old daughter dreamed of becoming a real princess, and he promised her that she would be. However, no government recognizes this claim. Shortly after, two Russian men travelled to Bir Tawil and claimed it as the ""Kingdom of Middle Earth"".

Someone with dementia is called a demented person and having dementia is called dementia. There are a total of 50 types of dementia. These include Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia and Korsakov's syndrome. While people with dementia can be forgetful, forgetfulness is different from dementia In dementia, the nerve cells break down. Sometimes the nerve cells themselves do not break down, but the connections between them no longer work properly. This decrease causes the brain to work less well. In some patients, the decline is much faster than in others. As a result, one person can live independently for a long time and the other cannot. Eventually, the patient becomes so weakened by the dementia that it dies from the disease. An infection can also arise from pneumonia, because the patient can no longer swallow.",Easy

"The violin is a string instrument that is played with a bow. The violin has four strings, which are tuned to the notes, G, D, A, and E. The violin is held between the left collar bone (near the shoulder) and the chin. Different notes are made by fingering, with the left hand while bowing with the right. It has no frets or other markers, so players have to learn the exact place to put the fingers of the left hand by memory alone. The violin is the smallest and highest pitched instrument in the string family. The other instruments in the family are: viola, cello and double bass. A person who plays the violin is called a violinist. A person who makes or repairs a violin is called a luthier. The violin is about 400 years old. By the time the modern orchestra started in the 17th century the violin was fully developed and it became the most important orchestral instrument. It is used as a solo instrument, in chamber music, in orchestral music and in jazz as well as in folk music. The violin was more like the medieval rebec which was an instrument held under the chin and bowed. In the 16th century there was an instrument called the lira da braccio, which was an early form of the violin. In the 17th century there were several families of luthiers who were extremely good at making instruments. The most famous violin makers were Stradivarius, Amati and Guarneri. Some of the instruments that these luthiers made are still in existence today. They are some of the best instruments in existence, and can fetch prices of several million dollars. The biggest part of the violin is the wooden body. It is made of spruce. Many violins also have a chinrest. This helps to hold the violin against the player's shoulder. A shoulder rest is also used. These are now made of foam, with special legs to hold them on to the violin. As these are not particularly cheap, many beginners instead use a sponge and an elastic band. To make it easier to tune the violin, many people find it helpful to have “adjusters” for “fine tuning” when the string is only slightly out of tune. These adjusters go through holes in the tailpiece. Strings used to be made of gut, but now they are mostly made of steel or nylon. Adjusters can only be used with steel strings. The bow can be made of several kinds of wood, for example pernambuco. Some players today use bows made of carbon fibre. The bow is strung with horsehair. As with most instruments, it takes years of practice to become a really good violinist. Beginners start by practicing on the “open strings” (without using the left-hand fingers). At first the beginner can pluck the strings, then he or she can learn how to use the bow. Gradually the player can learn how to stop the strings with the fingers to get all the different notes. At first the learner will play in “first position”. This means that finger 1 (the fingers are numbered from 1 to 4, the thumb being behind the neck of the instrument) is playing a note which is a whole tone above the open string, e.g. on the D string it is playing a stopped E. When he or she is more advanced they will play in other positions by moving the left hand up the fingerboard nearer to the bridge. There is also a half position in which the first finger is stretched back. The violinist has to learn to put the fingers in exactly the right place so that the music is “in tune” (this is called intonation). He will also learn vibrato. Besides plucking (pizzicato) there are many special effects such as glissando, portamento and harmonics as well as double stopping, chords or using scordatura tuning. The violin can be played either standing or sitting down. When playing solo music the violinist normally stands, but when playing in chamber music or in orchestras he sits (although this was not always the case). When sitting he may have to turn his right leg in so that it does not get in the way of the bow. In the 17th and 18th centuries composers wrote a lot of music for solo violin. Many of these composers were from Italy and were themselves violinists: Corelli, Vitali, Vivaldi, Veracini, Geminiani, Locatelli and Tartini. In Germany, Schmelzer and Biber wrote some very virtuoso violin music. Later, in the early 18th century, Bach and Handel wrote many masterpieces for the violin. In the Classical music period the great composers Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all wrote solo works for the violin as well as a vast amount of chamber music, especially string quartets. In the Romantic period many virtuoso violin works were written. These include concertos by Mendelssohn, Saint-Saëns, Brahms, Bruch, Wieniawski, Tchaikovsky, Dvořák. In the 19th century Niccolò Paganini was undoubtedly the most famous violinist. He composed and played violin music that was harder than anyone had played before. People compared him to the devil because he could play so brilliantly (and because of his looks). In the 20th century Elgar, Sibelius, Szymanowski, Bartók, Stravinsky, Berg, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Hindemith and Penderecki. In recent years the violin has also been used in jazz playing. Stephane Grappelli was especially famous for this. Some of the most famous violinists of the last century are Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz, David Oistrakh, Yehudi Menuhin, Ida Haendel and Isaac Stern. Today some of the greatest players include Itzhak Perlman, Maxim Vengerov, Vadim Repin, Nigel Kennedy, Hilary Hahn, Joshua Bell, and the fiddler Sara Watkins.",Easy

"Sierra Leone, officially the Republic of Sierra Leone, is a country on the southwest coast of West Africa. It shares its southeastern border with Liberia, and the northern half of the nation is surrounded by Guinea. Covering a total area of 71,740 km2 Sierra Leone has a tropical climate, with diverse environments ranging from savanna to rainforests. The country has a population of 7,092,113 as of the 2015 census. Freetown is the capital and largest city. Sierra Leone is a constitutional republic. The current president is Julius Maada Bio. Sierra Leone is a secular nation with the constitution providing for the separation of state and religion and freedom of conscience (which includes freedom of thoughts and religion). Muslims make up about three-quarters of the population, though with an influential Christian minority. The geographic area has been inhabited for millennia, but Sierra Leone, as the country and its borders are known today, was founded by the British Crown. Sierra Leone gained independence from the United Kingdom on 27 April 1961, and became a Commonwealth realm on the same day; the country's name changed to the Dominion of Sierra Leone. About 18 ethnic groups inhabit Sierra Leone; the two largest and most influential ones are the Temne and Mende peoples. About 2% of the country's population are Creole people, descendants of freed African-American and Afro-Caribbeanslaves. English is the official language used in schools and government administration. Krio is the most widely spoken language across Sierra Leone, spoken by 97% of the country's population. Sierra Leone is rich in natural resources, especially diamond, gold, bauxite and aluminium. The country is a member of the United Nations, African Union, Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Mano River Union, Commonwealth of Nations, IMF, World Bank, WTO, African Development Bank, and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Education in Sierra Leone is legally required for all children for six years at primary level and three years in junior secondary education, but a shortage of schools and teachers has made implementation impossible. Two thirds of the adult population of the country are illiterate. The Sierra Leone Civil War resulted in the destruction of 1,270 primary schools, and in 2001, 67% of all school-age children were out of school. The situation has improved considerably since then with primary school enrolment doubling between 2001 and 2005 and the reconstruction of many schools since the end of the war. Students at primary schools are usually 6 to 12 years old, and in secondary schools 13 to 18. Primary education is free and compulsory in government-sponsored public schools. The country has three universities: Fourah Bay College, founded in 1827 (the oldest university in West Africa), University of Makeni (established initially in September 2005 as The Fatima Institute, the college was granted university status in August 2009, and assumed the name University of Makeni, or UNIMAK), and Njala University, primarily located in Bo District.

"The Suez Canal (Arabic: قناة السويس, Qanā al-Suways, French: Le Canal de Suez) is a canal in Egypt. It lies west of the Sinai Peninsula. It is 190 kilometers long, 350 meters wide and 22,5 meters deep. It links the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. It runs between Port Said (Būr Sa'īd) on the Mediterranean Sea, and Suez (al-Suways) on the Red Sea. The canal was started in 1859 and finished in 1869. Thanks to the Suez Canal, ships can travel from Europe to Asia without going around Africa. It was built by a French company and especially the French engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps. The building of the canal didn't please everyone especially not the English. The canal allows boatsships to travel from Europe to Asia without having to go the way around Africa. It was built to go from Egypt to the Indian Ocean. In 1859, the Suez Canal was built by the Universal Suez Ship Canal Company, and took 10 years to build. The first ship to pass through the canal did so on 17 February 1867; Giuseppe Verdi wrote the famous opera Aida for this ceremony. The canal made it possible to easily transport goods across the world. The canal also allowed Europeans to travel to East Africa, and this area was soon controlled by European powers. The success of the Suez Canal encouraged the French to try to build the Panama Canal. But they did not finish it. The Panama Canal was finished later. Long after its building, the French, the English, and the Egyptians still didn't agree on who the canal belonged to. Finally in 1956 Nasser, then Egypt's president, nationalised the canal. After the Six Day War in 1967, the canal remained closed until June 5, 1975. A UN peacekeeping force has been stationed in the Sinai Peninsula since 1974, to avoid more wars. About 15,000 ships pass through the canal each year, which is about 14% of world shipping. Each ship takes up to 16 hours to cross the canal. en:Suez Canal",Easy
"Iraq is a country in southwestern Asia. Iraq borders with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to the south, Turkey to the north, Syria to the north-west, Jordan to the west, and Iran to the east. The capital of Iraq is Baghdad. Iraq has been known by the Greek name Mesopotamia which means (Land between the rivers) and has been home to continuous successive civilizations since the 6th millennium BC. The region between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers is often referred to as the cradle of civilization and the birthplace of writing. Iraq was part of several empires, some were Safavid, and Afsharid. Most Iraqis are Shia Muslims. From 1968 to 2003, Iraq was run by the Ba'ath Party. Saddam Hussein was the President from 1979 until the disbandment of the Ba'ath Party. In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. Many countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, France, Italy, Pakistan, and others fought to free Kuwait. Later, some agents believed to be sent by Saddam Hussein tried to kill former President George H. W. Bush with a truck bomb in Kuwait. In March 2003, an invasion led by American, British, Australian, Danish and Polish forces forced the Ba'ath Party to surrender. The publicly stated reason for the invasion was that Saddam Hussein refused to let United Nations inspectors look for suspected nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. In the past, Iraq used chemical weapons to kill people. Iraq used chemical gas on some Kurdish villages such as ""Halabja"" and killed five thousand Kurds in the north of Iraq. Iraq had done research in making biological and nuclear weapons. The country was initially split into 3 zones, the American zone, the British zone, and the Polish zone similar to the way Germany was divided in 1945. Forces from Denmark controlled areas in the British zone. A new temporary government was formed on June 28, 2004. The coalition forces were in the country. There were many U.S., British and multi-national troops in the country until December 15, 2011 when the Iraq War had ended. Tensions between religious groups (Shia and Sunni Muslims, as well as Christians) lead to a great deal of instability in the country. The country area lies between two rivers; for this reason the area was called Mesopotamia in ancient ages. The rivers Euphrates and Tigris bound what is called the Fertile Crescent. Iraq also has a small coastline along the Persian Gulf, and this coastline was considered the heart of the petroleum trade in Iraq before the First Gulf War. The weather is extremely hot and dry because Iraq is far from seas and oceans and even the close ones are blocked by mountains so that the rainy wind can not reach the inlands. This region has fertile land because of the two rivers. Iraq is divided into 18 provinces (muhafazah). Iraq has a large amount of oil. Iraq is the world's number four in petroleum production and the world's number two in petroleum reserves. In the past, Iraq sold much of this oil to other countries. After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, the United Nations stopped Iraq from selling the oil. The United Nations later allowed Iraq to sell some oil to buy food, clothes, and medicine so the people would not suffer as much. This was called the ""Oil-for-Food"" program.",Easy

"The Hague (Dutch: Den Haag or s-Gravenhage) is the Netherlands' third largest city, after Amsterdam and Rotterdam. While Amsterdam is the nation's capital, The Hague is the seat of government and the king. It's also the capital of the South Holland province. The City itself has 500,000 inhabitants, the agglomeration has more than 1 million. L'Aia (Italian Name) - The Hague (English name) - La Haye (French) The Hague's history began around 1230, when count Floris IV of Holland (Holland is a Dutch region, so not the whole country) decided to build a hunting residence along a pond, nowadays called the Hofvijver. His son, Willem II, expanded the residence and it became a palace, nowadays called the Binnenhof. Willem died before the palace was completed, so it was finished by his son Floris V. Since then, the counts of Holland used The Hague as their residence and administrative center when in Holland. Around the Binnenhof and the Hofvijver grew a village, called Haga. From the 17th century on, the name 's-Gravenhage was used (Old Dutch, the count's wood). When the Eighty Years' War, the Dutch independence war against the Spanish, started, the Spanish troops easily conquered the town, due to the absence of city walls. The government of Holland even wanted to demolish the city, but this was prevented by William of Orange, the leader of the Dutch revolt. After the Netherlands declared their independence, The Hague became the seat of government of the Dutch Republic. It never got city rights, but did have the benefits that came with it. In 1806, The Hague was granted city rights by Louis Bonaparte. After the Napoleonic Wars, modern-day Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands became one country, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, with Williams of Orange's descendants as kings and queens. Every two years, the capital switched from Amsterdam to Brussels, but The Hague remained the seat of government. After the Belgian revolt and separation in 1830, Amsterdam became the only capital, while The Hague stayed the seat of government. The Hague quickly grew, resulting in annexing (taking over) nearby municipalities, like the rural village Loosduinen. Many new neighborhoods where built. Most of them for Dutchmen who retired after they came back from the Dutch colony Dutch East Indies, modern-day Indonesia. In World War II The Hague was conquered by the Germans after the world's first paratroop assault. They built he Atlantic Wall straight trough the city, causing a large quarter to be demolished by the Nazi's and the evacuation of the people of neighboring fishing village Scheveningen. In March 1945 the British mistakenly bombed the historic and heavily populated Bezuidenhout quarter, causing 551 deaths. The Hague is divided into 8 boroughs (Dutch: stadsdelen): The Hague houses many major international and European organisations. Most of them have something to do with justice. Together with New York City, Geneva an Vienna it's one of the major United Nations cities. Because of all these organizations The Hague's motto is Vrede en Recht (Peace and Justice). The Hague's public transport is operated by HTM. The city has 11 tram lines, 3 light rail lines (which connect the city to its suburbs, like Zoetermeer) and 8 bus lines. The Hague has two major train stations: Den Haag Centraal (The Hague Central) and Den Haag Hollands Spoor. Southbound and northbound trains stop at Hollands Spoor, eastbound and westbound trains begin or terminate at Centraal. Centraal is also the terminal station for Line E of the Rotterdam subway.

"The Hague (Dutch: Den Haag or s-Gravenhage) is the Netherlands' third largest city, after Amsterdam and Rotterdam. While Amsterdam is the nation's capital, The Hague is the seat of government and the king. It's also the capital of the South Holland province. The City itself has 500,000 inhabitants, the agglomeration has more than 1 million. L'Aia (Italian Name) - The Hague (English name) - La Haye (French) The Hague's history began around 1230, when count Floris IV of Holland (Holland is a Dutch region, so not the whole country) decided to build a hunting residence along a pond, nowadays called the Hofvijver. His son, Willem II, expanded the residence and it became a palace, nowadays called the Binnenhof. Willem died before the palace was completed, so it was finished by his son Floris V. Since then, the counts of Holland used The Hague as their residence and administrative center when in Holland. Around the Binnenhof and the Hofvijver grew a village, called Haga. From the 17th century on, the name 's-Gravenhage was used (Old Dutch, the count's wood). When the Eighty Years' War, the Dutch independence war against the Spanish, started, the Spanish troops easily conquered the town, due to the absence of city walls. The government of Holland even wanted to demolish the city, but this was prevented by William of Orange, the leader of the Dutch revolt. After the Netherlands declared their independence, The Hague became the seat of government of the Dutch Republic. It never got city rights, but did have the benefits that came with it. In 1806, The Hague was granted city rights by Louis Bonaparte. After the Napoleonic Wars, modern-day Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands became one country, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, with Williams of Orange's descendants as kings and queens. Every two years, the capital switched from Amsterdam to Brussels, but The Hague remained the seat of government. After the Belgian revolt and separation in 1830, Amsterdam became the only capital, while The Hague stayed the seat of government. The Hague quickly grew, resulting in annexing (taking over) nearby municipalities, like the rural village Loosduinen. Many new neighborhoods where built. Most of them for Dutchmen who retired after they came back from the Dutch colony Dutch East Indies, modern-day Indonesia. In World War II The Hague was conquered by the Germans after the world's first paratroop assault. They built he Atlantic Wall straight trough the city, causing a large quarter to be demolished by the Nazi's and the evacuation of the people of neighboring fishing village Scheveningen. In March 1945 the British mistakenly bombed the historic and heavily populated Bezuidenhout quarter, causing 551 deaths. The Hague is divided into 8 boroughs (Dutch: stadsdelen): The Hague houses many major international and European organisations. Most of them have something to do with justice. Together with New York City, Geneva an Vienna it's one of the major United Nations cities. Because of all these organizations The Hague's motto is Vrede en Recht (Peace and Justice). The Hague's public transport is operated by HTM. The city has 11 tram lines, 3 light rail lines (which connect the city to its suburbs, like Zoetermeer) and 8 bus lines. The Hague has two major train stations: Den Haag Centraal (The Hague Central) and Den Haag Hollands Spoor. Southbound and northbound trains stop at Hollands Spoor, eastbound and westbound trains begin or terminate at Centraal. Centraal is also the terminal station for Line E of the Rotterdam subway. The Hague shares an airport with neighboring Rotterdam: Rotterdam The Hague Airport. It's also served by Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.",Easy

"Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game originally created by Markus Persson (often called Notch). It is currently developed by Mojang, with Jens Bergensten as the lead programmer. The game is currently available for computers (Windows, OS X, and Linux), video game consoles (Xbox 360 and Xbox One; PlayStation 3, 4, and Vita; and Wii U), and mobile devices (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Amazon Fire OS, and Windows 10). On September 15, 2014, Microsoft announced that it was going to buy Mojang (and, therefore, Minecraft) for $2.5 billion (USD). Today, Minecraft is the 1st most sold video game of the world. Minecraft is a sandbox game (the player has the liberty to do what he wants, and there are no particular rules to follow). The player appears in a three-dimensional world composed of blocks. He must survive, build, create and live in the world. There are four gamemodes in minecraft: survival, creative, hardcore and adventure. In the survival mode, the player has to obtain what he needs (limited resources), survive. His life is represented by 10 red hearts which he loses when getting damage and can slowly regain. His hunger is represented by 10 shanks. Creative mode is made to create freely: the player has unlimited resources, can fly and does not die. Hardcore mode is a harder version of survival, where the player is on hard, cannot cheat and cannot respawn after he or she died. When the player dies, the world is deleted. In 1.8, you can now see your world in spectator mode, but you can't change anything. The player is about 1.8 blocks tall. There are 2 main skins of the player: Steve (a man with brown hair, light brown skin, blue eyes, a light blue T-shirt, dark blue trousers and grey shoes) and Alex (a woman with long orange hair, a light green T-shirt, a dark green belt, brown trousers and black boots). The skin can then be changed in the options, and you can download skins from the internet or create them. A mob (abbreviation for mobile) is a living, moving entity which can live, die, and have effects. There are different types of mobs: passive mobs (do not attack), neutral mobs (do not attack until provoked) and hostile mobs (always attack) Piglins are a new mob added in the 1.16 update for both the mobile and computer editions of Minecraft. You can trade gold ingots with them for gold ingots. They only attack you if you attack them first, you aren't wearing gold armor, or if you open a container (chest, barrel, etc) near them. The blaze is a mob from the nether. He has a yellow head with yellow rods turning around him, and emits smoke. When he sees the player, he shoots fireballs which burn the player for a few seconds, and can also deals contact damage. It drops blaze rods. The creeper is one of the most frequent hostile mobs. He is a green mob that is about 1.7 blocks tall with 4 legs. Creepers go next to the player and then explode. If killed by a player or a tamed dog, they drop gunpowder. They also give music discs if killed by a skeleton. If creepers are struck by lightning, they will become a charged creeper which will have a larger blast radius, and all zombies, skeletons, wither skeletons or creepers in the radius will drop their heads. They were invented by a bug which made the pig have a vertical body. When the player uses an ender pearl, there is a chance that an endermite will appear. An endermite is a small dark purple mob who attacks the player like a silverfish. When an enderman sees an endermite, he will try to kill him. Ghasts are hostile mobs from the nether. When they see the player, they will open their mouth and shoot a fireball. The fireball can be pushed back by your hand or an arrow, and if touched by their own fireball, ghasts will immediately die. They drop ghast tears. Guardians and elder guardians are hostile mobs that spawn in ocean monuments. Skeletons are mobs that shoot arrows to attack the player. They drop bones when killed. Slimes are hostile mobs that split up after being killed. Small slimes will only push the player. Small slimes drop slimeballs after being killed. Other slimes don’t drop anything. Magma cubes are the variant of slimes that spawn in the nether. They drop magma cream. Witches are hostile mobs that use potions both to heal up and to attack the player. They may drop the potion they are drinking upon death. They might also drop brewing ingredients and sticks. Wither skeletons are nether mobs that, unlike normal skeletons, use a melee attack. The zombie is one of the most frequent mobs. He looks like a green Steve with his hands in front of him. Like skeletons, zombies can spawn with armor or a sword (which can be enchanted) or take a dropped armor or sword (which can also be enchanted). Upon death, zombies will drop rotten flesh, which can be eaten but gives you food poisoning. It can also be used to feed dogs. Zombies can spawn as zombie villagers. Zombie villagers look like green villagers with torn clothes. When zombies kill villagers, the villagers have a chance to become zombie villagers (0% on easy, 50% on normal and 100% on hard). In early 2009, Minecraft was being privately developed by Notch, aka Markus Persson. It was released just 6 days later, in the first phase. Players were only limited to a few blocks and creative mode. Added features in this phase were more about testing. This game was originally called Cave Game. This game was different than other online games where you create things because instead of simply creating structures, you also have to gather resources to build those structures.This mix was unusual because most games at the time usually only had the player gather resources and not build or to build but not have to gather resources. On top of that, Minecraft was also a survival game. You have to survive hostile mobs and can explore the vast world. You can also use your resources to craft new materials that you can use to create structures, survive longer, and craft more materials.Updates that occurred after the release was 1.0.0. It was the explorer update that added all the features in the base game, like health and other base features.",Easy

"Claudius (Latin: Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus; 1 August 10 BC – 13 October 54 AD) was the fourth Roman emperor. He reigned from 41 to 54. He was born at Lugdunum in Gaul, the first Roman Emperor to be born outside Italy. Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, his family did not want him. He was excluded from public office until his consulship, shared with his nephew Caligula in 37. Claudius' infirmity probably saved him from the fate of many other nobles during the purges of Tiberius and Caligula's reigns. Potential enemies did not see him as a serious threat. He was declared Emperor by the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's assassination. He was then the last man of his family. Despite his lack of experience, Claudius was an able and efficient administrator. He was also an ambitious builder, constructing many new roads, aqueducts, and canals across the Roman Empire. During his reign the Empire began the conquest of Britain (if the earlier invasions of Britain by Caesar are not counted). Having an interest in law, he presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day. He was seen as vulnerable throughout his reign, especially by men of the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to maintain his position. This resulted in the deaths of many senators. Many writers say that he was murdered by his own wife. After his death in 54 (at age of 63), his grand-nephew and adopted son Nero followed him as Emperor.",Easy
"Pompeii was a city in Ancient Rome, near modern Naples in southern Italy . The city had been built in the shadow of Vesuvius, an active volcano. On 24 August, 79 AD, Vesuvius erupted. Pompeii, the city of Herculaneum, and several villas in the surrounding countryside were buried (and preserved) beneath 4 to 6 m (13 to 20 ft) of ash and pumice. Pompeii was rediscovered in 1599.

Villas, public buildings, streets, works of art, and everyday objects like jugs of wine had been preserved deep beneath the surface in an airless and moistureless environment. The dead were also preserved in their last moments. The city was well better conserved be pause of the eruption, the only positive reason . Although many people fled to the sea during the disaster, many remained behind in their homes. One of the dead was Pliny the Elder, a Roman admiral who tried his best to save many citizens.

"South Asia refers to the Indian subcontinent and its adjoining areas to the south of the Asian continent. It is bounded on the west by West Asia or the Middle East, on the north by Central Asia, and on the east by East Asia and Southeast Asia. South Asia consists of the following states (alphabetically): In addition to the above countries, Afghanistan has been included in the UN-declared sub region of South Asia. The name is often used to refer to the whole of Asia, south of the former Soviet Union. The Indian subcontinent refers to the countries that are geographically located on the Indian plate and south of the Eurasian plate. Geopolitically, the Indian subcontinent includes parts of South Asia or South Asia, i.e. countries outside and close to the Indian plate. For example: Afghanistan is sometimes considered part of the region because of its existing political and social ties with Pakistan and as part of the ancient Maurya and Mughal empires. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC for short) is a government agency in South Asia. Its member countries are Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Maldives, Nepal, Bhutan and Afghanistan. People's Republic of China and Japan have been selected as SAARC observers. SAARC was established on December 6, 1975. The leaders of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka signed a royal charter to promote regional relations, economic, social and cultural development in South Asia and friendly relations and cooperation with other developing countries. South Asia has a population of about 1.749 billion, making it the most populous region in the world. It is socially very mixed, consisting of many language divisions and religions, and the social practices of one region which are of a completely different nature from another region. South Asia is home to some of the world's most populous super-metropolises. Dhaka, Delhi, Mumbai and Karachi are the four most populous metropolises in the world. There are many languages ​​in South Asia. The spoken languages ​​of this region are mainly divided on the basis of geography and across religious boundaries but the written scripts are vastly divided by religious boundaries. In particular, Muslims in South Asia, such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, use the Arabic alphabet and Persian Nastaliq. Until 1971, Muslim-dominated Bangladesh (then known as East Pakistan) made only the Nastaliq script compulsory, but has since adopted the regional script and especially the Bengali language. Non-Muslims in South Asia and some Muslims in India, on the other hand, use their traditional ancient scripts, such as the Brahmi script for Indo-European languages ​​and the Brahmi script for Dravidian and other languages. In 2010, Hindus, Jains and Sikhs had the largest population in the world in South Asia, with about 510 million Muslims, as well as 25 million Buddhists and 35 million Christians.

"Dhaka is the capital and most populous city of Bangladesh in southern Asia. The urban area had 15.391 million people as of 2011. Set beside the Buriganga River, it’s at the center of national government, trade and culture. The 17th-century old city was the Mughal capital of Bengal, and many palaces and mosques remain. American architect Louis Khan’s National Parliament House complex typifies the huge, fast-growing modern metropolis. Dhaka is the financial, commercial and the entertainment capital of Bangladesh, and accounts for up to 35% of Bangladesh's economy. Since its establishment as a modern capital city the population, area, social and economic diversity of Dhaka have grown tremendously, the city is now one of the most densely industrialized regions in Bangladesh. Dhaka is a major beta-global city, as it hosts the headquarters of several international corporations. By the 21st century, it emerged as a megacity. The Dhaka Stock Exchange has over 750 listed companies. The city hosts over 50 diplomatic missions and the headquarters of BIMSTEC. The city's culture is known for its cycle-rickshaws, cuisine, art festivals and religious diversity. The old city is home to around 2 000 buildings from the Mughal and British periods, including notable structures such as the Bara Katra and Choto Katra caravansaries. The origins of the name for Dhaka are uncertain. Once dhak trees were very common in the area and the name may have originated from it. Alternatively, this name may refer to the hidden Hindu goddess Dhakeshwari, whose temple is located in the south-western part of the city. Another popular theory states that Dhaka refers to a membranophone instrument, dhak which was played by order of Subahdar Islam Khan I during the inaugurating of the Bengal capital in 1610. Some references also say it was derived from a Prakrit dialect called Dhaka Bhasa; or Dhakka, used in the Rajtarangini for a watch-station; or it is the same as Davaka, mentioned in the Allahabad pillar inscription of Samudragupta as an eastern frontier kingdom. According to Rajatarangini written by a Kashmiri Brahman, Kalhana, the region was originally known as Dhakka. The word Dhakka means watchtower. Bikrampur and Sonargaon—the earlier strongholds of Bengal rulers were situated nearby. So Dhaka was most likely used as the watchtower for the fortification purpose. Dhaka, Bangladesh's vibrant capital city, has a rich and varied history spanning millennia. Dhaka's history is a fascinating journey through the ebb and flow of cultures, religions, and civilizations. This article delves into Dhaka's historical tapestry, unravelling the layers that have shaped this city into the dynamic cultural and economic center that it is today. The history of Dhaka can be traced back to the ancient period when it was known as Dhaka-kola. The region served as an important center for trade and commerce, connecting the hinterlands with the Silk Road. Over the centuries, various empires, including the Mauryas, Guptas, and Pala dynasties, exerted their influence on the area, contributing to its cultural and architectural evolution. Dhaka rose to prominence during the medieval period under the Delhi Sultanate and later the Bengal Sultanate. It became a strategic administrative and commercial center, attracting merchants and artisans from across the Indian subcontinent and beyond. The city's growth was accelerated during the Mughal era when it became a provincial capital under the rule of Emperor Akbar. The Lalbagh Fort, an iconic Mughal structure, stands as a testament to this period, though it was left incomplete due to historical circumstances. The arrival of European colonizers in the 17th century marked a new chapter in Dhaka's history. The city passed through Portuguese, Dutch, and finally British hands. Under British rule, Dhaka evolved into a significant center for trade and administration. The British legacy is evident in the architectural marvels scattered across the city, including the Ahsan Manzil and the Dhaka University campus. Dhaka played a pivotal role in the struggle for independence, culminating in the birth of Bangladesh in 1971. The Jatiyo Sangsad Bhaban, designed by renowned architect Louis Kahn, witnessed the proclamation of independence. The Liberation War Museum stands as a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made during this tumultuous period. In the post-independence era, Dhaka has undergone rapid urbanization and transformation. The city has emerged as a major economic, political, and cultural hub in South Asia. Its skyline is adorned with modern skyscrapers, and the streets buzz with the energy of a growing population.",Easy

"A keyboard layout is an arrangement of the keys on a keyboard. It enables us to use the keyboard of a typewriter in the past, or on a computer nowadays. These are three examples of the most common keyboard layouts. The QWERTY layout was created in the 1870s. It was created to prevent the type bars to overlap themselves. It is still used today in most English-speaking countries, but also in Spain and Italy. The QWERTZ layout was created for Germany countries (in German, but also in Austria and Switzerland, and most of the countries in Central Europe). One of the difference with the QWERTY keyboard is that the Z and the Q keys are switched (this is because that the Z letter is more used in the German language than in English.).

"Justinian I (born 11 May 483 and died 13 November 565) was a Byzantine emperor who reigned from 527 to 565. He was one of the most important rulers of the late antiquity. He is above all known for originating a group of very important laws, the Code of Justinian, which regulated life in the Byzantine Empire for centuries, and strongly influenced Europe in Medieval times. Justinian also increased the territories of his Empire during his reign, for he tried to reconstruct the Roman Empire as it was in the second century. On the religious front, he has also played a great role, trying to unify the Christian beliefs but also to impose his views on the Pope. Justinian (Flavius Petrus Sabbatius Justinianus in Latin) was born in Illyria on 11 May 483, in the city of Tauresium. He came from a fairly modest family of Roman culture. He was the nephew of a soldier, Justin, who had so much military success that he became an emperor in 518, under the name Justin I. Justin I took Justinian under his wing to involve him in his business. Justinian was then named patrician, and then consul. When his uncle died, in 527, Justinian became Emperor under the name Justinian I. In 523, Justinian married an actress, Theodora, who then became Empress. She had a large amount of influence over him. Justinian has great qualities to be emperor: he has a sense of the state, it is capable of much work and lives fairly simply. He also had much artistic and religious knowledge. Justinian was also able to take men of quality as advisors to, which would allow him to have a very important reign. Justinian died on 15 November 565, after naming his nephew, Justin II, his successor. Justinian's reign marked the transition of the Roman Empire to the Byzantine Empire east of the Mediterranean Sea. Justinian dreamed of recovering the greatness of the Roman Empire, but this had disappeared beginning in 476, in part because of the Germanic invasions. He will therefore, while expanding his empire, focusing on its eastern side, and make it stand on its own. Justinian wanted to recreate the Roman Empire around the Mediterranean Sea. He thus began by making peace with Persia, in 532. This left him free to carry out conquests towards the West. He attacked the Vandal Kingdom, in North Africa, and defeated it in September 533. In liberating the Mediterranean from Vandal ships, this allowed him to conquer Corsica, Sicily, and Sardinia. This conquest was often threatened by other kings, notably the Ostrogothic kings, but Justinian managed to maintain control of Italy throughout his reign. Taking advantage of the quarrels between the Visigoth leaders in Spain, he secured Baetica (modern-day Andalusia). The war had resumed with the Sassanid Persians, but Justinian signed a new peace in 562 allowing him to expand his influence in Armenia and in the Caucasus. Justinian was the last emperor to try to reunite the two parts of the former Roman Empire. But the wars had been very costly. Therefore, his successors, while not giving up the title of Roman Emperor will not seek any more to take military control of the whole Empire, which will gradually lose territories. Progressively, the empire shrunk back down to the Greek world. The Byzantine Empire was already wealthy when Justinian became Emperor. He was thus able to begin reforming the laws. He asked his advisors to bring order to the laws, in particular the edicts that dated from the reigns of Emperors Hadrian and Diocletian. This reorganizations produced a set of laws, at the time called Corpus Juris Civilis (in Latin), which is known today as the Code of Justinian. This code was written in 529. It was written in Latin, the official language of the empire. He also published a modernization of ancient Roman jurisprudence, called the Digest in 533, and a manual for teaching law, called the Institutes (at 533). The new laws that Justinian wanted were written in Greek, and are known as the Novels. They date from after 534. In addition to this reorganization of the laws, Justinian wanted to change and modernize the way the empire functioned. He groups together some provinces, change the ways the Empire function, and often let the provinces be governed by the military to maintain order. His government was very authoritarian. Justinian considered himself to be chosen by God. He wants to rule the Church in exchange for military protection it gives against the heresies. He was a true Christian. For him, Christianity was a state religion, meaning that all of the empire's inhabitants had to be Christian, and that he had the right to decide what was good for the Church. He thus passed regulations on the role of priests and bishops. Justinian tried to fight the pagans. He banned the worship of pagan gods in Anatolia. He also tried to reconcile various Christian groups, who had separated from one another for theological reasons. He fights especially against monophysites Christians. He sometimes had a tendency to oppose popes. Justinian's empire was very wealthy, due to the destruction of the Vandal Kingdom, which decreased piracy in the Mediterranean Sea, and thanks to Justinian's conquests. Byzantine merchants were able to conduct trade throughout the Mediterranean world. There was active trade between Gaul, Italy, the North African coasts, Egypt, and Syria. With the Kingdom of Ethiopia as an intermediary, Byzantium also traded with China via the Silk Road. All of this wealth permitted the development of a significant cultural life. Justinian and his wife Theodora sought to recover the greatness of Ancient Rome. Hymns (a type of religious poem) were composed to glorify the Emperor and Christianity. Artists were invited to enrich and embellish Byzantium and other cities in the Empire. Justinian and Theodora are depicted in their imperial adornments, with great figures from their court, by two famous mosaic panels in the basilica of Ravenna. Justinian is known for having profoundly reorganized the city of Byzantium. Justinian was first great builder. He ordered the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (Byzantium's other name) (dedicated to divine Wisdom, or ""Sophia"" in Greek) with the aid of 2 architects, 100 master builders, and 10,000 workmen. It was built between 532 and 537 by the architects Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus. The first cupola having collapsed in 558, a second was rebuilt in 562. Throughout the empire, Justinian financed the construction of cities, bridges, thermal baths, and roads.",Easy

"The saola or Asian unicorn (scientific name: Pseudoryx nghetinhensis) is a species of antelope native to southeast Asia. It is one of the rarest species on Earth, and one of the most critically endangered animals. It numbers in the tens. A fully-grown saola stands at about 80–90cm at the shoulder. Its body length measures about 150cm with the tail measuring about 25cm. It weighs 90–100kg. Both male and female saola have two sharply-pointed, smooth parallel horns on their heads. These horns can grow to 50cm in length. The name ""saola"" refers to the horns, and means ""spinning wheel supports"". The color of the saola ranges from chestnut brown, to red, to almost black. A dark, narrow stripe runs along the animal's back. The fluffy tail and legs are black. The face has white markings. The saola lives in the moist, evergreen forests of the Annamite mountains along the border of Vietnam and Laos, usually at mid-altitude range (between 400 meters and 1,000 meters above sea level). There is plenty of running water in these mountains. The saolo stay in the highlands during the summer, but descend to the lowlands in winter when their highland water sources run dry. They avoid villages and farmer's fields. The saola is a gentle animal, and will allow humans to pet it. The animal is most active during the day. They stay out of view when predators are roaming in the night. Saola are loners, though they sometimes gather in small herds of two or three animals. The males are probably territorial, but roam further abroad than the females. They mark their territories with a sticky, smelly liquid secreted from their maxillary glands. The males may roam to search for water supplies. It is unknown which animals prey upon the saola, but it is likely tigers and crocodiles do. The greatest threat to the saola is humans. Local people have hunted the animal for its trophy horns. Clearing the land for farms has restricted the animal's range. Saola breed at the start of the rainy season in February and March in Vietnam and April through June in Laos. Females likely give birth to one calf after a seven or eight-month gestation period. Females have four nipples for feeding their young. Saolo are believed to live eight to eleven years. Saola are browsers. Rather than standing in one place to feed, they walk along munching on fig leaves and the leaves of other trees and shrubs. They probably eat fruits, berries, grasses, and other plant matter that grows close to the ground. They stay near a source of running water. The saola is a critically endangered species. Although laws forbid hunting the animal, locals sometimes do hunt the animals for their horns. Saola are also caught in snares and traps set for other animals. When scientists discovered the saola in 1992, it was believed that the species numbered about 250 individuals. That number has dropped sharply since, due to farming and other human developments in the animal's historic lowland range. A small reserve in Vietnam protects the declining population.",Easy

Hitler caused the death of tens of millions of people because he started World War II. He killed himself in 1945. Hitler was born into a family of six in Austria (not Germany, like some people think). Hitler's father later died in 1903, which caused him to fail his High School Exams. He left school in 1905 with no qualifications. Hitler became interested in Antisemitism. This is the false belief that Jews are either evil or otherwise not as good as other people. This caused him to hate Jews for the rest of his life, which eventually brought about the Holocaust. In 1913, Austria wanted all young Austrian men to join the army. Hitler left for Germany because he did not like the Austrian army. Hitler fought at the Battle of Ypres and the Battle of the Somme. He was given the Iron Cross in 1914. After World War I, Hitler went back to Munich. He went to the funeral march of Kurt Eisner. In 1919, Hitler joined the German Workers' Party. Two years later, he became the leader of the party which he later renamed the Nazi party. In 1925, Hitler wrote a book called Mein Kampf (or My Struggle in English) Hitler's actions, teachings, and beliefs that Jewish people were less important than others, lead to the deaths of millions of Jewish people in World War II in concentration camps, while others were attacked and murdered. This was called the Holocaust. After a first victory of the German army (the Wehrmacht), the Allies (United Kingdom, USSR, USA and others) pushed the German forces back from 1943 onwards.

"The Fourth Test of the 1948 Ashes series was one of five Tests in a cricket series between Australia and England. The match was played at Headingley Stadium at Leeds from 22 to 27 July with a rest day on 25 July. Australia won the match by seven wickets to take an unassailable 3–0 series lead. In successfully chasing a target of 404, they set a new world record for the highest victorious runchase in Test history. Needing to win the match to prevent an Australian series victory, England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. England continued to rearrange their team, making three changes in an attempt to find a combination that could challenge Australia, which made two changes forced by injury. Unlike the preceding Tests, England's openers were able to withstand the Australian new ball attack, and the partnership of Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook put on 168 for the opening stand. Washbrook fell for 143 in the last over of the day, but England clearly had the better of the play, ending at 2682 by stumps. Australia's bowlers were heavily criticised for their performance, which was seen as lethargic. The next day, England continued to amass runs, with Australia appearing unthreatening and unable to dislodge Bill Edrich and nightwatchman Alec Bedser, who batted until mid-afternoon. Bedser and Edrich then fell in quick succession for 79 and 111 respectively as England then collapsed and lost 873 to be all out for 496 late in the day. The hosts were heavily criticised for the collapse, which was largely due to unforced errors. Among the Australian bowlers, the wickets were shared. Australia then reached 631 in reply at stumps on day two. Australia were in early trouble on the third morning when English bowler Dick Pollard removed Arthur Morris and captain Donald Bradman in the same over to leave the score at 683. However, Keith Miller (58) and Neil Harvey (112) launched a rapid counter-attack, adding 121 runs in 90 minutes in a display praised for its aesthetic beauty. They were later supported by Sam Loxton (93)—who hit five sixes—and Ray Lindwall (77), who both struck the ball powerfully. Australia ended the day at 4579, having added 394 runs in one day, and 102 runs for the last two wickets to that point. Australia were bowled out for 458 early on the fourth morning after the rest day, and England set about extending their lead, adding 129 for the first wicket, until both openers fell without further addition. In the meantime the workload on the Australian bowlers was heavy as Ernie Toshack had broken down in the first innings and unable to participate further. Edrich and Denis Compton took the score to 2322 until a late collapse saw England reach stumps at 3628. England batted on for two overs on the final day, declaring at 3658. Bill Johnston was the most successful bowler with 495. This left Australia a target of 404 in less than a day, which would require a world record runchase, and allowed Yardley to use the heavy roller to break up the pitch, making batting even harder for the tourists. Most observers predicted an easy England win on a deteriorating surface. Australia started slowly, and Bradman joined Morris at 571 with 347 runs still needed in 257 minutes. They put together a stand of 301 in only 217 minutes, aided by erratic bowling, several missed catches and stumpings to help Australia to a win by seven wickets with 15 minutes remaining. Morris made 182 while Bradman was unbeaten on 173. The England selectors were heavily criticised after the match for failing to include a leg spinner in the team to exploit the favourable conditions. For the third time in a row, the match set a new record for the highest attendance at a Test in England.",Easy

"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Hindi: मोहनदास करमचन्द गांधी, Mohāndās Karamchand Gāndhī; Gujarati: મોહનદાસ કરમચંદ ગાંધી; 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was a leader of nationalism in British-ruled India. He is more commonly called Mahatma Gandhi; mahatma is an honorific meaning ""high-souled"" or ""venerable"" in Sanskrit. He was first called this in 1914 in South Africa. He is also called Bapu in India (Gujarati endearment for ""father"", ""papa""). He was the Martyr of the Nation since 1948. Rabindranath Tagore gave him this name. Gandhi was one of the most important people involved in the movement for the independence of India. He was a non-violent activist, who led the independence movement through a non-violent protest. Mohandas Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, Gujarat, India. Several members of his family worked for the government of the state. When Gandhi was 18 years old, he went to England to study law. After he became a lawyer, he went to the British colony of South Africa where he experienced laws that said people with dark skin had fewer rights than people with light skin. He decided then to become a political activist, so he could help change these unfair laws. He created a powerful, non-violent movement. During Gandhi's life, India was a colony of the United Kingdom, but wanted independence. In 1930, Gandhi led the Salt March. When he returned to India, he helped bring about the country's independence from British rule, inspiring other colonial people to work for their own independence, break up the British Empire, and replace it with the Commonwealth. People of many different religions and ethnic groups lived in British India. Many people thought that the country should break into separate countries so that different groups could have their own countries. In particular, many people thought that Hindus and Muslims should have separate countries. Gandhi was a Hindu, but he liked ideas from many religions including Islam, Judaism and Christianity, and he thought that people of all religions should have the same rights, and could live together peacefully in the same country. In 1938, Gandhi resigned from Congress. He said that he was no longer able to work through Congress to unite the divisions in caste and religion. He also felt that he had little to offer to the political process. In 1947, India became independent from the British Empire and formed two separate countries: India and Pakistan. Gandhi wanted independence, but did not want the split into two different countries. Instead of celebrating on independence day, he was mourning the division of India. Gandhi's principle of satyagraha, often translated as ""way of truth"" or ""pursuit of truth"", has inspired other democratic and anti-racist activists like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Nelson Mandela. Gandhi often said that his values were simple, based upon traditional Hindu beliefs: truth (satya), and non-violence (ahimsa). On January 30, 1948, Gandhi was assassinated by an extremist Hindu activist, Nathuram Godse, who was angry because he felt that Gandhi was too lenient towards Muslims. Godse was hanged as punishment for this.",Easy
"Sleep is important for our body and ""soul"". We do not yet know exactly why we have to sleep. But there is no question that sleeping is useful. Those who cannot sleep at all or who are forcibly prevented from sleeping become ill and can die. During the day, our brain in particular is flooded with lots of different things. Sleep is the time to recharge your batteries, sort everything and store important memories in your mind. Some bodily functions continue to run even while sleeping: breathing, heartbeat, digestion and others. There are two types of sleep that alternate several times during the night: deep sleep and REM sleep. Blood pressure and body temperature drop during deep sleep. Sometimes the muscles move. Then we turn around in our sleep. Our brain is active during REM sleep. The eyes move back and forth quickly. REM is the abbreviation for rapid eye movement. During REM sleep, the body becomes almost stiff. For some people, this doesn't happen, and they can sleepwalk. Our dreams also come in REM sleep. In the dream the brain sorts different images, sounds and feelings. One can see something in a dream without really seeing, hear something without really hearing, or run without really running. Only in this part of sleep do these noticeable and rapid eye movements occur. Children usually sleep longer than adults. A newborn sleeps up to 18 hours a day. Most animals also need to sleep. In some animal species, only one half of the brain sleeps. Only one eye is closed so that the surroundings can still be perceived. Animals such as horses can sleep standing up because their brains do this too, so that if they're scared, they can quickly wake and run away.",Easy

It is made of standing stones in circles. It was built in three main phases, each between about 3100 BC and 1950 BC. The first circle, ~3000 BC, was made of timber. The post holes for the timber have been found. Around 2600 BC, the builders gave up timber in favour of stone. Most of the construction took place between 2640 and 2480 BC. The first stone circle was a set of 'bluestones'. The holes held up to 80 standing stones (shown blue on the plan), only 43 of which can be traced today. The bluestones (made of a rock called dolerite), were thought for much of the 20th century to have been brought from the Preseli Hills, 260 kilometres away in modern-day Pembrokeshire, Wales. Another theory is that they were brought much nearer to the site as glacial erratics by a glacier. Later, ~2400 BC, 30 huge grey sarsen stones were brought to the site. They were erected in a circle 33 metres in diameter, with lintels on top of the standing stones. The remaining blue circles were placed as an inner circle. The site was in use until the Bronze Age. The modern Stonehenge consists entirely of original stones, some of which have been replaced in upright position. There are also several passage tombs and many tumuli nearby. No one knows exactly who built Stonehenge or why they built it. During the summer solstice, the sunrise lines up with some of the stones in a particular way. This suggests that the arrangement of stones may work as a calendar. In Egypt and South America, similar ancient buildings can be found. They also show the time of the solstice. Stonehenge itself is owned by the Crown and managed by English Heritage while the surrounding land is owned by the National Trust. The World Heritage Site includes Avebury and Stonhenge together, though they are quite distinct sites. Stonehenge, however, does have a number of satellite structures which are part of the 'ritual landscape':",Easy

"Volapük is a constructed language that was created between 1879 and 1880, by the German Roman Catholic priest Johann Martin Schleyer. He claims God told him in a dream to create an international language. Volapük's vocabulary is derived mostly from English, with some derived from German and French. Volapük literally means ""World Speech"". Volapük was very popular for around a decade, but it was eventually displaced by Esperanto, as it was considered easier to learn. In 1889, there were around 1 million speakers, but today, an estimated 20-30 people speak Volapuk, and the language is largely kept alive by the internet. The language is often regarded as a historical failure, and has been ridiculed in several languages. For example, volapukaĵo means ""Gibberish"" in Esperanto and volapyk means gibberish in Danish.",Easy

"Limestone is a sedimentary rock, made up mostly of the mineral calcite, a form of calcium carbonate, CaCO3. The calcium carbonate is originally produced by living organisms. Later, some of it goes into solution in sea water. Limestone rocks include mainly organic remains and precipitated carbonate. Limestone makes up about 10% of the total volume of all sedimentary rocks. Limestones are mostly made of calcium carbonate. It is originally made by small photosynthetic protists like certain bacteria, coccolithophores, and algae. Then the carbonate gets used by various animals, like bivalves and the polyps which make coral reefs. They build their shells or framework out of CaCO3 crystals. Carbonates are rocks formed from these sources, plus any CaCO3 which is precipitated out of solution. Some carbonate dissolves in the water. It gets precipitated when the physical condition of the water changes. For example, if the concentration of CaCO3 is high, then a temperature drop, or a pH (acidity) change, can cause precipitation. Florida Bay, the shallow lagoon behind the Florida Keys, is a model for the conditions which produced limestones on the continental shelf. Of course, all the species were somewhat different then but, as an ecosystem, it is similar. In the Florida Bay a type of flowering plant called sea grass is in abundance. Also in abundance is white, milky water full of calcium carbonate. This is mainly formed by Melobesia, a small red alga which lives on the sea grass.p151 Finally, the organisms produce huge amounts of slime, which is a polysaccharide. There is good reason to think the slime is produced by microorganisms to control the way their carbonate skeletons are formed.p139 As a side-effect the slime limits the amount of carbonate which goes into solution.p155 Florida Bay is a flat platform which has laid down a huge amount of carbonate rock. Many limestones contain fossils, and some are made up almost entirely of skeletal material. Chalk is ~99% coccoliths; Solnhofen limestone is famous for its animal fossils; and there are many shelly limestones from different periods. Limestone is not found much before the Cambrian period, because shelled animals had not yet evolved. When limestone is heated to a high temperature, and squeezed at the base of a mountain, it becomes the metamorphic rock marble. Marbles are fairly dense, relatively easy to cut, or be shaped into blocks, and some forms are white in colour. Limestone is hard enough to resist weathering but usually soft enough to be worked (cut and carved) by stonemasons. It is used for building material. Limestone, particularly Portland limestone, became popular in the 19th and 20th centuries for building things such as churches, banks and houses. Limestone is used to make glass and cement. It is also used to make iron in a blast furnace, to remove impurities from the iron ore.",Easy

"The Ebola virus disease is a dangerous virus disease that can kill humans and other primates such as gorillas. The virus is native to Africa. Fruit bats harbor the virus. It is spread to other animals. Humans may eat these animals (or the bats) and this is how they contract the disease. Humans may also contract the disease from contact with an infected human. Signs and symptoms of Ebola usually begin suddenly with a flu-like stage. The victim may be overcome with fatigue, fever, headaches, joint, muscle and abdominal pain. Vomiting, diarrhea and loss of appetite are also common. Less common symptoms include: sore throat, chest pain, hiccups, shortness of breath and trouble swallowing. The average time between contracting the infection and the start of symptoms is 8 to 10 days, but it can vary between 2 and 21 days. The disease progresses to a bleeding stage, both internal and external. Blood may ooze from bodily openings such as the vagina and the nose. The victim bleeds in the gastrointestinal tract.

"The bald eagle (scientific name: Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is a bird of prey native to North America. It is the national bird and the national animal of the United States. The population was once declining in the United States, but the species has recovered and removed from endangered species lists. The adult bird is mainly brown with a white head and tail. The sexes are identical in plumage, but females are about 25 percent larger than males. The beak is large and hooked. The plumage of the young is brown. The call consists of weak staccato, chirping whistles, kleek kik ik ik ik, somewhat similar in cadence to a gull's call. The calls of young birds tend to be more harsh and shrill than those of adults The bald eagle has a body length of 70–102 cm (28–40 in). Typical wingspan is between 1.8 and 2.3 m (5.9 and 7.5 ft). Mass is normally between 3 and 6.3 kg (6.6 and 13.9 lb). Females are about 25% larger than males, averaging 5.6 kg (12 lb), and against the males' average weight of 4.1 kg (9.0 lb). Size of the birds varies with location. The farther the bird is from the equator, the larger it will be. The largest eagles are from Alaska. The bald eagle builds the largest nest of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to 4 m (13 ft) deep, 2.5 m (8.2 ft) wide, and 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) in weight. Bald eagles are sexually mature at four or five years of age. Their courtship involves elaborate, spectacular calls and flight displays. The flight includes swoops, chases, and cartwheels, in which they fly high, lock talons, and free fall, separating just before hitting the ground. Eagles produce between one and three eggs per year, two being typical. Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs, but the female does most of the incubation. The parent not incubating will hunt for food or look for nesting material during this stage. Eggs hatch from mid April to early May, and the young fledge late June to early July. The young eaglets pick up and play with sticks, play tug of war with each other, practice holding things in their talons, and stretch and flap their wings. By eight weeks, the eaglets are strong enough to flap their wings, lift their feet off the nest platform, and rise up in the air. Juvenile eagles first start leaving their parents about 8 weeks after they fledge. Variability in departure date is related to the effects of sex and hatching order on growth and development. For the next four years, immature eagles wander widely in search of food until they attain adult plumage and are eligible to reproduce. The bird's range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the continental United States, and northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply. It prefers tall, old-growth coniferous or deciduous trees for nesting. The bald eagle eats mostly fish. To hunt fish, the eagle swoops down over the water and snatches the fish out of the water with its talons. The bird eats by holding the fish in one claw and tearing the flesh with the other. Small mammals such as rabbits and raccoons may also be eaten if the opportunity arises. The bald eagle will aggressively defend its catch against animals such as coyotes and other birds of prey. The average lifespan of bald eagles in the wild is around 20 years, with the oldest confirmed one having been 28 years of age. They may live longer in captivity. One captive eagle lived 50 years. Eagles die from a variety of causes in the wild including impact with wires and vehicles, trapping, hunting, electrocution, poisoning, starvation, disease, and other undetermined causes. Eagle-shooting is believed to be much reduced due to the protected status of the species.",Easy

"The Pope is the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church and Bishop of Rome. He is also the head of Vatican City, the smallest independent state, which is fully enclosed within Rome. The word pope derives from the Latin papa and Greek πάππας (pappas), meaning father. It has been used at least since the 3rd century to refer to bishops, with the first appearance in English during the 10th century. In the Roman Catholic Church, the title of pope has been officially reserved to the bishop of Rome since the 11th century. In the early days of Christianity, the Church was conducted by the apostles (Jesus' companions), with Saint Peter at their head. That role of the apostles has been pursued by the bishops, with the bishop of Rome (now called pope) leading them all. The pope has had a decreasing role in politics throughout European history, but still maintains close ties with many Catholic monarchs and is welcome to advise them.

"""Chinese characters"" (漢字 in Traditional Chinese, Kanji, Hanja and Chữ Nôm) (汉字 in Simplified Chinese) refers to a writing system that is used in a group of Asian Languages. Unlike most writing systems used today, Chinese characters represent words or phrases, but the pronunciation is (obviously) very different depending on the language. There are believed to be 106,230 characters, but the vast majority are obsolete and are often very hard to find outside of ancient textbooks and dictionaries. 𣡿 and 𦆱 are 2 examples. Chinese characters have been in use for at least 3000 years, so it is one of the oldest writing systems still in use. According to Chinese legend, Chinese characters were invented by a man named Cangjie, who had 4 eyes. Chinese characters are used to write: Chinese characters are the only writing system used in China Mainland, Taiwan, Macau and Hong Kong. Kids in these places will often start off by learning Pinyin, which is a form of the Latin alphabet, and will then go on to learn Chinese characters. The reason Chinese characters are used instead of pinyin is because too many words in Chinese are pronounced similarly. There are 2 forms of Chinese Characters used here, Simplified and Traditional. In 1949 dictator Mao Zedong made attempts to make Chinese characters easier to write so more people could read. China prefers to use Simplified characters, but Traditional is used elsewhere. Typical Chinese speakers know around 8,000. In Japan, Chinese characters, which are referred to as ""Kanji"" are not the only writing system however, as it is used along two other writing systems, Hiragana and Katakana, which represent syllables. Although Chinese characters were used in Korea and Vietnam, they no longer see very much use. In Korea, Chinese characters, which were referred to as Hanja, were largely replaced by Hangul in the 20th Century, but Hangul had previously existed since 1446. However, many argue that the Korean language should be written with both Hanja and Hangul. The use of Hanja is a very divisive issue in Korea, especially South Korea. Hanja today is mainly used for abbreviations. In Vietnam, Chinese Characters, referred to as Chữ Nôm, were replaced with Latin script in the 1920's, and Chữ Nôm is mainly taught in college or used for decorations.",Easy

"Yvette Guilbert (French pronunciation: ; born Emma Laure Esther Guilbert, 20 January 1865 – 3 February 1944) was a French cabaret singer and actress of the Belle Époque. Born in Paris into a poor family as Emma Laure Esther Guilbert, she began singing, as a child but at age 16 worked as a model at the Printemps department store in Paris. She was discovered by a journalist. She took acting and diction lessons, which enabled her in 1886 to appear on stage at several smaller venues. Guilbert debuted at the Varieté Theatre in 1888. She eventually sang at the popular Eldorado club, then at the Jardin de Paris before headlining in Montmartre at the Moulin Rouge in 1890. The English painter William Rothenstein described this performance in his first volume of memoirs: One evening Lautrec came up to the rue Ravignan to tell us about a new singer, a friend of Xanrof, who was to appear at the Moulin Rouge for the first time... We went; a young girl appeared, of virginal aspect, slender, pale, without rouge. Her songs were not virginal – on the contrary; but the frequenters of the Moulin were not easily frightened; they stared bewildered at this novel association of innocence with Xanrof's horrific double entendre; stared, stayed and broke into delighted applause. For her act, she was usually dressed in bright yellow with long gloves and stood almost perfectly still, gesturing with her long arms as she sang. An innovator, she favored monologue-like ""patter songs"" (as they came to be called) and often was billed as a ""diseuse"" or ""sayer"". The lyrics (some of them her own) were raunchy; their subjects were tragedy, lost love, and the Parisian poverty from which she had come. During the 1890s she appeared regularly alongside Kam-Hill, another star of the time, often singing songs by Tarride. Taking her cue from the new cabaret performances, Guilbert broke and rewrote all the rules of music-hall with her audacious lyrics, and the audiences loved her. She was noted in France, England, and the United States at the beginning of the 20th century for her songs and imitations of the common people of France. Author Patrick Bade believed that Guilbert ""derived her trademark black gloves from Pornocrates"" a famous painting by symbolist artist Félicien Rops. She was a favorite subject of artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, who made many portraits and caricatures of Guilbert and dedicated his second album of sketches to her. Sigmund Freud attended her performances, including one in Vienna, and called her a favorite singer. George Bernard Shaw wrote a review highlighting her novelty. The reviews were not all positive. The playwright and songwriter Maurice Lefèvre said of her Let's enter the Chanson Moderne. There she is! Long leech, sexless! She crawls, creeps with hissings, leaving behind the moiré trail of her drool...On both sides of the boneless body hang, like pitiful wrecks, tentacles in funereal gloves. For she will, indeed, lead the burial of our Latin race. Complete negation of our genius...Poor little Chanson, faithful mirror in which men reflect themselves, are you responsible for their hideousness?"" In 1897, she married Max Schiller, an impresario. Guilbert made successful tours of England and Germany, and the United States in 1895–1896. She performed at Carnegie Hall in New York City. Even in her fifties, her name still had drawing power and she appeared in several silent films (including a star turn in F. W. Murnau's Faust). She also appeared in sound fims, including a role with friend Sacha Guitry. Her recordings for La Voix de son maître include the famous ""Le Fiacre"" as well as some of her own compositions such as ""Madame Arthur"". She accompanied herself on piano for some numbers. She once gave a performance for the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, at a private party on the French Riviera. Hostesses vied to have her at their parties. In later years, Guilbert turned to writing about the Belle Époque, and in 1902, two of her novels (La Vedette and Les Demi-vieilles) were published. In the 1920s, there appeared her instructional book L'art de chanter une chanson (The art of singing a Song). She also conducted schools for young girls in New York and Paris. One of her pupils in Paris was the American soprano and folk song fieldworker Loraine Wyman. Another was Pamela Gibson, who became a senior archivist at Bletchley Park during the Second World War. Guilbert became a respected authority on her country's medieval folklore and on 9 July 1932 was awarded the Legion of Honor as the Ambassadress of French Song. Yvette Guilbert died in 1944, aged 79, in Aix-en-Provence. She was interred in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

"The Bridgeport Traction Company was a streetcar transit company in the area around Bridgeport, Connecticut. The company was incorporated in 1893 through the consolidation of the Bridgeport Horse Railroad Company, Bridgeport Railway Company, and the East End Railway Company. The East End Railway Company was established in 1895 as the Bridgeport and West Stratford Horse Railroad Company. The Bridgeport Horse Railroad Company was incorporated in 1864. The Bridgeport Railway Company was formed in 1893. At the time, streetcars were a more affordable form of transportation for those commuting between Bridgeport and Norwalk. Using streetcars to get to their destination was half the price of using the train. In 1899 president Andrew Radel formed a company that was intended to control the world's oyster trade. In 1901, Bridgeport Traction Company was sold to the Connecticut Railway and Lighting Company. From 1906 to 1936, its routes were controlled by the Connecticut Company, a subsidiary of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad which controlled many of the streetcar operators across the state. The leases on the former Connecticut Railway and Lighting Co. routes were voided in 1936 for nonpayment while the New Haven was in receivership. CR&L resumed operation under its own name, and streetcar lines in Bridgeport, Derby, and Waterbury were replaced with buses in 1937. Bus transit operations continued until 1972.

"Jacob Jan ""Jaap"" Metz (6 August 1941 – 27 May 2016) was a Dutch politician. He was a member of the House of Representatives for the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy between 1982 and 1986. Before his time in office Metz was a journalist at De Telegraaf. Metz was born on 6 August 1941 in Amsterdam. After completing his primary and secondary education in Amsterdam Metz started working for the newspaper De Telegraaf in 1962. He started as financial-economic editor and later also worked on police news. He had a three-year stint as journalist at Algemeen Handelsblad from 1969 to 1972 and then returned to De Telegraaf where he became head of the newsservice. Metz quit his job in 1982 and became politically active in the municipal council of Opmeer in September. On 22 November he also became member of the House of Representatives for the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy. Shortly before being sworn in as a member of the House of Representatives information surfaced on paid advice Metz had given to a real estate company while working for De Telegraaf. Metz allegedly influenced information that was published on the company in the newspaper and came to blows with fellow journalist Peter R. de Vries. Party fraction leader Ed Nijpels accepted Metz' explanation that the advice given did not concern core business of the company.

"Central Jersey Regional Airport (IATA: JVI, FAA LID: 47N) is a privately owned, public use airport in Somerset County, New Jersey, United States. The airport is onenautical mile (2km) south of the central business district of Manville. It is located in Hillsborough Township and was formerly known as Kupper Airport. This facility is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a general aviation reliever airport. On the airport property is the Van Nest – Weston Burying Ground, a small cemetery. The airport was originally owned by Charles Kupper who was a real estate investor and managed by Manville Aviation. One of the notable features of the airport is stiff crosswinds from the northwest, making landing challenging at times. The airport originally sold 80LL and 100LL aviation fuel. During the late 1960s into the early 1970s, a short 2,000 foot unimproved or grass runway was constructed running perpendicular to the paved runway starting approximately 100' NE of the beginning of runway 7, extending southeast. Central Jersey Regional Airport covers an area of 119 acres (48 ha) at an elevation of 86 feet (26 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 725 with an asphalt surface measuring 3,507 by 50 feet (1,069 x 15 m). For the 12-month period ending September 7, 2022, the airport had 46,300 general aviation aircraft operations, an average of 127 per day. At that time, there were 90 aircraft based at this airport: 87 single-engine, and 3 multi-engine. This article about an airport in New Jersey is a stub.

"James Patrick Vowles (born 20 June 1979) is a British motorsport engineer and Team Principal of Williams Racing. Before joining Williams, he was the motorsport strategy director at Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team. He was also responsible for the Brawn GP race strategy, which was critical to the team's championship-winning 2009 season. He has worked in Formula One for over 20 years, including under the leadership of team principals David Richards, Ross Brawn, and Toto Wolff, and has played a key role in nine Constructors' Championships, eight Drivers' Championships and over 100 Grands Prix wins. Vowles attended the International School of Geneva, graduating in 1997 with an International Baccalaureate. He went on to the University of East Anglia, obtaining a degree in computer science in 2000,. During his studies, he sought opportunities in various Formula One teams, aiming to apply his mathematical expertise in the racing industry; however, he encountered rejection from all of them, as they did not require mathematicians at the time. Some of the rejection letters suggested him to obtain an engineering degree instead, if he wanted to have a better chance in the sport. He pursued his passion for motorsport by earning a master's degree in Motorsport Engineering and Management from Cranfield University in 2001. As a student at Cranfield, he contributed to a project that won the Prodrive Award of Excellence for designing a racing car for the Jim Russell Racing School. The award ceremony was attended by several Formula One teams and he received multiple job offers the following day. He started his career in Formula One with British American Racing in 2001 and stayed with the team through its transitions to Honda Racing F1, Brawn GP, and Mercedes. During his career in F1, he has worked with world champions Jacques Villeneuve, Jenson Button, Michael Schumacher, Lewis Hamilton, and Nico Rosberg. In February 2023, he became team principal at Williams Racing. Vowles was the chief strategist of Brawn GP, a team that competed in the 2009 season. He was responsible for planning and executing the race strategy for the team's drivers, Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello. Vowles played a key role in Brawn GP's remarkable success, as the team won eight races and both the drivers' and constructors' championships in its debut and only season. He also helped to overcome some of the challenges that Brawn GP faced, such as a limited budget and a late start to testing. Vowles stayed with Brawn when it was bought by Mercedes at the end of 2009. Vowles, who was once seen as a potential successor to Toto Wolff as Mercedes team principal, was one of the key figures behind Mercedes' unprecedented success in Formula One from 2014 to 2021, winning eight consecutive constructors' championships and seven drivers' titles with Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. He was promoted from Chief Strategist to Motorsport Strategy Director in 2019, and was responsible for overseeing the race strategy, performance analysis, and simulation departments. Vowles was also known for his radio communications with the drivers during the races, often providing crucial information and guidance. In January 2023, he announced he was leaving Mercedes to become the team principal of Williams Racing, replacing Jost Capito who stepped down in December 2022. In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, Vowles said that he felt ""too comfortable"" at Mercedes and was looking for a new challenge. He described the offer of team principal at Williams as an ""opportunity of a lifetime"". Vowles said he was honoured to join Williams, an icon of the sport, and looked forward to the challenge of reviving their fortunes. He is only the third team principal in the team's history. In July 2017, Vowles received an honorary degree of Doctor of Science for his achievements in motorsport from the University of East Anglia. In his acceptance speech, he described Formula 1 as his profession, passion, and life. In reference to George Washington Burnap's essentials of happiness, he named Formula 1 as one of the three key ingredients to his personal happiness. In the 2022 Asian Le Mans Series, he drove for the Garage 59 team. Vowles grew up in Switzerland and speaks French fluently. He currently lives in Oxford with his partner and their daughter.

"In the 1860s, the Copperheads, also known as Peace Democrats, were a faction of the Democratic Party in the Union who opposed the American Civil War and wanted an immediate peace settlement with the Confederates. Republicans started labeling anti-war Democrats ""Copperheads"" after the eastern copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix), a species of venomous snake. Those Democrats embraced the moniker, reinterpreting the copper ""head"" as the likeness of Liberty, which they cut from Liberty Head large cent coins and proudly wore as badges. By contrast, Democratic supporters of the war were called War Democrats. Notable Copperheads included two Democratic Congressmen from Ohio: Reps. Clement L. Vallandigham and Alexander Long. Republican prosecutors accused some prominent Copperheads of treason in a series of trials in 1864. Copperheadism was a highly contentious grassroots movement. It had its strongest base just north of the Ohio River and in some urban ethnic wards. In the State of Ohio, perhaps in contrast with Indiana and Illinois, the counties that had Peace Democrat majorities tended to not be along the Ohio River, but more in the central and northwestern portions of the state. Historians such as Wood Gray, Jennifer Weber and Kenneth M. Stampp have argued that it represented a traditionalistic element alarmed at the rapid modernization of society sponsored by the Republican Party and that it looked back to Jacksonian democracy for inspiration. Weber argues that the Copperheads damaged the Union war effort by opposing conscription, encouraging desertion, and forming conspiracies. Still, other historians say that the draft was already in disrepute and that the Republicans greatly exaggerated the conspiracies for partisan reasons. Historians such as Gray and Weber argue that the Copperheads were inflexibly rooted in the past and were naive about the refusal of the Confederates to return to the Union. Convinced that the Republicans were ruining the traditional world they loved, they were obstructionist partisans. In turn, the Copperheads became a significant target of the National Union Party in the 1864 presidential election, where they were used to discredit the leading Democratic candidates. Copperhead support increased when Union armies did poorly and decreased when they won great victories. After the fall of Atlanta in September 1864, Union military success seemed assured, and Copperheadism collapsed. A possible origin of the name came from a New York Times newspaper account in April 1861 that stated that when postal officers in Washington, D.C., opened a mail bag from a state now in the Confederacy: A day or two since, when one of the mail-bags coming from the South by way of Alexandria, was emptied in the court-yard of the Post-office, a box fell out and was broken open, – from which two copperheads, one four and a half and the other three feet long, crawled out. The larger one was benumbed and easily killed; the other was very lively and venomous, and was dispatched with some difficulty and danger. What are we to think of a people who resort to such weapons of warfare. During the American Civil War (1861–1865), the Copperheads nominally favored the Union and strongly opposed the war, about which they faulted abolitionists. They demanded immediate peace and resisted draft laws. They wanted President Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans ousted from power, seeing the President as a tyrant destroying American republican values with despotic and arbitrary actions. Some Copperheads tried to persuade Union soldiers to desert. They talked of helping Confederate prisoners of war seize their camps and escape. They sometimes met with Confederate agents and took money. The Confederacy encouraged their activities whenever possible. The Copperheads had numerous important newspapers, but the editors never allied. In Chicago, Wilbur F. Storey made the Chicago Times into Lincoln's most vituperative enemy. The New York Journal of Commerce, originally abolitionist, was sold to owners who became Copperheads, giving them an important voice in the largest city. A typical editor was Edward G. Roddy, owner of the Uniontown, Pennsylvania Genius of Liberty. He was an intensely partisan Democrat who saw African Americans as an inferior race and Lincoln as a despot and dunce. Although he supported the war effort in 1861, he blamed abolitionists for prolonging the war and denounced the government as increasingly despotic. By 1864, he was calling for peace at any price. John Mullaly's Metropolitan Record was the official Catholic newspaper in New York City. Reflecting Irish American opinion, it supported the war until 1863 before becoming a Copperhead organ. In the spring and summer of 1863, the paper urged its Irish working-class readers to pursue armed resistance to the draft passed by Congress earlier in the year. When the draft began in the city, working-class European Americans, largely Irish, responded with violent riots from July 13 to 16, lynching, beating and hacking to death more than 100 black New Yorkers and burning down black-owned businesses and institutions, including the Colored Orphan Asylum, an orphanage for 233 black children. On August 19, 1864, John Mullaly was arrested for inciting resistance to the draft. Even in an era of extremely partisan journalism, Copperhead newspapers were remarkable for their angry rhetoric. Wisconsin newspaper editor Marcus M. Pomeroy of the La Crosse Democrat referred to Lincoln as ""Fungus from the corrupt womb of bigotry and fanaticism"" and a ""worse tyrant and more inhuman butcher than has existed since the days of Nero ... The man who votes for Lincoln now is a traitor and murderer ... And if he is elected to misgovern for another four years, we trust some bold hand will pierce his heart with dagger point for the public good"". The Copperheads sometimes talked of violent resistance and, in some cases, started to organize. However, they never actually made an organized attack. As war opponents, Copperheads were suspected of disloyalty, and their leaders were sometimes arrested and held for months in military prisons without trial. One famous example was General Ambrose Burnside's 1863 General Order Number 38, issued in Ohio, which made it an offense (to be tried in military court) to criticize the war in any way. The order was used to arrest Ohio congressman Clement L. Vallandigham when he criticized the order itself. However, Lincoln commuted his sentence while requiring his exile to the Confederacy. Probably the largest Copperhead group was the Knights of the Golden Circle. Formed in Ohio in the 1850s, it became politicized in 1861. It reorganized as the Order of American Knights in 1863 and again in early 1864 as the Order of the Sons of Liberty, with Vallandigham as its commander. One leader, Harrison H. Dodd, advocated the violent overthrow of the governments of Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, and Missouri in 1864. Democratic Party leaders and a Federal investigation thwarted his ""Northwest Conspiracy"". Despite this Copperhead setback, tensions remained high. The Charleston Riot took place in Illinois in March 1864. Indiana Republicans then used the sensational revelation of an antiwar Copperhead conspiracy by elements of the Sons of Liberty to discredit Democrats in the 1864 House elections. The military trial of Lambdin P. Milligan and other Sons of Liberty revealed plans to set free the Confederate prisoners held in the state. The culprits were sentenced to hang, but the Supreme Court intervened in Ex parte Milligan, saying they should have received civilian trials. Most Copperheads actively participated in politics. On May 1, 1863, former Congressman Vallandigham declared the war was being fought not to save the Union but to free the blacks and enslave Southern whites. The U.S. Army then arrested him for declaring sympathy for the enemy. He was court-martialed by the Army and sentenced to imprisonment, but Lincoln commuted the sentence to banishment behind Confederate lines. The Democrats nevertheless nominated him for governor of Ohio in 1863. He left the Confederacy and went to Canada, where he campaigned for governor but lost after an intense battle. He operated behind the scenes at the 1864 Democratic convention in Chicago. This convention adopted a largely Copperhead platform and selected Ohio Representative George Pendleton (a known Peace Democrat) as the vice-presidential candidate. However, it chose a pro-war presidential candidate, General George B. McClellan. The contradiction severely weakened the party's chances to defeat Lincoln. The values of the Copperheads reflected the Jacksonian democracy of an earlier agrarian society. The Copperhead movement attracted Southerners who had settled north of the Ohio River, and the poor and merchants who had lost profitable Southern trade. They were most numerous in border areas, including southern parts of Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana (in Missouri, comparable groups were avowed Confederates). The movement had scattered bases of support outside the lower Midwest. A Copperhead element in Connecticut dominated the Democratic Party there. The Copperhead coalition included many Irish American Catholics in eastern cities, mill towns and mining camps (especially in the Pennsylvania coal fields). They were also numerous in German Catholic areas of the Midwest, especially Wisconsin. Historian Kenneth Stampp has captured the Copperhead spirit in his depiction of Congressman Daniel W. Voorhees of Indiana: There was an earthy quality in Voorhees, ""the tall sycamore of the Wabash."" On the stump his hot temper, passionate partisanship, and stirring eloquence made an irresistible appeal to the western Democracy . His bitter cries against protective tariffs and national banks, his intense race prejudice, his suspicion of the eastern Yankee, his devotion to personal liberty, his defense of the Constitution and State's rights faithfully reflected the views of his constituents. Like other Jacksonian agrarians, he resented the political and economic revolution then in progress. Voorhees idealized a way of life that he thought was being destroyed by the current rulers of his country. His bold protests against these dangerous trends made him the idol of the Democracy of the Wabash Valley. Two central questions have run through the historiography of the Copperheads, i.e., ""How serious a threat did they pose to the Union war effort and hence to the nation's survival?"" and ""to what extent and with what justification did the Lincoln administration and other Republican officials violate civil liberties to contain the perceived menace?"". The first book-length scholarly treatment of the Copperheads was The Hidden Civil War: The Story of the Copperheads (1942) by Wood Gray: in it, Gray decried the ""defeatism"" of the Copperheads and argued that they deliberately served the Confederacy's war aims. Also in 1942, George Fort Milton published Abraham Lincoln and the Fifth Column, which likewise condemned the traitorous Copperheads and praised Lincoln as a model defender of democracy. Gilbert R. Tredway, a professor of history, in his 1973 study Democratic Opposition to the Lincoln Administration in Indiana found most Indiana Democrats were loyal to the Union and desired national reunification. He documented Democratic counties in Indiana having outperformed Republican counties in recruiting soldiers. Tredway found that Copperhead sentiment was uncommon among the rank-and-file Democrats in Indiana. The chief historians who favored the Copperheads are Richard O. Curry and Frank L. Klement. Klement devoted most of his career to debunking the idea that the Copperheads represented a danger to the Union. Klement and Curry have downplayed the treasonable activities of the Copperheads, arguing the Copperheads were traditionalists who fiercely resisted modernization and wanted to return to the old ways. Klement argued in the 1950s that the Copperheads' activities, especially their supposed participation in treasonous anti-Union secret societies, were mostly false inventions by Republican propaganda machines designed to discredit the Democrats at election time. Curry sees Copperheads as poor traditionalists battling against the railroads, banks, and modernization. In his standard history Battle Cry of Freedom (1988), James M. McPherson asserted Klement had taken ""revision a bit too far. There was some real fire under that smokescreen of Republican propaganda"". Jennifer Weber's Copperheads: The Rise and Fall of Lincoln's Opponents in the North (2006) agrees more with Gray and Milton than with Klement. She argues that first, Northern antiwar sentiment was strong, so strong that Peace Democrats came close to seizing control of their party in mid-1864. Second, she shows the peace sentiment led to deep divisions and occasional violence across the North. Third, Weber concluded that the peace movement deliberately weakened the Union military effort by undermining both enlistment and the operation of the draft. Indeed, Lincoln had to divert combat troops to retake control of New York City from the anti-draft rioters in 1863. Fourth, Weber shows how the attitudes of Union soldiers affected partisan battles back home. The soldiers' rejection of Copperheadism and overwhelming support for Lincoln's reelection in 1864 was decisive in securing the Northern victory and the preservation of the Union. The Copperheads' appeal, she argues, waxed and waned with Union failures and successes in the field.",Normal

"The Perry Farm is an intact, historic African-American farm complex in Riley Hill, North Carolina, a suburb of Raleigh. The farm house was built in 1820 by John and Nancy Perry, white slaveholders of several slaves during the Antebellum period of the South. After the Civil War ended, a freedman named Feggins Perry made arrangements with his former enslavers to work the land as a tenant farmer. Each night after work, Feggins made baskets and furniture for extra money so he and his brother could buy land, which was the prime goal of many freedmen. Feggins Perry also helped establish the nearby Riley Hill Baptist Church for freedmen. In 1914, Feggins' son Guyon Perry purchased Perry Farm. The property remains in the family to this day.

"Philippe-François Bart (28 February 1706 – 12 March 1784) Grandson of Admiral Jean Bart, was a French naval officer who was Governor of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) from 1757 to 1761 during the Seven Years' War. Philippe-François Bart was born on 28 February 1706 in Dunkirk. His father was the vice-admiral François Cornil Bart (1677–1755), and his grandfather was the privateer Jean Bart (1650–1702). The Bart family had been ennobled by Louis XIV, and the letters of nobility were published in the Mercure de France in October 1694. His mother was Marie Catherine Viguereux (23 August 1686 – 25 November 1741). In 1717 he entered the Collège de Quatre Nations in Paris. His brother Gaspard-François Bart entered the school three years later. Bart joined the Gardes de la Marine in 1722. He was promoted to ship-of-the-line lieutenant (lieutenant de vaisseau) in 1741. He became a ship-of-the-line captain (capitaine de vaisseau) on 1 April 1748. He was Lieutenant de port in Fort Royal (Fort-de-France), Martinique in 1753. On 2 June 1756 in Dunkirk he married Péronne Jeanne Elisabeth Huguet du Hallier (10 January 1737 – 10 May 1774). The naval battle of 20 May 1756 and the taking of Menorca was followed by a formal declaration of war against France by the English. This was the start of the Seven Years' War. The declaration of war was not published in Paris until 16 June. From 29 June to 5 July various notables arrived in Dunkirk to review the situation there and consult with Captain Philippe-François Bart, commander of the navy at Dunkirk, and other heads of service. Bart was appointed Governor and Lieutenant General of Saint-Domingue on 1 October 1756, and was received by the Council of Le Cap on 14 March 1757, and by the Council of Port-au-Prince on 8 July 1757. He replaced Joseph-Hyacinthe de Rigaud. As governor, Bart had to provide continuous support to Prince Joseph de Bauffremont, who commanded the Royal Navy in the French colonies in America. On 16 March 1757 a squadron from France under Bauffremont encountered the 50-gun HMS Greenwich near Samaná Bay, Santo Domingo, and after a two day pursuit captured the ship, which was taken to Saint Domingue. On 5 June 1757 Bauffremont entered Louisbourg with five ships of the line and a frigate from Saint Domingue. Bart and Lalanne noted in a letter of 17 November 1758 that buccaneers, who could have been a great resource, had gradually disappeared since they could not find a living since the war had begun. In the first two years of the war there were no serious shortages in Saint Domingue, but as the English tightened up control, including seizing neutral ships and imposing a blockade, Bart and the intendant Jean-Baptiste Laporte-Lalanne began to fear a famine. Wine and flour were very expensive at Cap François between October 1757 and February 1758, but then became more affordable. Although prices fluctuated considerably, neutral traders and New England Flag of Truce ships maintained supplies. On 13 May 1761 Bart and Clugny issued an ordinance authorizing formation of a commodity market (bourse au commerce) in Le Cap. On 26 July 1757 Bart and Laporte-Lalanne issued an ordinance defining improved postal service in the colony. On 14 February 1759 Bart issued an ordinance concerning choice of blacks to bear arms against enemies of the state, reviving and adapting an ordinance issued on 9 September 1709 by the governor Choiseul and intendant Mithon. The blacks would be rewarded by gifts, pensions or even freedom for the most distinguished actions. Bart and Jean-Etienne-Bernard de Clugny issued an ordinance on 25 April 1761 concerning registration of land titles. Bart wrote in 1761 that a total of 8,000 whites were spread along more than 300 leagues of coastline, while almost 200,000 blacks, their slaves and their enemies, were around them day and night. It was necessary that these 8,000 whites be armed, as well as their women and children. Gabriel de Bory was appointed to succeed Bart on 13 February 1761, and was received by the Council of Le Cap on 30 March 1762. On 1 April 1764 Bart was promoted the squadron commander (chef d'escadre). He retired as squadron leader in 1764. On 1 January 1766 he was appointed a knight of the Order of Saint Louis. Bart died on 12 March 1784 in Paris. He had no children.",Normal

"In logic, negation, also called the logical not or logical complement, is an operation that takes a proposition P {displaystyle P} to another proposition ""not P {displaystyle P} "", standing for "" P {displaystyle P} is not true"", written ¬ P {displaystyle neg P} , ∼ P {displaystyle {mathord {sim }}P} or P ¯ {displaystyle {overline {P}}} . It is interpreted intuitively as being true when P {displaystyle P} is false, and false when P {displaystyle P} is true. Negation is thus a unary logical connective. It may be applied as an operation on notions, propositions, truth values, or semantic values more generally. In classical logic, negation is normally identified with the truth function that takes truth to falsity (and vice versa). In intuitionistic logic, according to the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation, the negation of a proposition P {displaystyle P} is the proposition whose proofs are the refutations of P {displaystyle P} . Classical negation is an operation on one logical value, typically the value of a proposition, that produces a value of true when its operand is false, and a value of false when its operand is true. Thus if statement P {displaystyle P} is true, then ¬ P {displaystyle neg P} (pronounced ""not P"") would then be false; and conversely, if ¬ P {displaystyle neg P} is true, then P {displaystyle P} would be false. The truth table of ¬ P {displaystyle neg P} is as follows: Negation can be defined in terms of other logical operations. For example, ¬ P {displaystyle neg P} can be defined as P → ⊥ {displaystyle Prightarrow bot } (where → {displaystyle rightarrow } is logical consequence and ⊥ {displaystyle bot } is absolute falsehood). Conversely, one can define ⊥ {displaystyle bot } as Q ∧ ¬ Q {displaystyle Qland neg Q} for any proposition Q (where ∧ {displaystyle land } is logical conjunction). The idea here is that any contradiction is false, and while these ideas work in both classical and intuitionistic logic, they do not work in paraconsistent logic, where contradictions are not necessarily false. In classical logic, we also get a further identity, P → Q {displaystyle Prightarrow Q} can be defined as ¬ P ∨ Q {displaystyle neg Plor Q} , where ∨ {displaystyle lor } is logical disjunction. Algebraically, classical negation corresponds to complementation in a Boolean algebra, and intuitionistic negation to pseudocomplementation in a Heyting algebra. These algebras provide a semantics for classical and intuitionistic logic. The negation of a proposition p is notated in different ways, in various contexts of discussion and fields of application. The following table documents some of these variants: The notation N p {displaystyle Np} is Polish notation. In set theory, ∖ {displaystyle setminus } is also used to indicate 'not in the set of': U ∖ A {displaystyle Usetminus A} is the set of all members of U that are not members of A. Regardless how it is notated or symbolized, the negation ¬ P {displaystyle neg P} can be read as ""it is not the case that P"", ""not that P"", or usually more simply as ""not P"". As a way of reducing the number of necessary parentheses, one may introduce precedence rules: ¬ has higher precedence than ∧, ∧ higher than ∨, and ∨ higher than →. So for example, P ∨ Q ∧ ¬ R → S {displaystyle Pvee Qwedge {neg R}rightarrow S} is short for ( P ∨ ( Q ∧ ( ¬ R ) ) ) → S . {displaystyle (Pvee (Qwedge (neg R)))rightarrow S.} Here is a table that shows a commonly used precedence of logical operators. Within a system of classical logic, double negation, that is, the negation of the negation of a proposition P {displaystyle P} , is logically equivalent to P {displaystyle P} . Expressed in symbolic terms, ¬ ¬ P ≡ P {displaystyle neg neg Pequiv P} . In intuitionistic logic, a proposition implies its double negation, but not conversely. This marks one important difference between classical and intuitionistic negation. Algebraically, classical negation is called an involution of period two. However, in intuitionistic logic, the weaker equivalence ¬ ¬ ¬ P ≡ ¬ P {displaystyle neg neg neg Pequiv neg P} does hold. This is because in intuitionistic logic, ¬ P {displaystyle neg P} is just a shorthand for P → ⊥ {displaystyle Prightarrow bot } , and we also have P → ¬ ¬ P {displaystyle Prightarrow neg neg P} . Composing that last implication with triple negation ¬ ¬ P → ⊥ {displaystyle neg neg Prightarrow bot } implies that P → ⊥ {displaystyle Prightarrow bot } . As a result, in the propositional case, a sentence is classically provable if its double negation is intuitionistically provable. This result is known as Glivenko's theorem. De Morgan's laws provide a way of distributing negation over disjunction and conjunction: Let ⊕ {displaystyle oplus } denote the logical xor operation. In Boolean algebra, a linear function is one such that: If there exists a 0 , a 1 , … , a n ∈ { 0 , 1 } {displaystyle a_{0},a_{1},dots ,a_{n}in {0,1}} , f ( b 1 , b 2 , … , b n ) = a 0 ⊕ ( a 1 ∧ b 1 ) ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ ( a n ∧ b n ) {displaystyle f(b_{1},b_{2},dots ,b_{n})=a_{0}oplus (a_{1}land b_{1})oplus dots oplus (a_{n}land b_{n})} , for all b 1 , b 2 , … , b n ∈ { 0 , 1 } {displaystyle b_{1},b_{2},dots ,b_{n}in {0,1}} . Another way to express this is that each variable always makes a difference in the truth-value of the operation, or it never makes a difference. Negation is a linear logical operator. In Boolean algebra, a self dual function is a function such that: f ( a 1 , … , a n ) = ¬ f ( ¬ a 1 , … , ¬ a n ) {displaystyle f(a_{1},dots ,a_{n})=neg f(neg a_{1},dots ,neg a_{n})} for all a 1 , … , a n ∈ { 0 , 1 } {displaystyle a_{1},dots ,a_{n}in {0,1}} . Negation is a self dual logical operator. In first-order logic, there are two quantifiers, one is the universal quantifier ∀ {displaystyle forall } (means ""for all"") and the other is the existential quantifier ∃ {displaystyle exists } (means ""there exists""). The negation of one quantifier is the other quantifier ( ¬ ∀ x P ( x ) ≡ ∃ x ¬ P ( x ) {displaystyle neg forall xP(x)equiv exists xneg P(x)} and ¬ ∃ x P ( x ) ≡ ∀ x ¬ P ( x ) {displaystyle neg exists xP(x)equiv forall xneg P(x)} ). For example, with the predicate P as ""x is mortal"" and the domain of x as the collection of all humans, ∀ x P ( x ) {displaystyle forall xP(x)} means ""a person x in all humans is mortal"" or ""all humans are mortal"". The negation of it is ¬ ∀ x P ( x ) ≡ ∃ x ¬ P ( x ) {displaystyle neg forall xP(x)equiv exists xneg P(x)} , meaning ""there exists a person x in all humans who is not mortal"", or ""there exists someone who lives forever"". There are a number of equivalent ways to formulate rules for negation. One usual way to formulate classical negation in a natural deduction setting is to take as primitive rules of inference negation introduction (from a derivation of P {displaystyle P} to both Q {displaystyle Q} and ¬ Q {displaystyle neg Q} , infer ¬ P {displaystyle neg P} ; this rule also being called reductio ad absurdum), negation elimination (from P {displaystyle P} and ¬ P {displaystyle neg P} infer Q {displaystyle Q} ; this rule also being called ex falso quodlibet), and double negation elimination (from ¬ ¬ P {displaystyle neg neg P} infer P {displaystyle P} ). One obtains the rules for intuitionistic negation the same way but by excluding double negation elimination. Negation introduction states that if an absurdity can be drawn as conclusion from P {displaystyle P} then P {displaystyle P} must not be the case (i.e. P {displaystyle P} is false (classically) or refutable (intuitionistically) or etc.). Negation elimination states that anything follows from an absurdity. Sometimes negation elimination is formulated using a primitive absurdity sign ⊥ {displaystyle bot } . In this case the rule says that from P {displaystyle P} and ¬ P {displaystyle neg P} follows an absurdity. Together with double negation elimination one may infer our originally formulated rule, namely that anything follows from an absurdity. Typically the intuitionistic negation ¬ P {displaystyle neg P} of P {displaystyle P} is defined as P → ⊥ {displaystyle Prightarrow bot } . Then negation introduction and elimination are just special cases of implication introduction (conditional proof) and elimination (modus ponens). In this case one must also add as a primitive rule ex falso quodlibet. As in mathematics, negation is used in computer science to construct logical statements. The exclamation mark ""!"" signifies logical NOT in B, C, and languages with a C-inspired syntax such as C++, Java, JavaScript, Perl, and PHP. ""NOT"" is the operator used in ALGOL 60, BASIC, and languages with an ALGOL- or BASIC-inspired syntax such as Pascal, Ada, Eiffel and Seed7. Some languages (C++, Perl, etc.) provide more than one operator for negation. A few languages like PLI and Ratfor use ¬ for negation. Most modern languages allow the above statement to be shortened from if (!(r == t)) to if (r!= t), which allows sometimes, when the compilerinterpreter is not able to optimize it, faster programs. In computer science there is also bitwise negation. This takes the value given and switches all the binary 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s. See bitwise operation. This is often used to create ones' complement or ""~"" in C or C++ and two's complement (just simplified to ""-"" or the negative sign since this is equivalent to taking the arithmetic negative value of the number) as it basically creates the opposite (negative value equivalent) or mathematical complement of the value (where both values are added together they create a whole). To get the absolute (positive equivalent) value of a given integer the following would work as the ""-"" changes it from negative to positive (it is negative because ""x < 0"" yields true) To demonstrate logical negation: Inverting the condition and reversing the outcomes produces code that is logically equivalent to the original code, i.e. will have identical results for any input (note that depending on the compiler used, the actual instructions performed by the computer may differ). This convention occasionally surfaces in ordinary written speech, as computer-related slang for not. For example, the phrase !voting means ""not voting"". Another example is the phrase !clue which is used as a synonym for ""no-clue"" or ""clueless"". In Kripke semantics where the semantic values of formulae are sets of possible worlds, negation can be taken to mean set-theoretic complementation (see also possible world semantics for more).",Normal

"A football player or footballer is a sportsperson who plays one of the different types of football. The main types of football are association football, American football, Canadian football, Australian rules football, Gaelic football, rugby league, and rugby union. It has been estimated that there are 250 million association football players in the world, and many play other forms of football. Jean-Pierre Papin has described football as a ""universal language"". Footballers across the world and at almost any level may regularly attract large crowds of spectators, and players are the focal points of widespread social phenomena such as association football culture. Footballers generally begin as amateurs and the best players progress to become professional players. Normally they start at a youth team (any local team) and from there, based on skill and talent, scouts offer contracts. Once signed, some learn to play better football and a few advance to the senior or professional teams. Pay in some top men's leagues is significantly higher than in other jobs. Players in the Premier League earn an average of $3 million per year. In the wealthiest clubs in European football leagues, men earn an average $7.19 million per year. The best players of those clubs can earn up to $260 million per year. However, only a fraction of men's professional football players are paid at this level. Wages may be somewhat more moderate in other divisions and leagues. For example, the average annual salary for footballers in Major League Soccer (MLS) is $530,262 as of May 2023. Average salaries in women's leagues are far lower. For example, players in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), which started in 2012, earn an average of $54,000 per year as of May 2022. For the first time in 2022, the NWSL guaranteed players a living wage. The minimum salary in 2023 is $36,400 to ensure players do not need second or third jobs to survive. A minority of retired footballers continue working full-time in football, for instance as football managers. A 1979 study reported that former first-team ballplayers were over-represented as top-ranking executives in their companies and had greater income mobility than second-teamers and reserves. However, some experience chronic health issues, see below. In association football, there are four traditional types of specialties (positions): goalkeepers (goalies), defenders (full-backs), midfielders (half-backs), and forwards (attackers). Special purpose positions include such performers as sweepers, stoppers, second forwards (under-attackers), wingers, insiders, etc. The American football teams' positions are categorized by a form of play where each of them has its spectrum of positions. Those are offensive, defensive, and special teams. Research shows that association football players who take less than 200 milliseconds after the referee blows their whistle to make a penalty kick are significantly less likely to score than those who take over a second. An Irish 2002 study of association and Gaelic football players characterized players as ""lean and muscular with a reasonably high level of capacity in all areas of physical performance"". The opposite is the case for American football, where obesity could be the cause of grave health problems. A 2000 study documented injuries sustained by Czech  football players at all levels: Trauma was the cause of 81.5% of the injuries, and overuse was the cause of 18.5%. Joint sprains predominated (30%), followed by fractures (16%), muscle strains (15%), ligament ruptures (12%), meniscal tears and contusions (8%), and other injuries. Injuries to the knee were most prevalent (29%), followed by injuries to the ankle (19%) and spine (9%). More injuries occurred during games (59%) than in practice.  Patellar tendinitis (knee pain) is considered an injury that comes from overexertion, which also happens to other athletes of virtually every sport. It is a common problem that football players develop and can usually be treated by a quadriceps strengthening program. Jumping activities place particularly high strains on the tendon and with repetitive jumping, tearing and injury of the tendon can occur. The chronic injury and healing response results in inflammation and localized pain. Although levels of depression and pain in retired football players are on par with the societal average, some players suffer from post-retirement chronic injuries. Head injuries are a particular concern. Studies have long shown former American football NFL players have a longer life expectancy than the general public or males with a similar age and race distribution, but a higher rate of cardiovascular issues. A study comparing the deaths of former Major League Baseball players found baseball players lived longer still, perhaps suggesting a ""healthy worker"" bias where NFL athletes lived less long than they would otherwise have, despite their longer than average life expectancy. A 2009 review of the evidence in the American Journal of Medicine concluded the existing evidence ""did not suggest an increased mortality"" but does ""suggest increased cardiovascular risk..., particularly the heavier linemen."" In association football, a 2011 German study found that German national team players lived 1.9 years less than the general male population. Football players participating in international matches for Germany have reduced longevity compared to the general population. This disadvantage was the larger, the earlier the international football player started his international career. This finding is in line with the current knowledge of life expectancy in major athletes, especially those from other team sports A 1983 study of rugby players found that the life expectancy of All Blacks was the same as for the general population. Australian rules footballers have lower death rates than the general population. American football players are prone to head injuries such as concussions. In later life, this increases the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's. Professional American football players self-reporting concussions are at greater risk for having depressive episodes later in life compared with those retired players self-reporting no concussions. Probably due to the repeated trauma associated with heading balls, professional association football has been suggested to increase the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In a 1987 study of former Norwegian association football national team players, one third of the players were found to have central cerebral atrophy, i.e. brain damage. A 1999 study connected soccer to chronic traumatic head injury (CTHI): articipation in amateur association football in general and concussion specifically is associated with impaired performance in memory and planning functions. Due to the worldwide popularity of soccer, these observations may have important public health implications Anterior cruciate ligaments are particularly vulnerable in most types of football due to injuries that can be sustained during tackles. An increased incidence of osteoarthritis in the hip joint has been found in retired football players. A 2012 study of association football injuries found that 19% of all injuries were muscle injuries, of which 54% affected the thigh muscles. In a 2009 study, association football was found to be associated with favourable sleep patterns and psychological functioning in adolescent male football players. The rate of suicide among NFL vets has been found to be 59% lower than in the general population. In 2012, FIFA released a paper intended to identify key risk factors for association football players. In 2015, a systematic review of a sample of fifty-four peer-reviewed publications and three articles on elite athletes’ mortality and longevity, resulted in major longevity outcomes for the elite athletes (baseball, football, soccer, basketball, and cycling) ""compared to age and sex-matched controls from the general population and other athletes."" The span longevities were influenced by factors like the type of sport, the playing position, the race, and the energy system. An observational study held from professional footballers -active (during their career) and recently retired (post-career, aged more than 45 years)- in 70 countries between 2007 and 2013, elaborated on data from the World Footballers' Union (FIFPro), recorded 214 deaths of which 25% was caused by accidents, 11% by suicides and 33% by a suspected cardiac pathology (on an overall 55% of deaths caused by some sort of disease). Clinical evaluation, ECG , and echocardiography are required for the athletes as pre-participation tools in order to prevent sudden cardiac deaths in people aged less than 35. To evaluate the risk of myocardial fibrosis, may use and recommend the additional use of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with pre- and post-contrast and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) images. Even encouraged, it wasn't yet made mandatory. In 2015, 205 deaths among North American professional athletes who were registered as active at the time of their decease were analysed. Data were collected for the four major sports: National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL), National Hockey League (NHL), and Major League Baseball (MLB). The NFL and NBA active players had ""a higher likelihood of dying in a car accident"" and a significantly higher likelihood of dying from a cardiac-related illness compared to the NHL and MLB active populations. In 2013, a study on 3,439 retired athletes of the National Football Leagues with at least five credited playing seasons between 1959 and 1988 did not show a statistical correlation between suicide mortality and professional activity, particularly football-related compared with the general control sample. No stratification was reported between speed and non-speed position players. Until the 2000s a very limited number of formal studies has been published on mortality from all causes in soccer players, despite the high interest of the public to the matter. An extended study held in Italy between 1975 and 2003 on a total of 5.389 players, aged 14–35 years, highlighted that, while the mortality for cancer and cardiovascular diseases among the football players cohort was significantly lower than the general Italian population, the ""mortality rates for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and car accidents were significantly higher than expected, and for ALS the risk is 18 times than expected.""",Normal

A cable dated 17 December 2010 sent from the US embassy in Australia was released to Italian investigative journalist Stefania Maurizi in December 2023 under freedom of information. The US cable concerned reactions in Australia to the United States diplomatic cables leak. The cable revealed that US officials monitored pro-Assange protests in Australia for ""anti-US sentiment"" and warned that there was ""increasing sympathy, particularly on the left"" for Assange. It described Fullilove as a ""moderating voice"" who, ""while calling the leaks 'fascinating', also termed WikiLeaks' conduct reckless in a blog post. But for the most part, sensationalist headlines are drowning out Fullilove and other reasonable observers.""",Normal
"Sequoyah Country Club is an 18 hole, private equity, member-owned golf course and country club in Oakland, California. Founded in 1913, it hosted the Oakland Open from 1938 to 1944 – one of the premier professional golf tournaments on the Pacific coast, which featured prominently in the early golfing careers of Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Jimmy Demaret, and others. On October 3, 1913, a group of 23 citizens, acting as initial underwriters, held their first meeting at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, California and organized a new golf club. They intentionally chose the traditional Indian spelling of 'Sequoyah' instead of the more commonly used version of the name 'Sequoia'. The nine member board of directors consisted of: This board appointed committee leaders, including the membership committee, whose identity they kept secret. The golf club's bylaws allowed for 350 total members, of which 100 prospective members were already identified. Others who attended the founding meeting included: John C. Shipp, Frank H. Proctor, J.M. Stephens, J.H. Hunt, A.C. Baumbartner, Walter J. Wilson, M.H. Robbins Jr., K.B. Putnam, A.J. Coogan, W.A. Bissell, J.F. Neville, Fred Sherman, E.B. King, W.R. Thorsen, F.E. McGurrin, P.K. Gordon, and E.G. Garden. Several of the early Sequoyah members were also members of Claremont Country Club. Sequoyah is situated on a 180-acre parcel of land that encompasses a 6300-yard golf course with views as far north as Mt. Tamalpais, Golden Gate, and across the bay to Redwood City on the peninsula. The golf course is within an hour of San Francisco or Oakland downtown, and easily accessible by the Southern Pacific Railroad. The land is notable for its gently rolling terrain and soil conditions—sandy loam, with no trace of adobe clay. At 6,100 yards, Sequoyah is short by modern standards, where courses are often 1,000 yards longer. However, it has small, challenging greens, and due to the course's hilly topology, lies are very often uneven. The course record was established in 1955 by PGA professional Don Whitt, who was the club's first assistant golf professional before turning pro. Unlike other local courses from its era, no public roads interrupt the layout. Sequoyah is completely fenced in and there are no homes that openly abut the golf course. It is not unusual to see wild turkey, deer, fox, vultures, eagles and falcons at Sequoyah. The club house was designed by architect Edward G. Garden, with all the amenities consistent with a modern country club for that era—including a main dining room, lunchroom grill, women's dressing room, men's locker room, main living room, sleeping accommodations for resident staff, open air swimming pool, tennis courts, twenty sleeping rooms for members, automobile parking, stables, and a golf pro shop. The original plan also reserved space for a polo field and race track.",Normal

"The Bell AH-1Z Viper is a twin-engine attack helicopter, based on the AH-1W SuperCobra, designed and produced by the American aerospace manufacturer Bell Helicopter. It is one of the latest members of the prolific Bell Huey family. It is often called ""Zulu Cobra"", based on the military phonetic alphabet pronunciation of its variant letter. The AH-1Z was developed during the 1990s and 2000s as a part of the H-1 upgrade program on behalf of the United States Marine Corps (USMC). It is essentially a modernisation of the service's existing AH-1Ws, and was originally intended to be a rebuild program before subsequent orders were made for new-build helicopters instead. The AH-1Z and Bell UH-1Y Venom utility helicopter share a common tailboom, engines, rotor system, drivetrain, avionics architecture, software, controls and displays for over 84% identical components. Furthermore, it features a four-blade, bearingless, composite main rotor system, uprated transmission, and a new target sighting system amongst other improvements. On 8 December 2000, the AH-1Z conducted its maiden flight; low-rate initial production was launched in October 2003. On 30 September 2010, the USMC declared that the AH-1Z had attained combat readiness; it fully replaced the preceding AH-1W Super Cobra during October 2020. The type forms a key element of the Aviation Combat Element (ACE) taskforce which support all phases of USMC expeditionary operations. Since its introduction, the USMC has pursued various upgrades, such as installing Link 16 datalink and outfitting it with the AGM-179A Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM). Additionally, numerous export customers have been sought for the AH-1Z, it has regularly competed with the Boeing AH-64 Apache for orders. The first export customer was the Royal Bahraini Air Force, and the Czech Air Force has also ordered the type. At one point, Pakistan was set to operate its own AH-1Zs, but deliveries were blocked due to political factors. Aspects of the AH-1Z can be traced back to the experimental Bell 249 of 1979, which was essentially an upgraded AH-1S, having been equipped with the four-blade main rotor system from the Bell 412 utility helicopter. The Bell 249 was used as a demonstrator for Bell's Cobra II concept, and made an appearance at the Farnborough Airshow in 1980. As promoted by Bell, the Cobra II was to be equipped with various new and redesigned combat systems, which included the AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missile, a new targeting system, and was also to be powered by improved engines as well. The further-developed Cobra 2000 proposal included the General Electric T700 engine and a four-blade rotor. While Bell's proposal did generate some interest within the US Marine Corps, funding was not forthcoming to pursue its development at that time. During 1993, Bell opted to enter an AH-1W-based variant for the UK's new attack helicopter program. This derivative, which was named the CobraVenom, featured a modern digital cockpit and could carry wire-guided missiles, Hellfire or Brimstone missiles. The CobraVenom design was further refined two years later, notably by the adoption of a four-blade rotor system. However, later that same year, a rival bid for the AH-64D Apache Longbow was selected to fulfil the program instead. In 1996, the USMC launched the H-1 upgrade program by signing a contract with Bell Helicopter for upgrading 180 AH-1Ws into AH-1Zs and upgrading 100 UH-1Ns into UH-1Ys. The H-1 program created completely modernized attack and utility helicopters with considerable design commonality to reduce operating costs. The AH-1Z and UH-1Y share a common tailboom, engines, rotor system, drivetrain, avionics architecture, software, controls and displays for over 84% identical components. Bell participated in a joint government test team during the engineering manufacturing and development phase of the H-1 program. Research and development progressed slowly from 1996 to 2003. The existing two-blade semi-rigid, teetering rotor system was replaced with a four-blade, hingeless, bearingless rotor system. The four-blade configuration provides improvements in flight characteristics including increased flight envelope, maximum speed, vertical rate of climb, payload and reduced rotor vibration level. The AH-1Z first flew on 8 December 2000. Bell delivered three prototype aircraft to the United States Navy's Naval Air Systems Command at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in July 2002, for the flight test phase of the program. Low-rate initial production began in October 2003, with deliveries running through 2018. In late 2006, a contract was awarded to Meggitt Defense Systems to develop a new linkless 20mm ammunition handling system to improve on the gun feed reliability of the existing linked feed system. In February 2008, the U.S. Navy adjusted the contract so the last 40 AH-1Zs were built as new airframes instead of the previously planned rebuild of AH-1Ws. In September 2008, the Navy requested an additional 46 airframes for the Marine Corps, bringing the total number ordered to 226. During 2010, the Marine Corps ordered 189 AH-1Zs, with 58 of them being new airframes, with deliveries to continue until 2022. On 10 December 2010, the Department of the Navy approved the AH-1Z for full-rate production. In November 2022, Bell delivered the 189th AH-1Z to the U.S. Marine Corps, completing the program of record for the Viper. Combined with the 160 UH-1Y airframes which completed delivery in 2018, it marked the final deliveries of the H-1 series rotorcraft for the U.S. military since deliveries began in 1959. The Bell AH-1Z Viper is an attack helicopter derived from the earlier Bell AH-1 SuperCobra. When contrasted against its predecessor, it incorporates various improvements and advances, including new rotor technology, upgraded military avionics, updated weapons systems, and electro-optical sensors in an integrated weapons platform. Amongst other advantages provided by these changes, it has improved survivability and can locate targets at longer ranges and also attack them using precision weapons. The airframe was extensively redesigned to maximise crashworthiness; measures include energy-absorbing landing gear, fuel vapor inerting systems, self-sealing fuel tanks, energy-attenuating crashworthy seating, and a mass retention design approach applied to many major components. Active systems include countermeasure dispensers, radar warning, incomingon-way missile warning, on-fuselage laser spot warning systems, and the Hover Infrared Suppression System (HIRSS) to protect the engine exhausts. The AH-1Z is equipped with a bearingless and hingeless rotor system; this has 75% fewer parts than that of four-bladed articulated systems. The rotor blades are composed of composites, which give them increased ballistic survivability; the rotor is equipped with a semi-automatic folding system, enabling the AH-1Z to be stored more efficiently aboard amphibious assault ships and other means of transportation. Efforts were made to maximise its maintainability and to minimise maintenance requirements; in comparison to the SuperCobra, numerous maintenance tasks have been eliminated, interactive electronic technical manuals have been produced, less spares storage is required, and accessibility has also been improved. Furthermore, various fault detection sensors are present to facilitate condition-based maintenance. The AH-1Z is equipped with a pair of redesigned stub wings, these being substantially longer than those of the preceding SuperCobra. Each one has an additional wingtip station for a missile such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder. Each stub wing has two other stations for 2.75-inch (70mm) Hydra 70 rocket pods, or AGM-114 Hellfire quad missile launchers. The ANAPG-78 Longbow fire control radar can also be mounted on a wingtip station. Similarly, other mission equipment can be fitted to these stations, including 77 and 100 gallon external auxiliary fuel tanks, LUU-2AB nighttime illumination flares, and numerous types of practice munitions. Underneath the nose of the AH-1Z is an AA49E-7 turret fitted with a 20 mm (0.787 in) M197 three-barreled rotary cannon; this weapon has a higher muzzle velocity and flatter trajectory than predecessors; it is also compatible with M50-series air-to-air rounds. The cockpit of the AH-1Z has been designed so that both crewmembers have virtually identical controls; it can be readily flown from either the front or rear positions. These positions incorporate a Hands on Collective and Stick (HOCAS) side-stick architecture, which enables many functions to be carried out by the pilot without moving their hands from the flight controls. Both of the two crew stations are provisioned with a pair of 8×6-inch multifunction liquid crystal displays (LCD) and a single 4.2×4.2-inch dual function LCD. The AH-1Z has an integrated avionics system developed by Northrop Grumman; this system includes two mission computers and an automatic flight control system. The communications suite combines a U.S. Navy RT-1824 integrated radio, UHFVHF, COMSEC and modem into a single unit. The navigation suite includes an embedded GPS inertial navigation system, a digital map system and Meggitt's low-airspeed air data subsystem, which allows weapons delivery when hovering. Crew members are equipped with the Thales ""Top Owl"" helmet-mounted sight and display system. This display provides a 24-hour daynight capability and a binocular display with a 40° field of view; its visor projection provides forward-looking infrared (FLIR) or video imagery. Furthermore, it has been designed from the onset to accommodate in-service upgrades. The Lockheed Martin target sight system (TSS) incorporates a third-generation FLIR sensor which provides target sighting and identification in day, night, or adverse weather conditions. It is a passive sensor, unlike radar, thus is untrackable. The TSS has various view modes and can track with FLIR or by TV. The same system is also used on the KC-130J Harvest HAWK. During May 2005, it was announced that the AH-1Z had completed its first round of sea-based flight trials. On 15 October 2005, the USMC, through the Naval Air Systems Command, accepted delivery of the first AH-1Z production standard helicopter. Both the AH-1Z and UH-1Y completed their developmental testing during early 2006. During the first quarter of 2006, initial examples of the type were transferred to the Operational Test Unit at the NAS Patuxent River to undergo operational evaluation (OPEVAL) testing. In February 2008, both the AH-1Z and UH-1Y began the second and final portion of OPEVAL testing. On 30 September 2010, the USMC declared that the AH-1Z had attained combat readiness. Since the type's introduction, numerous upgrades have been investigated and integrated. During March 2022, it was announced that the AGM-179A Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) has achieved initial operational capability upon the AH-1Z; this munition will replace both the Hellfire and Maverick missiles. As of early 2022, work to install kits to facilitate a Link 16 datalink upon both the AH-1Z and UH-1Y was underway. During October 2020, the USMC announced the withdrawal of the last of its AH-1W Super Cobras; the type has been entirely replaced by AH-1Z Vipers. In USMC service, the AH-1Z forms a key element of the Aviation Combat Element (ACE), a task-orientated force of supporting the USMC throughout all phases of its expeditionary operations; key tasks in this capacity include offensive air support, anti-air warfare, assault support, and aerial reconnaissance. During the early 2020s, there were debates over cutting as much as one-third of the USMC's attack helicopter fleet in order to reallocate budget to other capabilities. In May 2021, even as deliveries continued, several USMC AH-1Zs went into long-term storage at the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) in Arizona as part of a wider restructuring effort. On 27 April 2018, the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced it had received U.S. State Department approval and notified Congress of a possible sale to Bahrain of 12 AH-1Zs, 26 T-700 GE 401C engines, and armaments for an estimated cost of US$911.4 million (~$1.05billion in 2022). In November 2018, Bahrain confirmed the order for 12 AH-1Zs, and the first six were delivered in mid-2022. Production of AH-1Zs for Bahrain were completed in December 2022 and final deliveries will be made in 2023. In 2016, Bell was also interested in selling the AH-1Z to the Czech Republic, which sought to retire its Soviet-era Mil Mi-24 gunships. In December 2019, the Czech Republic finalized the sale with the U.S. of four AH-1Zs for the Czech Air Force. In March 2022, Czech Defense Minister Jana Černochová announced plans to buy further helicopters, attributing this decision to the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine. During the early 2010s, the AH-1Z was being offered to South Korea, competing against the AH-64 Apache and the TAIAgustaWestland T129 ATAK attack helicopters. During April 2013, South Korea announced the selection of the rival AH-64E bid. In April 2015, the U.S. State Department approved a possible Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to Pakistan for 15 AH-1Z Vipers with Hellfire missiles, associated equipment and support worth up to $952 million (~$1.15billion in 2022). In early 2016 Pakistan was reportedly set to receive nine AH-1Zs by September 2018. However, Pakistan's order was placed on hold on account of political tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan. The order for 12 aircraft has not been cancelled; by May 2019, nine have been built but are stored at the 309th AMARG base, awaiting a resolution to the friction between the two countries. During 2016, it was reported that the Royal Moroccan Air Force was interested in procuring a number of AH-1Zs. In November 2016, Bell Helicopter signed a memorandum of understanding with Romanian airspace company IAR – Ghimbav Brasov Group for potential collaboration on the AH-1Z. In August 2017, Romania also signed a letter of intent with Bell Helicopter to establish a joint venture with Romanian state-owned ROMARM for the potential procurement of a number of AH-1Zs. In 2017, Bell promoted both the AH-1Z and the UH-1Y Venom to the Australian Army as a potential replacement for their existing fleet of Eurocopter Tiger attack helicopters. In January 2021, the Australian Government announced that it would purchase the AH-64E Apache to replace its Tigers. In July 2017, Bell Helicopter and Polish Armaments Group signed a letter of intent planning on cooperating on the UH-1Y and AH-1Z helicopters, forming a potential bid for the Polish Kruk attack helicopter acquisition program, part of a wider modernization effort. In March 2022, in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Poland has reportedly delayed a decision on new attack helicopters until after the completion of a sweeping security review. In October 2017, Thailand's minister of Defence Prawit Wongsuwan stated that Thailand is looking onto replacing its fleet of aging AH-1F Cobra attack helicopters and will launch a procurement committee to look into the matter. Royal Thai Army officials have said that they are interested in the AH-1Z, as well as the Agusta A129 Mangusta, Mil Mi-28, CAIC Z-10, Bell AH-1 SuperCobra and Boeing AH-64 Apache. On 30 April 2020, the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced it had received U.S. State Department approval and notified Congress of a possible sale to the Philippines of either six AH-1Z attack helicopters and related equipment for an estimated cost of $450 million or six AH-64E Apache attack helicopters and related equipment for an estimated cost of $1.5 billion. Nigeria has sought to procure AH-1Zs for some time. Sales were initially blocked by Congress over human rights concerns; however, during April 2022, it was announced that the U.S. State Department had given its approval for the sale of the type along with support apparatus via a nearly $1 billion contract. In March 2023, it was announced that Slovakia will receive twelve AH-1Zs at a discount after the nation sent its retired MiG-29 fighters to Ukraine.

"Electroslag remelting (ESR), also known as electro-flux remelting, is a process of remelting and refining steel and other alloys for mission-critical applications in aircraft, thermal power stations, nuclear power plants, military technology and others. The electroslag remelting (ESR) process is used to remelt and refine steels and various super-alloys, resulting in high-quality ingots. This process can be started up through vacuum induction melting. The ESR process uses the as-cast alloy as a consumable electrode. Electric current (generally AC) is passed between the electrode and the new ingot, which is formed in the bottom of a water-cooled copper mold. The new ingot is covered in an engineered slag that is superheated by the electric current. The electrode tip is slowly melted from contact with the slag. These metal droplets travel through the slag to the bottom of the water-cooled mold and slowly freeze as the ingot is directionally solidified upwards from the bottom of the mold. The slag pool floats above the refined alloy, continuously floating upwards as the alloy solidifies. The molten metal is cleaned of impurities that chemically react with the slag or otherwise float to the top of the molten pool as the molten droplets pass through the slag. Electroslag remelting uses highly reactive slags (calcium fluoride, lime, alumina, or other oxides are usually the main components) to reduce the amount of type-A sulfide present in biometal alloys. It is a common practice in European industries. ESR reduces other types of inclusions as well, and is seen as an alternative to the vacuum arc remelting (VAR) method that is prevalent in US industries. An example of the use of the electro-slag refined (ESR) steel technique is the L30 tank gun. CrNi60WTi is a stainless steel which is best formed by either electro-slag remelting or vacuum arc remelting. This alloy can be used for the construction of nuclear power plants.",Normal
"Potamotherium ('river beast') an extinct genus of caniform carnivoran from the Miocene epoch of France and Germany. It has historically been assigned to the family Mustelidae (otters, weasels, etc.), but more recent studies suggest that it represents a primitive relative of pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, etc.) The genus was first described in 1833. Carroll (1988) assigned it to the family Mustelidae as a member of the subfamily Oligobuninae. However, it was recently suggested that Potamotherium was not a mustelid at all, but rather a very basal pinniped. Berta et al. (2018) placed Potamotherium along with Puijila and Semantor in the family Semantoridae. Two species have been identified in the genus: P. valletoni, the type species, and P. miocenicum. Finds range from the mid-latitudes of Europe and North America, dated from the OligoceneMiocene boundary and surviving through to the end of the Miocene. It has been interpreted by several researchers as a basal, non-marine ancestor of seals and sea lions, suggesting a freshwater phase in the evolutionary transition of pinnipeds from land to sea. If Potamotherium was indeed a pinniped instead of a mustelid, its relatives were possibly early bears (whose ancestors at the time were small and generally weasel-like). Physically, Potamotherium resembled a modern otter, and was 1.5 metres (5ft) long, with an elongated, slender body and short legs. With a flexible backbone and a streamlined shape, it was probably a good swimmer. Analysis of fossils suggests that Potamotherium had a poor sense of smell, but made up for this with good vision and hearing. Fossils of Potamotherium are so complete that the shape of the brain can be inferred via a digital endocast of the skull. The coronal gyrus (a fold on the lateral surface of the brain) is broad, slanted backwards and partially split by a small groove. The brain is nearly identical to that of Enaliarctos, an extinct mammal universally agreed to be close to pinnipeds. Modern pinnipeds and the extinct Pinnarctidion have an expanded coronal gyrus with a distinctive vertical orientation. The carnivorans with the largest coronal gyrus are freshwater foragers such as the otter civet (Cynogale bennetti) and certain otter species (in the genera Lutra and Lontra). They primarily emphasize sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) or the lips while hunting, rather than the hands. It is likely that the same was true for Potamotherium. Modern pinnipeds are unique among marine mammals for their large whiskers, which were probably inherited from an ancestor similar to Potamotherium.",Normal

There are 100-day Kwan seum bosal chanting retreats (kido) in every summer, beginning in June. Intensive, 3- to 7-day long retreats called 'Yong Maeng Jeong Jin'.",Normal
"The Soviet guard ship Groza was a Uragan-class guard ship built for the Soviet Navy during the 1920s and 1930s. The ship was one of the Series I ships known officially as Project 2. Initially assigned to the Baltic Fleet, she was transferred to the Northern Flotilla shortly after she was commissioned in 1932 and played a minor role in the 1939–1940 Winter War against Finland. During World War II, Groza initially provided naval gunfire support during Operation Barbarossa for Soviet troops defending the Rybachy Peninsula and then escorted Allied merchant ships in Soviet waters in 1942–1943. The ship briefly served as a target ship in 1952–1953 before being hulked as an accommodation ship in early 1953. The Russian Civil War had shut down design and construction of all ships, both naval and commercial from 1917 to 1924, thus Soviet naval architects and shipyards lacked experience when the Soviet Navy decided to replace the few old Tsarist torpedo boats still in service. The initial requirement was based on that of the later batches of the World War I-era German A-class torpedo boat that could carry mines as necessary to serve as fleet escorts and conduct torpedo attacks. The Uragans were almost 6 knots (11kmh; 6.9mph) slower than designed due to this inexperience and, in their intended role, they ""were complete failures – they were too slow for use as torpedo boats and of no value as ASW vessels because of their lack of depth-charge handling equipment and underwater detection devices"". The Series I Uragan-class ships, officially known as Project 2, displaced 490 metric tons (480 long tons) at standard load and 633t (623 long tons) at full load. They were 71.5m (234ft 7in) long overall, had a beam of 7.4m (24ft 3in) and a draft of 2.95m (9ft 8in). The ships had 14 main watertight compartments and a double bottom only underneath the machinery and boiler rooms. In 1943 Groza's crew numbered 114. The Uragan-class ships were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by a pair of three-drum boilers. The turbines of the Series I ships developed a total of 5,700 shaft horsepower (4,300kW) which gave them a speed in service of 21 knots (39kmh; 24mph). Groza carried 102–116 metric tons (100–114 long tons) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 850 nautical miles (1,570km; 980mi) at 16 knots (30kmh; 18mph). The main armament of the Uragan-class guard ships consisted of a pair of Tsarist-era 102-millimeter (4in) Pattern 1911 guns in single mounts, one each forward and aft of the superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense was intended to be provided by four single 37-millimeter (1.5in) 11-K AA guns; these were modified versions of the British 2-pounder (40mm (1.6in)) guns, but deteriorating relations with the United Kingdom prevented the Soviets from buying any of these weapons. A pair of 7.62-millimeter (0.3in) Maxim machine guns were fitted in their place. A rotating triple mount for 450mm (17.7in) torpedoes was fitted between the funnels. The Uragans were fitted with a pair of racks for 22 B-1 165-kilogram (364lb) and 15 M-1 41-kilogram (90lb) depth charges. Alternatively up to 20 KB mines could be carried using rails mounted on the main deck. No sonar was fitted so dropping depth charges was largely an act of futility. Two K-1 minesweeping paravanes were fitted on the main deck after the design was finalized. One DM-1 2-meter (6ft 7in) rangefinder was mounted above the open bridge and a 1-meter (3ft 3in) searchlight was fitted on a small platform abaft the rear funnel. Beginning in 1934, four semi-automatic 45mm (1.8in) 21-K AA guns in single mounts were being fitted to the Uragans. The 45mm guns were generally mounted fore and aft of each of the 102mm guns. Four years later 12.7mm (0.50in) DShK machine guns began replacing the Maxim machine guns. Around the same time ships began exchanging their 21-Ks for three single mounts for fully automatic 37mm AA guns. These were usually positioned between the forward gun and the bridge, between the searchlight platform and the aft 102mm gun, and abaft the rear gun. Some ships retained one or two of the 21-Ks into the war. When the Soviets began receiving 12.7mm Colt-Browning machine guns through Lend-Lease, they began supplementing the DShKs aboard the Uragans, up to a total of six barrels in four mounts, with one twin-gun Colt-Browning mount replacing the searchlight in some ships. Some Uragans had a pair of BMB-1 depth charge throwers installed on the stern in 1941; Groza received hers on 13 August. Beginning in 1942, gun shields for the 102mm guns were installed. By 1943, the ship had had a British Type 128 sonar installed. Groza was laid down in Shipyard No. 190 (Zhdanov) in Leningrad as yard number 324 on 13 August 1927. She was launched on 28 September 1930 and commissioned on 22 July 1932 into the Baltic Fleet. Construction was delayed by inadequate shipyard facilities, shortages of skilled labor and poor quality control by Soviet industry. Groza, and her sisters Smerch and Uragan, were sent to the White Sea via the newly opened White Sea–Baltic Canal on 26 July 1933 and Groza was assigned to the Northern Flotilla on 21 September. To lighten the ships for passage through shallows their armament was removed, along with much of the moveable deck equipment, and carried in barges that followed the ships. During the Winter War, Groza helped to transport the 104th Rifle Division to occupy Liinakhamari and provided fire support when Petsamo was occupied between 30 November and 2 December 1939. On 2–3 January 1940, the ship escorted two minelayers as they laid a minefield off Petsamo. After the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 (Operation Barbarossa), Groza and her sisters were quite active in mid-1941 providing fire support for Soviet troops defending the Zapadnaya Litsa River and the Rybachy Peninsula. On 6–7 July the ship was part of a force that landed two battalions of naval infantry that counter-attacked German forces driving on Murmansk during Operation Platinum Fox. She bombarded German positions with 36 rounds from her main guns on 1 January 1942. The ship received emergency repairs on 8–13 January and then spent the time between 24 March and 17 June under repair. Groza's crew claimed to have damaged a German U-boat on 10 September, but this has not been substantiated by post-war research. Groza and Uragan were among the Soviet ships that met Convoy JW 53 as it approached Soviet waters in mid-February 1943 and arrived at Kola Inlet on 26 February. The ship was part of the escort for Convoy KB.23 from Murmansk to Archangel on 21–23 September. Six months later Groza escorted Convoy BK.2 as it sailed from Archangel to Murmansk on 5 February 1944. Six days later she is one of the Soviet escorts that rendezvoused with Convoy JW 64 on 11 February. Groza was modernized from 25 November 1943 until December 1944. The ship was converted to serve as a target ship on 12 November 1952 and was hulked as a barracks ship with the name of PRZ-51 on 25 February 1953.",Normal

"Maurice Herbert Evans (3 June 1901 – 12 March 1989) was an English actor, noted for his interpretations of Shakespearean characters. His best-known screen roles include Dr. Zaius in the 1968 film Planet of the Apes and Samantha Stephens's father, Maurice, on Bewitched. Evans was born at 28 Icen Way in Dorchester, Dorset. He was the son of Laura (Turner) and Alfred Herbert Evans, a Welsh dispensing chemist and keen amateur actor who made adaptations of novels by Thomas Hardy for the local amateur company. Young Maurice made his first stage appearance as a small boy in Far from the Madding Crowd. He first appeared on the stage in 1926 at the Cambridge Festival Theatre and joined the Old Vic Company in 1934, playing Hamlet, Richard II, and Iago. He was selected by Terence Gray to appear in the opening production in November 1926 at the Festival Theatre, taking the part of Orestes in two parts of the sensational production of the Oresteia of Aeschylus. This was followed by Lord Belvoir in The Man Who Ate the Popomack by W. J. Turner, and Saint Anthony in Maeterlinck's The Miracle of Saint Anthony. In 1927, Evans played a poet in The Pleasure Garden by Beatrice Mayor followed by Young Man in On Baile's Strand by W. B. Yeats, Midir in The Immortal Hour by Fiona Macleod, the Hon. Algernon Moodie in The Rumour by C.K. Munro, Mark Ingestire in Sweeney Todd by Dibdin Pitt, the poet in The Lost Silk Hat by Lord Dunsany, the Captain in Androcles and the Lion by George Bernard Shaw, Mister Four and Young Man in The Adding Machine by Elmer Rice, Don Juan in the play of the same title by James Elroy Flecker, two parts in Terence Gray's own play The Red Nights of the Tcheka, the Stage Manager in The Player Queen (also by Yeats), the Second Engineer in The Insect Play by the Čapek brothers, Prince Kamose in another Gray play called And in the Tomb, and finally in June 1927, Don Pelegari in Pirandello's Each In His Own Way. Both Yeats and Shaw attended performances of their own plays. In 1927, he was one of a group of out-of-work actors including Laurence Olivier, chosen to perform in a ""tryout"" of R. C. Sherriff's Journey's End directed by James Whale at the Apollo Theatre in London, and later in 1929 at the Savoy Theatre which had been leased by the Chicago theatre manager Maurice Browne. It was a huge success, running for two years and making Maurice's name. He played the young officer Raleigh, who dies at the end of the play. In 1934, he went to the Old Vic Theatre where his interpretation of Shakespeare's Richard II was highly praised. It was as a result of this that he was invited to join Katharine Cornell in the United States. His first appearance on Broadway was in Romeo and Juliet opposite Cornell in 1936, but he made his biggest impact in Richard II, a production whose unexpected success was the surprise of the 1937 theatre season and allowed Evans to play Hamlet (1938) (the first time that the play was performed uncut on the New York stage), Falstaff in Henry IV, Part 1 (1939), Macbeth (1941) and Malvolio in Twelfth Night (1942) opposite the Viola of Helen Hayes, under the direction of Margaret Webster. He also starred opposite Cornell in the 1935 production of George Bernard Shaw's St. Joan. When the U.S. entered the Second World War, he enlisted in the United States Army and he later was in charge of an Army Entertainment Section in the Central Pacific. He arranged for the transfer of Carl Reiner from the Signal Corps to the entertainment unit in Hawaii, where Evans was his commanding officer. The unit produced dozens of shows for the troops in the Pacific. Reiner later hired Evans for the part of Hobart the butler in The Jerk, as Evans's agent had indicated that the part would enable Evans to maintain his union benefits. Evans produced his famous ""G.I. version"" of Hamlet that cut the text of the play to make the title character more appealing to the troops, an interpretation so popular that he later took it to Broadway in 1945. Evans rose to the rank of Major by the end of the war. He shifted his attention to the works of Shaw, notably as John Tanner in Man and Superman and as King Magnus in The Apple Cart. In 1952, he starred as the murderous husband in the original Broadway stage production of Dial M for Murder. He also successfully produced Broadway productions in which he did not appear, notably The Teahouse of the August Moon. In 1956, Evans recorded an LP of stories from Winnie-the-Pooh. American television audiences of the 1960s will remember Evans as Samantha's father, Maurice, on the sitcom Bewitched. His real-life insistence that his first name be pronounced ""Morris"" was ironically at odds with his Bewitched character's contrasting stance that it be pronounced ""Maw-REESE"". Evans also appeared in the fourth season of Daniel Boone starring Fess Parker playing a French impresario ""Beaumarchais"". He also played The Puzzler on Batman in a double episode storyline (which was common for that series) in December 1966. Continuing his American TV appearances, he guest starred in The Big Valley from the latter part of the fourth and final season of that western series in April 1969, an episode entitled ""Danger Road"". Evans had great impact on the big screen as well. He played a diabolical villain in Kind Lady (1951; co-starring Ethel Barrymore, Keenan Wynn, and Angela Lansbury); Emperor Antoninus in Androcles and the Lion (1952); and Sir Arthur Sullivan in The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan (1953). Evans appeared memorably in two 1968 films: as the evolved orangutan, Dr. Zaius in Planet of the Apes (and the 1970 sequel Beneath the Planet of the Apes) and as the doomed ""Hutch"" in the thriller Rosemary's Baby, who attempts to warn the title character of the true nature of her Satanic neighbours. Evans appeared in more American television productions of Shakespeare than any other actor. Beginning in 1953, for the famous television anthology, Hallmark Hall of Fame, he starred in the first feature-length (i.e., longer than an hour) dramatisations of the plays to be presented on American television. They were: In bringing so much Shakespeare to American television in such a short span of time (between 1953 and 1960), Evans was a true pioneer. This had never been tried before – at least, not in the U.S. He firmly believed that it was an actor's job to ""lead public taste, not to play to public taste"". Evans brought his Shakespeare productions to Broadway many times, playing Hamlet on the Great White Way in four separate productions for a record grand total of 283 performances. He and Dame Judith Anderson starred on Broadway several times in Macbeth. Their performances were widely regarded as the definitive portrayals of these characters, although one notable dissenter was Orson Welles, who stated that Evans, as an actor, was ""worse than bad – he was poor."" Evans appeared on Broadway as Hamlet four times, but the productions of the play that he appeared in were consecutive revivals of it – no other actor played Hamlet on Broadway between 1938, when Evans first played him there, and 1946, which marked Evans's last Broadway Hamlet. He is very likely the only actor to have accomplished this so far. Although he had taken U.S. citizenship in 1941, Evans had returned to Britain by the end of the 1960s. Aside from an infrequent trip to the United States and occasional visits to retired actors in financial need (as a representative of the Actors' Fund, of which he was a longtime trustee), he lived quietly near Brighton. He never married, and was survived by a brother, Hugh, of London. Evans died, aged 87, in Rottingdean, East Sussex, England, reportedly of heart failure as a result of a bronchial infection.",Normal

"The Copenhagen Convention, which came into force on 14 March 1857, is a maritime treaty governing transit passage through the Danish straits. It has abolished the Sound Dues and all Danish straits have been made international waterways free to all commercial shipping. Its provisions were later reaffirmed by Article 282 of the Treaty of Versailles, becoming binding for its parties. Although the Convention does not cover warships, military vessels have also been free to traverse the straits, regulated by the general international rule of innocent passage through international straits and the Royal Ordinance of 1976. It had been increasingly evident that the Sound Dues had a negative impact on the port and merchants of Copenhagen, although the dues delivered by then one eighth of the Danish state income; and the world's seafaring nations were becoming less and less tolerant of these tolls and restrictions. In compensation for the abolition, the Danish state received a one-time fee of 33.5 million Danish rigsdalers, paid to Denmark by the other European shipping nations who signed the convention. Of the total fee, Great Britain paid approximately one third, and Russia another third. A similar convention between Denmark and the United States, signed in Washington the same year, gave American ships free passage in perpetuity for a one-time fee of $393,000.",Normal

"The Ninian Central Platform is an oil platform in the North Sea. When constructed in Loch Kishorn, Scotland in 1978 the 600,000tonne platform was the world's largest man-made movable object before being towed to its current position and sunk to the sea floor. It is a circular concrete gravity structure, 140m in diameter at its base, with seven concentric walls of stepped heights intersected by radial walls at 45-degree angles. A 14m wide central shaft is surrounded by a breakwater wall (""Jarlan Wall"") 45m in diameter and 1.6m thick pierced with 1.5m diameter holes. Between these two walls drill slots are arranged for drilling up to 42wells. The Ninian field lies in United Kingdom Continental Shelf (UKCS) Blocks 32, 33, 37 and 38. The reservoir is contained in the marine-deltaic sandstones of the Middle Jurassic Brent Group. There were estimated to be 2,920million barrels (464million cubic metres) of oil in place of which 35 to 40 percent was thought to be recoverable. Ninian oil is a paraffinic-naphthenic type with an API gravity of 36°. The fabrication details of the three platforms are shown in the table. Ninian Central operates in conjunction with the Ninian Southern and Ninian Northern platforms. First oil was produced from the field in December 1978. Production reached a peak of 315,000 barrels (50,100m3) of oil per day in the summer of 1982. At the end of 1988 over 811millionbbl (129millionm3) had been produced. Originally operated by Chevron Petroleum (UK), a division of Chevron, the field was acquired and operated by Oryx UK Energy Co. in late 1996 and then by Kerr-McGee from 2000. CNR International assumed ownership and operated the Ninian Field from 2002. As originally designed the Ninian Central oil processing facilities comprised two parallel Freewater Knock-out Vessels, crude oil coolers, crude oil booster pumps, a metering skid and Main Oil Line (MOL) pumps. After the MOL pumps the fluids were co-mingled with oil from the Brent separators, and the Strathspey, Ninian Northern, Heather and Magnus platforms. Vapour from the Freewater Knock-out Vessels was cooled and then compressed in a gas compressor then used as fuel gas or sent to flare. Oil from the Brent system was routed to the Brent HP separator and separated oil flowed to the Brent LP Separator. From there oil was sent to the booster and export pumps. Gas from the Brent separators flowed to the Ninian gas compression. Gas from the Statfjord pipeline flowed to the Statfjord Slug Catcher then to the Statfjord Gas Cooler. Gas from the Brent and Statfjord systems was compressed, dehydrated by counter-current contact with glycol. After cooling gas was compressed for export and recovered natural gas liquids (NGL) sent to the oil export line. Ninian Central acted as an oil reception and export hub for a number of installations in the Northern North Sea. Ninian Central receives, or received, oil and gas from the following installations: Oil from the field is exported through the 36"" Ninian pipeline to Sullom Voe (175km). The Ninian Southern installation is steel jacket platform located 3 miles south of Ninian Central. As originally conceived the process plant comprised the following oil and gas facilities. Well fluids were routed to one of two parallel horizontal Free Water Knock Out Vessels, operating at about 6.5 bar and 90°C, where 3-phase (oilgaswater) separation took place. Oil from the vessels was cooled and flowed to the Crude Oil Booster Pumps, then through a metering package and to the Main Oil Line Pumps and onward by 24” pipeline to Ninian Central. Produced water from the Free Water Knock Out Vessels was treated to remove oil prior to overboard disposal. Vapour from the vessels was cooled in Gas Coolers and was then compressed in the First Stage Compressor and cooled again. Some of this gas was used in the fuel gas system. The main gas flow was compressed in the Second Stage Compressor and then dehydrated through counter-current contact with glycol in the Glycol Absorber. The dry gas was cooled and chilled in a refrigeration Chiller. Condensed liquids were routed to the LPG metering system and export with the oil stream and dry gas was routed to the fuel gas system and any excess to by 8” pipeline to Ninian Central. Fluids from the subsea Lyell field were routed to the Lyell Slugcatcher and thence to the Lyell Separator. From here oil was pumped to the metering package and co-mingled with the Ninian Southern export oil stream to Ninian Central. Vapour from the Lyell Separator was compressed and mixed with the Ninian Southern gas prior to further compression and dehydration. The Ninian Northern installation was a steel jacket platform located 3.2 miles north-west of Ninian Central in a water depth of 141 metres. The platform was installed in June 1978 and was designed to operate as a satellite flowing well fluids directly to Ninian Central although it was equipped to partial process the well fluids. Production from Ninian Northern started in August 1980, and reached a peak of 89,587 Barrels of Oil per Day in June 1981. As originally conceived the process facilities comprised the following processes. Well fluids were routed to one of the separators either the High Pressure Separator or the Low Pressure Separator. Each acted as a 3-phase (oilgaswater) separator. Oil from the separators was co-mingled and sent directly to Ninian Central via a 24” pipeline. As wellhead pressures declined a multi-phase pump was installed to provide sufficient pressure to export the oil to Ninian Central. Vapour from the Separators was used as fuel gas excess gas was routed to Ninian Central through a 10” gas pipeline. Produced water from the Separators was treated in hydrocyclones to remove oil prior to overboard disposal. Ninian Northern formerly had a water injection system to water-flood the reservoir; this was subsequently decommissioned. A Cessation of Production notice was approved by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) in November 2016. Production permanently ceased on Ninian Northern on 18 May 2017. Removal of the topsides was completed in 2021 and removal of the jacket in 2022. 60°53′N 1°26′E﻿ ﻿60.883°N 1.433°E﻿ 60.883; 1.433",Normal
"The WhatsOnStage Awards, founded in 2001 as the Theatregoers' Choice Awards, are a fan-driven set of awards organised by the theatre website WhatsOnStage.com, based on a popular vote recognising performers and productions of English theatre, with an emphasis on London's West End theatre. The 2022 Whatsonstage Awards, the 22nd, took place on Sunday 27 February at the Prince of Wales Theatre. It was hosted for the third ceremony in a row by theatre star Jodie Prenger and Tom Read Wilson. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting shut-down of UK theatres due to lockdowns, the 2021 edition of the show was cancelled and was replaced by an online event which celebrated twenty one members of the public who had supported the theatre industry during the pandemic, rather than the usual awarding of theatre productions themselves. The 2022 ceremony returns to awarding creative talent involved in West End theatre and is fully voted for by the British theatergoing public, who voted for their winners on WhatsOnStage.com. The stage adaptation of Disney's blockbuster film Frozen received the most nominations with thirteen, equaling the record set by & Juliet at the 2020 ceremony, while The Tragedy of Macbeth was the most nominated play, with five nods. Due to the large volume of eligible productions, the number of nominations in each category was raised from five to six for the first time. The performance categories were changed to be gender-neutral in an effort to be more inclusive. The nominees for the 22nd WhatsOnStage Awards were announced on 9 December 2021 by James Graham and Gabrielle Brooks in a livestream from The Other Palace.",Normal
"Clarence E. Wheeler (September 27, 1885 – December 28, 1966) was an American musician and composer. He created the music for many of Woody Woodpecker series cartoons under Walter Lantz Productions along with films in the 1950s. Wheeler was born in Walnut, Kansas. He formed an orchestra that appeared on the radio in Chicago in the 1930s, playing on The Terminix All-Star Program in May 1933 on WBBM. He was music director of the station from 1935 to 1938 and was replaced by Caesar Petrillo, brother of future American Federation of Musicians boss James Petrillo. He arrived in Hollywood that year and began writing music published by Alberto Colombo. Among his compositions were Cinemaland Parade, Silhouette in Rhythm, Sing For Our Fallen Brave., There Must Be a Way, Hey There, Mr. Labor, That Night in Donegal, Tiny Little Big Shot, Hello Broadway, London Calling, the last four with James J. May. He soon went into scoring short films. His first credit was in the 1941 Columbia Pictures release The Carpenters, directed by former Warner Bros. animator Paul Fennell, where radio commentator Raymond Gram Swing reviewed the history of the invasion of Poland. He was hired in 1944 by George Pal to provide the scores for his Puppetoons and live-action shorts such as This is Oil (1949), released by Paramount Pictures. Wheeler also worked on features, providing orchestrations for Shirley Temple's teen star vehicle, Miss Annie Rooney (1942), the all-star extravaganza Tales of Manhattan (1942), and a number of the Blondie movies released by Columbia in the 1940s. Wheeler also scored for early television programs, being hired by Jerry Fairbanks to write music for the series Public Prosecutor in 1948. That same year Wheeler also created the original opening and closing theme for the animated series Crusader Rabbit, adapting and arranging the folk melodies The Trail to Mexico (known on cue sheets as ""Rabbit Fanfare"") and Ten Little Indians (known as ""Main Title Rabbit""). Some of Wheeler's film music was recompiled as stock music and leased to television producers, for airing on programs such as Topper, The Untouchables, Wyatt Earp and Gumby. His first animated cartoon score was The 3 Minnies: Sota, Tonka and Ha-Ha! (1949), distributed by Republic Pictures. When Walter Lantz re-opened his studio in 1950 he hired Wheeler to score all his cartoons, almost 140 in total, beginning with Puny Express through The Nautical Nut, which was released in 1967 after Wheeler's death.",Normal

"A Kendrick extrication device (KED) is a device used in extrication of victims of traffic collisions from motor vehicles. Commonly carried on ambulances, a KED is typically used by an emergency medical technician, paramedic, or another first responder. It was originally designed for extrication of race car drivers. Typically used in conjunction with a cervical collar, a KED is a semi-rigid brace that secures the head, neck and torso in an anatomically neutral position. Its use is claimed to reduce the possibility of additional injuries to these regions during extrication, although its value has been questioned, as there is a lack of evidence to support its use. The original KED was designed by Richard Kendrick in 1978. Typically there are two head straps, three torso straps, and two legs straps which are used to adequately secure the KED to the victim. Unlike a long spine board or litter, the KED uses a series of wooden or polymer bars in a nylon jacket, allowing the responders to immobilize the neck and upper spine and remove the victim from the vehicle or other confined space. Although a KED can also be used to immobilize infants and children, it is preferable to use specifically designed pediatric immobilization devices whenever possible. If a KED is used to immobilize an infant or child, appropriate padding must be used to ensure complete immobilization in a manner that does not obscure the thorax and abdomen, thereby preventing continued assessment of these vital areas. The device can be quickly and easily inserted into the seat of a vehicle by a single rescuer, allows access to the airway and conforms to any body size. A KED is typically used only on hemodynamically stable victims; unstable victims are extricated using rapid extrication techniques without the prior application of the KED. Once the KED is slid into position, it is secured to the victim with straps in order to prevent movement. The first strap that is secured is the middle torso strap. According to the KED users' manual securing this strap secures the greatest area of the device and therefore provides the greatest stability while securing the rest of the device. Next the bottom torso strap is secured, however the top torso strap is not secured until just prior to moving the patient to the long spine board. This is to allow the patient to breathe easily while the rest of the device is secured. Following the bottom torso strap the leg straps are secured. These may be applied in a ""criss-cross"" fashion (according to the KED users' manual this is the most commonly used method), or applied by securing them to their respective sides. If there is any evidence of a groin injury the ""criss-cross"" method cannot be used. Following application of the leg straps the void between the head and device is padded as needed and the head is secured. Finally, just prior to moving the patient to a long spine board the top strap is secured. Some schools teach this order by remembering the phrase ""My Baby Looks Hot Tonight"" or ""Maori Boys Love Hairy Teke"", where the beginning of each word stands for Middle torso strap, Bottom torso strap, Leg straps, Head strap and Top torso strap. The head pad can bring the head too far forward for the side panels to fully immobilize it. Care must be taken to secure the head properly to maintain neutral immobilization. If the head is too far forward, the head is brought back to meet the KED unless crepitus, pain or resistance is met. If these symptoms are present, the head is immobilized in the position found. There has been debate surrounding the exact order of applying the torso straps, with some saying that the order does not matter as long as the torso is secured before the head. The KED users' manual is sometimes used in these debates: it states the reason the top strap is last is a function of breathing and not the process of immobilization itself. There is controversy about whether the use of a KED is actually appropriate in prehospital care. A 2015 article in the Journal of Paramedic Practice said that although the device has been used since the 1970s, its ""overall appropriateness in patient care should be viewed with caution"" and there is a ""lack of evidence to support its use"". A 1988 article in the Canadian Medical Association Journal said the device had ""yet to be evaluated for its immobilization of the cervical spine"" and that ""the role and performance of the device in transferring patients by road or air ... must be addressed"". During rapid extrication, the patient is not immobilized by a KED, but rather taken directly out of the car onto a back board. Reasons for using this technique include:",Normal

"The New Red Sandstone, chiefly in British geology, is composed of beds of red sandstone and associated rocks laid down throughout the Permian (300 million years ago) to the end of the Triassic (about 200million years ago), that underlie the Jurassic-Triassic age Penarth Group. The name distinguishes it from the Old Red Sandstone which is largely Devonian in age, and with which it was originally confused due to their similar composition. Its upper layers consist of mudstones, but most of the formation consists of reddish to yellowish sandstones, interbedded with rare evaporite minerals such as halite and gypsum. These indicate deposition within a hot and arid palaeo-environment, such as a desert or sabkha. The New Red Sandstone was originally identified in Scotland, at quarries in Elgin. It covers large parts of the Moray Firth Basin. In this area it overlies the Old Red Sandstone unconformably (missing the intervening rocks), and both sandstones were used extensively in architecture in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. It also covers much of central England, where it generally forms a low-lying plain except for the Mid Severn Sandstone Plateau. Thick layers (up to 1,100 metres (3,600ft) thick) are present in the faulted Cheshire Basin which also extends beneath north Shropshire. There are numerous escarpments forming small prominent hills within this area. The sandstone also underlies parts of Lancashire and Cumbria, and east of the Pennines it extends through Nottinghamshire and central Yorkshire. Smaller outcrops occur in other parts of Britain such as the Red Cliffs of Dawlish and East Devon. In terms of its lithology, the New Red Sandstone comprises true sandstones, mudrocks and evaporite strata. The sandstone units are monomineralic, consisting only of quartz grains (negligible amounts of other minerals may be present), and they are cemented together with the ferric iron oxide haematite (Fe2O3). The presence of this particular iron oxide is evidence for a terrestrial environment of deposition such as a desert, and gives the rocks the red colour which they are named after. The common effect of rusting produces exactly the same deposit, but as a result of a different process. The sandstone units generally lack fossils (as do most terrestrial rocks). The grains in the member have a high degree of sphericity, are very well sorted and typically have a small size range (0.5 to 2 millimetres (0.020 to 0.079in)). The NRS is a texturally mature rock. Certain units of the New Red Sandstone (e.g. Hopeman Sandstone Formation and Helsby Sandstone Formation) feature commonly as building stone due to their abundance and mechanical strength. The New Red Sandstone has yielded many fossils, including the world-famous Elgin Reptiles. These are late Permian to Late Triassic in age, and include mammal-like reptiles and some of the earliest predecessors of dinosaurs. An earliest Permian (Asselian) fauna is known from the Kenilworth Sandstone Formation of the English Midlands, including primitive synapsids and temnospondyl amphibians. Many ancient buildings of Devon Red Sandstone can be found in Exeter the ancient capital of Devon, notably the castle, Roman medieval city walls, several churches and many buildings of the Cathedral Close. The local quarry was at Heavitree by which name the local sandstone – actually a type of breccia – is generally known.",Normal

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily. It, unlike other bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP's) inhibits the ability of other BMP's to induce bone and cartilage development. It is a disulfide-linked homodimer. It negatively regulates bone density. BMP3 is an antagonist to other BMP's in the differentiation of osteogenic progenitors. It is highly expressed in fractured tissues. BMP3 is hypermethylated in many cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) and hence along with other hypermethylated genes, may be used as a biomarker to detect early stage CRC.

"The Nordkapp class is a Norwegian Coast Guard ship class built in the 1980s, and used for rescue, fishery inspection, research purposes and general EEZ patrol in Norwegian waters until the early 2020s. It is a class of ships purpose-built for the Norwegian Coast Guard with a secondary role as wartime naval escorts. The Norwegian Coast Guard is a part of the Royal Norwegian Navy, and has some police authority. In June 2018 it was announced that the Vard Group, a subsidiary of Fincantieri, would build three replacement vessels for NOK 5 billion; delivery of the three new vessels started in 2023 with the final vessel envisaged in 2024. As of November 2023, only Nordkapp remains operational, having been transferred to the Navy to fulfill a mine warfare command role. The other vessels have been decommissioned. The Nordkapp class carried one helicopter at launch, the Westland Lynx, but was decommissioned in 2014. The ships are capable of ice browsing. Due to the fact that these vessels may serve as wartime naval escorts they have provisions to carry additional weapons and sensors, such as anti-ship missiles and torpedoes. The Nordkapp-class is named after North Cape, in Norwegian: Nordkapp, which is also the name of one of the vessels of the class. A fisheries protection vessel named Nordkapp served the Royal Norwegian Navy from 1937 to 1954, including distinguished World War II service. NoCGV Andenes patrolled the Persian Gulf during the Gulf War in 1991 as part of the Coalition forces. In 1994, the ship was involved in an altercation with the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society's ship Whales Forever, leading to a collision and damage to both ships. The Nordkapp-class vessels are to be replaced from 2022 by the new, and larger, Jan-Mayen class patrol vessels currently under construction. NoCGV Senja was decommissioned in November 2021 followed by Andenes in October 2023. NoCGV Nordkapp was transferred to the Navy's mine warfare branch in November 2022, and changed her prefix to HNoMS.

"""God of the gaps"" is a theological concept that emerged in the 19th century and revolves around the idea that gaps in scientific understanding are regarded as indications of the existence of God. This perspective has its origins in the observation that some individuals, often with religious inclinations, point to areas where science falls short in explaining natural phenomena as opportunities to insert the presence of a divine creator. The term itself was coined in response to this tendency. This theological view suggests that God fills in the gaps left by scientific knowledge, and that these gaps represent moments of divine intervention or influence. However, this concept has been met with criticism and debate from various quarters. Detractors argue that this perspective is problematic as it seems to rely on gaps in human understanding and ignorance to make its case for the existence of God. As scientific knowledge continues to advance, these gaps tend to shrink, potentially weakening the argument for God's existence. Critics contend that such an approach can undermine religious beliefs by suggesting that God only operates in the unexplained areas of our understanding, leaving little room for divine involvement in a comprehensive and coherent worldview. Moreover, the ""God of the gaps"" perspective has been criticized for its association with logical fallacies, specifically the argument from ignorance fallacy. This fallacy asserts that just because something is not currently explained by science, it must be attributed to a supernatural cause. This type of reasoning is seen as inherently flawed and does not provide a robust foundation for religious faith. In this context, some theologians and scientists have proposed that a more satisfactory approach is to view evidence of God's actions within the natural processes themselves, rather than relying on the gaps in scientific understanding to validate religious beliefs. From the 1880s, Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Part Two, ""On Priests"", said ""... into every gap they put their delusion, their stopgap, which they called God"". The concept, although not the exact wording, goes back to Henry Drummond, a 19th-century evangelist lecturer, from his 1893 Lowell Lectures on The Ascent of Man. He chastises those Christians who point to the things that Science has not explained as presence of God — ""gaps which they will fill up with God"" — and urges them to embrace all nature as God's, as the work of ""an immanent God, which is the God of Evolution, is infinitely grander than the occasional wonder-worker, who is the God of an old theology."" In 1933, Ernest Barnes, the Bishop of Birmingham, used the phrase in a discussion of general relativity's implication of a Big Bang: Must we then postulate Divine intervention? Are we to bring in God to create the first current of Laplace's nebula or to let off the cosmic firework of Lemaître's imagination? I confess an unwillingness to bring God in this way upon the scene. The circumstances with thus seem to demand his presence are too remote and too obscure to afford me any true satisfaction. Men have thought to find God at the special creation of their own species, or active when mind or life first appeared on earth. They have made him God of the gaps in human knowledge. To me the God of the trigger is as little satisfying as the God of the gaps. It is because throughout the physical Universe I find thought and plan and power that behind it I see God as the creator. During World War II the German theologian and martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer expressed the concept in similar terms in letters he wrote while in a Nazi prison. Bonhoeffer wrote, for example: how wrong it is to use God as a stop-gap for the incompleteness of our knowledge. If in fact the frontiers of knowledge are being pushed further and further back (and that is bound to be the case), then God is being pushed back with them, and is therefore continually in retreat. We are to find God in what we know, not in what we don't know. In his 1955 book Science and Christian Belief Charles Alfred Coulson (1910−1974) wrote: There is no 'God of the gaps' to take over at those strategic places where science fails; and the reason is that gaps of this sort have the unpreventable habit of shrinking. and Either God is in the whole of Nature, with no gaps, or He's not there at all. Coulson was a mathematics professor at Oxford University as well as a Methodist church leader, often appearing in the religious programs of British Broadcasting Corporation. His book got national attention, was reissued as a paperback, and was reprinted several times, most recently in 1971. It is claimed that the actual phrase 'God of the gaps' was invented by Coulson. The term was then used in a 1971 book and a 1978 article, by Richard Bube. He articulated the concept in greater detail in Man come of Age: Bonhoeffer’s Response to the God-of-the-Gaps (1978). Bube attributed modern crises in religious faith in part to the inexorable shrinking of the God-of-the-gaps as scientific knowledge progressed. As humans progressively increased their understanding of nature, the previous ""realm"" of God seemed to many persons and religions to be getting smaller and smaller by comparison. Bube maintained that Darwin's Origin of Species was the ""death knell"" of the God-of-the-gaps. Bube also maintained that the God-of-the-gaps was not the same as the God of the Bible (that is, he was not making an argument against God per se, but rather asserting there was a fundamental problem with the perception of God as existing in the gaps of present-day knowledge). The term ""God of the gaps"" is sometimes used in describing the incremental retreat of religious explanations of physical phenomena in the face of increasingly comprehensive scientific explanations for those phenomena. Dorothy Dinnerstein includes psychological explanations for developmental distortions leading to a person believing in a deity, particularly a male deity. R. Laird Harris writes of the physical science aspect of this: The expression, ""God of the Gaps,"" contains a real truth. It is erroneous if it is taken to mean that God is not immanent in natural law but is only to be observed in mysteries unexplained by law. No significant Christian group has believed this view. It is true, however, if it be taken to emphasize that God is not only immanent in natural law but also is active in the numerous phenomena associated with the supernatural and the spiritual. There are gaps in a physical-chemical explanation of this world, and there always will be. Because science has learned many marvelous secrets of nature, it cannot be concluded that it can explain all phenomena. Meaning, soul, spirits, and life are subjects incapable of physical-chemical explanation or formation. The term God-of-the-gaps fallacy can refer to a position that assumes an act of God as the explanation for an unknown phenomenon, which according to the users of the term, is a variant of an argument from ignorance fallacy. Such an argument is sometimes reduced to the following form: One example of such an argument, which uses God as an explanation of one of the current gaps in biological science, is as follows: ""Because current science can't figure out exactly how life started, it must be God who caused life to start."" Critics of intelligent design creationism, for example, have accused proponents of using this basic type of argument. God-of-the-gaps arguments have been discouraged by some theologians who assert that such arguments tend to relegate God to the leftovers of science: as scientific knowledge increases, the dominion of God decreases. The term was invented as a criticism of people who perceive that God only acts in the gaps, and who restrict God's activity to such ""gaps"". It has also been argued that the God-of-the-gaps view is predicated on the assumption that any event which can be explained by science automatically excludes God; that if God did not do something via direct action, that he had no role in it at all. The ""God of the gaps"" argument, as traditionally advanced by scholarly Christians, was intended as a criticism against weak or tenuous faith, not as a statement against theism or belief in God. According to John Habgood in The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology, the phrase is generally derogatory, and is inherently a direct criticism of a tendency to postulate acts of God to explain phenomena for which science has not (at least at present) given a satisfactory account. Habgood also states: It is theologically more satisfactory to look for evidence of God's actions within natural processes rather than apart from them, in much the same way that the meaning of a book transcends, but is not independent of, the paper and ink of which it is comprised. It has been criticized by both theologians and scientists, who say that it is a logical fallacy to base belief in God on gaps in scientific knowledge. In this vein, Richard Dawkins, an atheist, dedicates a chapter of his book The God Delusion to criticism of the God-of-the-gaps argument. He noted that: Creationists eagerly seek a gap in present-day knowledge or understanding. If an apparent gap is found, it is assumed that God, by default, must fill it. What worries thoughtful theologians such as Bonhoeffer is that gaps shrink as science advances, and God is threatened with eventually having nothing to do and nowhere to hide.",Normal

"Edward Richard Fulton Sheehan (c. 1930 – November 3, 2008) was an American author and foreign correspondent who reported from the Middle East, Africa and Central America as a freelance journalist in the pages of newspapers, magazines and the many books he authored. Growing up in Newton, Massachusetts, Sheehan attended the local parish school where he was the regular altar boy for the parish pastor, Bishop Richard Cushing, who was later elevated to become Archbishop of Boston and cardinal. Sheehan remained a conservative Roman Catholic throughout his life. He attended Boston College High School and moved on to Boston College, where he participated on the school's newspaper and graduated in 1952. He served in the United States Navy after graduating from college. Sheehan was hired by The Boston Globe and was sent overseas to cover stories in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. His work also includes Latin America; Agony in the Garden and Innocent Darkness, both very successful novels. Mr. Sheehan found his daughter in El Salvador. He started work for the United States Department of State in 1957, serving in the American embassies in Egypt in 1957 to 1958 and in Lebanon from 1959 to 1961. These experiences were the seeds of his 1964 debut novel, Kingdom of Illusion, published by Random House, which tells the intrigues swirling around Mohammed VII, playboy king of the Middle Eastern country of Al Khadra. Most of Sheehan's reporting career was as a freelance journalist, whose articles appeared in a variety of publications, including Harper's Magazine, The New York Review of Books and The New York Times. His contributions to The New York Times Magazine in the 1960s and 1970s, included stories about travels on the Congo River, the ascendancy of Milton Obote as President of Uganda, the Black September hijackings and detonation of U.S. aircraft, the accession of Anwar Sadat in Egypt and Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi and its oil wealth. Sheehan was known for coverage of the Arab–Israeli conflict. Using his well placed sources, Sheehan was able to quote in a 1976 article of Foreign Policy conversations that took place in 1974 between Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger and Mid-East leaders in which Nixon indicated his support for the return of all lands conquered by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. These excerpts were later expanded into his 1976 book The Arabs, Israelis and Kissinger. The State Department denied the claims and a hunt was made for the source of the leaks. Further details from these reliable Nixon Administration sources were included in The Arabs, Israelis and Kissinger about Kissinger's role as a shuttle diplomat trying to resolve the conflict between Syrian leader Hafez Assad, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israel's Prime Minister Golda Meir. Alfred Atherton, a career foreign service officer, had taken detailed notes during the shuttle negotiations and was Sheehan's source. Atherton was given what Time magazine described as a ""serious reprimand"" for his actions, though Kissinger himself appears to have authorized Atherton to share the information with Sheehan. His 1989 book Agony in the Garden documented his travels to the war zones and trouble spots in Central America, including his travels with the Contras in Nicaragua. Sheehan died in Newton at age 78 on November 3, 2008, of an allergic reaction to medication.",Normal
"Alessandro Bonsanti (November 25, 1904 in Florence – February 17, 1984 in Florence) was a writer and Italian politician. Alessandro Bonsanti, writer, was born in Florence. Very young, after completing his studies, he moved to work in Milan, where he worked for three years as an employee at a local bank, collaborating in the magazine La Fiera Literaria, where he published his first Brigants story in Maremma. Returning to Florence, he came into contact with the literary environment that animated Solaria (the European magazine, which existed from 1926 to 1936), who was a collaborator and director, publishing military narrative (1927) The loving servant (1929) and the whims of 'Adriana (1934), republished in distant Racconti 1962, texts of the past that have to do with a distant social history. In 1937 Bonsanti founded and assumed the direction of publishing at a magazine that collected the inheritance of Solaria. In 1941 he took over as la direzione del Gabinetto scientifìco-letterario Vieusseux (Director of the Vieusseux Scientific-Literature Cabinet), left vacant by Eugenio Montale. This was a prestigious assignment that Bonsanti held with great willingness and firmness, making for almost forty years an untiring promoter of various cultural initiatives. During the war, he published two books: Dialoghi e altre prose (Dialogues and Other Prose) (1940) and Introduzione al gran viaggio (Introduction to the Great Trip) (1944). The following year he assumed the position of Director of Il Mondo, which he himself founded with Eugenio Montale and Arturo Loria. Other books to remember are: La vipera e il toro (1955) and cavalli di bronzo (1956). In recent years Bonsanti's interests were also addressed to active politics; in this period he was approaching the Republican Party of Spadolini and in 1983 was elected mayor of Florence, head of a pentapartito junta, which was not completed due to his death in 1984. His daughter Sandra, a journalist, was a member of the Republic. Alessandro Bonsanti is buried in the Cimitero delle Porte Sante in Florence. He was nominated for the Strega Prize.",Normal

"A side job, also informally called a side hustle or side gig, is an additional job that a person takes in addition to their primary job in order to supplement their income. Side jobs may be done out of necessity, when one's income from their main job is insufficient to support them, or simply out of a desire to earn more income. Working a side job can also, informally, be called moonlighting, usually when it is performed after normal working time. A side job can be a full-time job, part-time contract, or freelance work, and a person can hold more than one side job. Side jobs gained in popularity in the U.S. due to wage stagnation and low wage growth that has not kept up with the rise in cost of living, with nearly a third of people with side jobs requiring them to pay expenses. Nearly 39% of all Americans report having a side job, including 43% of full-time workers. The most common reason workers take on side jobs is to obtain additional disposable income. In the United Kingdom, 60 percent of students and graduates reported having a side job, and 43 percent required it to pay renting expenses. Millennials are the most likely to have a side job, usually to have a financial ""safety net"", leading to them being considered the ""side hustle generation"". However, they are also common as a means to pay off student loans, as well as to leverage one's creativity in ways that would normally not be feasible in the typical workplace. When a person's primary job only provides income so that they may pursue their preferred side job, it is typically known as a ""day job"". The many examples of side hustles include things that can be done at full-time, part-time or freelance at the same time as having a day job, some can include; copywriting, Amazon FBA, buy-low and sell-high through ecommerce, affiliate marketing, swing trading, social media marketing agency, day trading, investment in stocks, dropshipping, trade cryptocurrency, decentralized finance, option trading, NFTs, tutoring or coaching, and business management.

"Oligochaetochilus macrosceles D.L.Jones & C.J.French Pterostylis macrosceles, commonly known as the slender rufous greenhood is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. Both flowering and non-flowering plants have a relatively large rosette of leaves. Flowering plants also have between four and eight white flowers with green brown lines and small, insect-like labellum. It is distinguished from other Western Australian greenhoods by the unusually long thread-like tips on its sepals. Pterostylis macrosceles is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a leaf rosette which is 40–80mm (2–3in) wide. Flowering plants have a rosette at the base of the flowering stem but the leaves are usually withered by flowering time. Between four and eight or more translucent white flowers with green or brown lines are borne on a flowering stem 100–350mm (4–10in) tall. The flowers lean forward and are 30–50mm (1–2in) long and 10–12mm (0.4–0.5in) wide. The dorsal sepal and petals form a hood or ""galea"" over the column with the dorsal sepal having a long, narrow tip on its end. The lateral sepals turn downwards and suddenly narrow to thin, unusually long thread-like tips. The labellum is fleshy, dark brown, hairy and insect-like. Flowering occurs from September to October. This greenhood was first formally described in 2014 by David Jones and Christopher French and given the name Oligochaetochilus macrosceles from a specimen collected near Yellowdine and the description was published in Australian Orchid Review. The genus Oligochaetochilus is not accepted as distinct from Pterostylis by most taxonomists and in 2015 David Jones changed the name to Pterostylis macrosceles ""to allow for the different taxonomic views held at generic level"". The specific epithet (macrosceles) is derived from the Ancient Greek words makros meaning ""long"": 494 and skelos meaning ""leg"": 469 referring to the long tips on the sepals. The slender rufous greenhood is usually found growing in shallow soil on granite outcrops between Goomalling and Queen Victoria Rocks south of Coolgardie in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Mallee and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. Pterostylis macrosceles is classified as ""not threatened"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.",Normal

"The Lola T332 was a race car designed and built by Lola Cars for use in Formula 5000 racing and made its racing debut in 1973. The T332 was successful around the globe with race victories in places such as Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the United States. The Lola commonly used the 5.0-litre Chevrolet V8 engine, though some competitors in Australia and New Zealand used the slightly cheaper and less powerful Australian made 5.0-litre Repco Holden V8. The alloysteel tub of the T332 followed standard Lola design practice with twin bulkheads and utilised a semi-stressed engine and transmission. Twin side radiators were mounted in front of the rear wheels which were located by upper and lower links and radius rods. Driven through a Hewland DG300 five-speed transmission, a Chevrolet powered T332 was once timed at 305kmh (190mph) at the now closed Ontario Motor Speedway in Ontario, California. The T332 dominated the last three years of the US F5000 championship, with Briton Brian Redman taking the title three times in a row in 1974–76, his most serious rivals Al Unser and Mario Andretti, in 1974–75 in Parnelli T332C. Australian driver Warwick Brown used a T332 to win the 1975 Tasman Series as well as the 1975 New Zealand Grand Prix. In doing so he became the only Australian driver to ever win the Tasman Series. New Zealand driver Ken Smith also used a Lola T332 to win the 1976 New Zealand Grand Prix. Ken Smith had obtained Redman's 1974 US winning chassis and a couple of extremely powerful US F5000 chev engines. Lawrence, after a serious accident in the 72 NZGP regained competitive form in a new T332 in the 1974 Tasman and by 1975 had upgraded his chassis to the specs of Andretti's US car and running with real sponsorship from Malboro, Singapore Airlines and Wix, was Warwick Brown's most serious rival during the 1975 Tasman. As a side note, both the 1975 and 1976 New Zealand Grands Prix were held at Pukekohe Park Raceway. It was generally thought in the 1975 Tasman the two best drivers, Graham McRae in a McRae GM2 and Chris Amon in a Talon (a modified version of the GM2) were very much at a disadvantage compared with Lawrence, Brown and Smith in the Lola 332T, although to some extent that was compensated by the very fast Firestone F5000 tyres used by McRae for the last time in NZ which meant McRae took pole or deadheated for pole time in the four kiwi rounds of the last Tasman. McRae himself found his own T332 far faster than his GM2 in the 197475 US Travellers Cheque F5000 series. Although not able to equal the engine preparation of the Haas or Parnelli teams running at F1 level, even in 1975 at Watkins Glen, Laguna Seca and Long Beach, McRae in a T332 was still as quick as Jarier or Unser while his T332 lasted. In Australasia the T400 never matched the T332 although after its disastrous 1975 series, Max Stewarts T400 was often competitive in 1976 and 1977. In the Shellsport F5000 series in 1975, Peter Gethin and Pilete's T400 was probably quicker than the best T332s of Guy Edwards and Ian Ashley and in 1976 Keith Holland in a T400 often matched Edward's and David Purley 3.6 March and Chevron cars. The last two new T332c F5000s in 1977 were built for Alan Jones for the 1977 Australian Tasman rounds and Keith Holland Shellsport campaign that year. During its competition life, the T332 also won the US Formula AF5000 Championship in 1974 and 1975 driven by British driver Brian Redman, the British Formula 5000 Championship in 1974 driven by Formula One driver Bob Evans and the 1979 Australian Drivers' Championship when driven by South Australian Johnnie Walker who also won the 1979 Australian Grand Prix in his T332. Walker also used a T332 to finish second in the 1975 Australian Drivers' Championship.",Normal

In January 2018, as part of Triple M's ""Ozzest 100"", the 'most Australian' songs of all time, ""Beds Are Burning"" was ranked number 9. After Midnight Oil toured through the Outback in 1986, playing to remote Aboriginal communities and seeing first hand the seriousness of the issues in health and living standards, Peter Garrett, Jim Moginie and Rob Hirst wrote ""Beds Are Burning"" to criticize how said populations were often forcibly removed from their lands, highlighted by the pre-chorus lines ""it belongs to them, let's give it back"". Considering such a local affair inspired a worldwide hit, Garrett commented ""Who would have thought an Aboriginal land rights song would travel that far?"" There are specific references to certain Australian places and politics, such as Kintore Ranges and the town of Yuendumu, vehicles produced by the Holden company, the ""It's Time"" slogan and the notion of ""fair go"". In an interview with British website and publication Songwriting Magazine, Rob Hirst discussed how Midnight Oil were determined to be seen as an Australian band. In the same conversation he stated, ""Land rights are something that appear in so many countries around the world, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, but we were determined that Midnight Oil wouldn't be seen as one of those international bands, writing songs that could have come from anywhere. We were determined to put place names and other specific bits and pieces in all our songs."" * Sales figures based on certification alone.^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.

"William Henry Jones MM (13 May 1921– 26 December 2010) was an England international footballer who played for Liverpool. Born in Whaley Bridge, Derbyshire, Jones played for Hayfield St Matthews before Liverpool manager George Kay took him, aged seventeen, to Anfield in September 1938. The Second World War curtailed Jones' early career, although he did appear as a wartime guest for York City, Leeds United and Reading. He made his debut for Liverpool, along with Len Carney and Cyril Sidlow, as a 25-year-old on the opening day of the 1946–47 season, against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. The Reds won 1–0 through a goal scored by Carney. Jones opened his goalscoring account with a brace at Anfield on 7 September 1946 in Liverpool's 7–4 defeat of Chelsea. By the end of the first post-war season, Jones had helped Liverpool to their first Division One championship in 24 years, pipping Manchester United and Wolverhampton Wanderers by a single point. He appeared 26 times during the season, including the title-winning 2–1 victory at Molineux on the final day of the season, and scored six goals. He was a member of the first Liverpool side to appear at Wembley when he appeared in the 2–0 defeat to Arsenal in the 1950 FA Cup Final. Jones made his England debut in a 5–3 win over Portugal at Kenilworth Road, Luton on 14 May 1950. He made his only other international appearance against Belgium the same month. Liverpool were relegated at the end of the 1953–54 season, which was Jones' last for the Reds, for whom he made 277 appearances and scored 17 goals. His last game was a 3–0 defeat to Blackpool on 24 April 1954, at Bloomfield Road. Jones went on to become playermanager at Ellesmere Port, before returning to Liverpool as a scout during the 1960s. His grandson Rob Jones also appeared for both Liverpool and England. On 26 December 2010, Jones died from natural causes at the Countess of Chester Hospital, Chester. Liverpool",Normal
"Kara Arslan Ahmad Qavurt (died 1073), better simply known as Qavurt (also spelled Kavurt) was a Seljuq prince. Upon his brother's death, he led an unsuccessful rebellion against his nephew in an attempt to gain the Seljuk throne. The Seljuq dynasty was a Turkish Sunni Muslim dynasty that established both the Seljuq Empire and Sultanate of Rum, which at their total height stretched from Anatolia through Persia. Qavurt was the son of Çağrı Bey, who was the grandson of Seljuk, the founder of the dynasty. Qavurt's brother Alp Arslan succeeded his uncle Tuğrul as the new sultan and Qavurt then the governor of Kirman (south Persia) waited for his turn. Alp Arslan died in 1072. But before death he willed his throne to Malik Shah I, his second son. He also expressed his concern about possible throne struggles. The main contestants for the throne were his eldest son Ayaz and his brother Qavurt. As a compromise, he willed generous grants to Ayaz and Qavurt. Malik Shah was only 17 or 18 years of age when he ascended to throne. Although Ayaz presented no problem, he faced with the serious problem of Qavurt's rebellion. His vizier Nizam al-Mulk was even more worried for he had become the de facto ruler of the empire during young Malik Shah's reign. Although Qavurt had only a small army, Turkmen officiers in Malik Shah's army tended to support Qavurt. So Malik Shah and Nizam al-Mulk added non Turkic regiments to Seljuk army. Artukids also supported Malik Shah. The clash was at a location known as Kerç kapı (or Kerec ) close to Hamedan on 16 May 1073. Malik Shah was able to defeat Qavurt's forces. Although Qavurt escaped, he was soon arrested. Initially Malik Shah was tolerant to his uncle. But Nizam al-Mulk convinced the young sultan to execute Qavurt. Nizam al-Mulk also executed two of Qavurt's four sons. Later he eliminated most of the Turkic commanders of the army whom he suspected to be Qavurt's partisans. Qavurt's defeat was a blow to Turkic character of the empire. But Qavurt's other sons managed to rule in Kirman as vassals of Malik Shah and their small state lived even longer than that of the Great Seljuk Empire.",Normal

"St. James Parish Church, is located in Holetown, St. James, Barbados. It stands on one of the oldest parcels of consecrated land on the island, often known in Barbados as ""God's acre"". Part of the Diocese of Barbados in the Church in the Province of the West Indies, St. James Parish Church is just north of Holetown, beside Folkestone Park. Daily tours are conducted to share the church's rich history. There are many beautiful monuments, and items of historical value, some dating back to the 1600s. Two services are held every Sunday: a spoken Eucharist at 7:15 am and a sung Eucharist at 9 am. On months with a fifth Sunday, there is one service at 8 am. There are also morning matins on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7:30 am. As well as being a heavily visited tour spot, St. James is also a very popular choice for conducting weddings. The first settlers landed on the island on February 17, 1627 at Holetown not far from the site where the church was eventually built. The settlement there expanded rapidly and it became necessary to erect a place of worship. In 1628 the settlers constructed a wooden building on this site. St. James Parish Church was one of the original six parishes later created under the administration of Sir William Tufton, the sixth Governor of Barbados. After a hurricane on August 31, 1675 which devastated most of the island, a stone structure replaced the former wooden building in the early 1690s. This stone structure was made from coral and limestone from which this non-volcanic island is made. Another violent hurricane struck in 1780 and according to Robert Hermann Schomburgk's History of Barbados only two churches and one chapel remained; St. Andrew, St. Peter and All Saints. There is no specific record of what happened to St. James in the storms of 1675 and 1780 but after the hurricane of 1831 St. James was not among the churches listed as having been destroyed. Schomburgk states that in 1846 at the time of his writing this book, the building was 54' X 40' in size with a seating capacity of 550 and a congregation of approximately '360 souls'. After nearly 200 years the walls of the original stone building began to decay and were partly demolished and replaced by a larger, more substantial structure in 1874. In 1874, the nave roof was raised on new pillars and arches. The enlarged building was consecrated by Bishop Mitchinson on Easter Tuesday, 1875. Except for the sanctuary and north porch, added in 1900s, this is substantially the building still in use today. Many of the original settlers and various noted Barbadians were laid to rest in the Church and its yard. The dates on the grave stones, vaults and memorial plaques reflect this history. The church's first organ was ordered and built by the English firm, Hill & Son, at a cost of 320 pounds. After it arrived in January 1876 and was assembled, the first organist was Charles A. Greenidge and the bellows blower, Reynold W. Gillman. Over time this organ was replaced, with various upgrades performed over the years until the existing instrument was completely rebuilt from 2006–2007 and rededicated in 2008. Some of the pipes and structure still date back about one hundred years. The present organist is Philip Forde FRCO. The original bell, the oldest in Barbados, carries the inscription ""God Bless King William 1696"". It was manufactured by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry that also produced the American ""Liberty Bell"" and ""Big Ben"". It fell from the belfry in 1881 and was badly cracked but a benefactor donated a new bell. However, considering its historic value the old one was sent to England for repairs and returned to Barbados to be retained as a monument, which predates the American ""Liberty Bell"" by 56 years. The Baptistery, on the ground floor of the belfry, contains the original font which is over 300 years old and bears the inscription ""Debit Richardus Walter to the Church of St. James Anno 1684."" There is a popular legend attached to St. James' Church, that a gate in the north wall surrounding the churchyard, referred to as 'The Devil's Gate' is opened about one hour before service. When the bell is rung the Devil leaves the church by this gate, and it is closed as the service is about to begin, so that the Devil is excluded from the area. This is presumably derived from the old belief that church bells were rung to drive the devil out of the building.",Normal

"Muḥammad Junaid, popularly known as Junaid Babunagari (Bengali: জুনায়েদ বাবুনগরী; 8 October 1953 – 19 August 2021), was a Bangladeshi Deobandi Islamic scholar, educator, writer, researcher, Islamic speaker and spiritual figure. He was the Amir of Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh, Shaykhul Hadith of Darul Uloom Hathazari Madrasa, vice-president of Befaqul Madarisil Arabia Bangladesh, Chairman of Chittagong Noorani Talimul Quran Board and Editor-in-Chief of Monthly Mueenul Islam. Muhammad Junaid was born on 8 October 1953, in the village of Babunagar in Fatikchhari Thana, Chittagong District, East Bengal, Pakistan (now Bangladesh). He belonged to a Bengali Muslim family of theologians and Qadis hailing from the village of Dhurung. His father, Muhammad Abul Hasan, was a scholar of Quranic exegesis and senior professor at Al-Jamiatul Ahlia Darul Ulum Moinul Islam in Hathazari. Junaid's lineage is as follows: Muḥammad Junaid ibn Muḥammad Abū al-Ḥasan ibn Nadhīr Aḥmad ibn Shākir ʿAlī ibn Ghulām Nabī ibn Kahūlan ibn Muʿīn ad-Dīn al-Qāḍī ibn ʿAyn ad-Dīn al-Qāḍī. His mother, Fatimah Khatun, was the daughter of Harun Babunagari, founder of Al-Jamiatul Islamiah Azizul Uloom Babunagar. His mother's paternal grandfather, Sufi Azizur Rahman, was one of the founders of the Hathazari madrasa and a descendant of Caliph Abu Bakr. Junaid had three brothers and two sisters. Two of his younger brothers are Shuaib Babunagari, Ustadh of Babunagar Madrasa, and Zubair Babunagari, Muhaddith of Sultanpur Madrasa in Raozan. His sister, Rashidah, is married to Bengali author Abu Jafar Shahadat, former imam of Jamiatul Falah Mosque. His other sister, Mahmuda Khatun, is married to Mawlana Zakariyyah, principal of a madrasa in Madarsha. At the age of five, he entered Al-Jamiatul Islamiah Azizul Uloom Babunagar where he completed his hifz and basic Islamic and primary studies. After reading the entire Quran off by heart to Azharul Islam Dharmapuri, Babunagari proceeded to study at the Al-Jamiatul Ahlia Darul Ulum Moinul Islam in Hathazari in 1966. In 1976, he completed his master's in Hadith studies at the madrasa where he was also first place in the examinations. Babunagari was then admitted to the Jamia Uloom-ul-Islamia in Karachi, Pakistan. He studied advanced Hadith studies for four years under Yusuf Banuri. His thesis was titled Sīrah al-Imām ad-Dārimī wa at-Tarīkh bi-Shaykhihī (Biography of Imam Darimi and the history of his teachers) in 1978. Returning to Bangladesh in 1978, he began teaching at Al-Jamiatul Islamiah Azizul Uloom Babunagar and moved a few year later to Al-Jamiatul Ahlia Darul Ulum Moinul Islam in Hathazari. When Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh was formed in 2010, he became its secretary general. He was briefly imprisoned in the aftermath of the 2013 Shapla Square protests.

"The television series Sabrina the Teenage Witch has hosted a wide array of characters and guests over its series run. Sabrina and Salem are the only two characters to remain on the show throughout all consecutive seven seasons and all three made-for-TV movies. Sabrina is depicted from the middle of high school through all the way to marriage. On her 16th birthday, she learned that she was a half-witch (through her father's side) and had magical powers. She also learned that her two aunts were witches themselves and that their black cat Salem was a witch who had been turned into a talking household pet as a punishment for attempting worldwide domination. At Westbridge High, she befriended Jenny Kelley (and later Valerie Birkhead in seasons 2 and 3) and had an on-again, off-again relationship with Harvey Kinkle. She also has to deal with her Vice Principal Kraft who dates her aunt Zelda and then in season 4 becomes principal and stops dating Zelda and then goes back on and again not due to car crashes. In the finale they finally stop dating due to Salem driving a car into him. In season 4, Harvey believes Sabrina is cheating on him. They get back together later in Season 4 and then break up again when Harvey discovers she's a witch. She also had to deal with the snobby and headstrong cheerleader Libby Chessler, who became Sabrina's rival for school activities as well as Harvey's affections. Sabrina also at some points transforms herself into Libby to gain popularity (Libby is the queen of the school) for her ""dorky"" activities. In later seasons, Sabrina was enrolled at the fictional Adams College in Boston. Her roommates are gloomy Roxie, fashion-glamour Morgan, and paranormal activist Miles, who, at one point almost got Sabrina exposed as a witch. After getting her degree in journalism she moved back to her aunts' house with Morgan and Roxie. She took a job with the fictitious ScorchMagazine, a music theme magazine where she interviewed famous artists. Later on, she met a man named Aaron, who also worked in the music industry and the two began dating. Before long, Aaron proposed and in the finale, the two were set to wed when unforeseen events take place. She started to suspect that Aaron was not the one and after Sabrina had tried to connect her soul stone with his, she was sure of it. While it mostly fit, it was not a perfect fit. She tried to ignore it, but followed her heart and canceled the marriage at the altar. When she ran out of the church, she found Harvey waiting for her outside on his motorcycle, holding his soul stone that Amanda, her cousin, had left him. After both Harvey and Sabrina's soul stones were tossed to the side and fit together perfectly, it proved that those two are destined to be together and they rode off together into the distance in true finale fashion at 12:36 on the dot, the same hour they first met. Sabrina's magic takes the form of yellow sparks. Hildegarde Antoinette ""Hilda"" Spellman (played by Sherry Miller in the 1996 movie, then Caroline Rhea in the series) is one of Sabrina's aunts, a 642-year-old European witch who is Zelda's younger sister both of whom moved at some point to America. She is often portrayed as the less pragmatic of the two aunts, and constantly worries about things that could be considered superficial. Hilda was also the more outgoing and fun-loving aunt. She was formerly engaged to Drell, head of the Witches Council (played by Penn Jillette), and they were set to marry, but Drell jilted Hilda, and their engagement was called off. She also dated Sabrina's vice principal, Mr. Kraft, until she begins to hate him (with Sabrina) and they desperately try to break him and Zelda apart when Zelda begins to date him. During the college seasons, she became the owner of the coffee shop where Sabrina and Josh worked, and where many of the show's scenes took place. At one point, Hilda tried to help Salem Saberhagen in his quest to conquer the mortal realm, but, when he was caught, convicted and transformed into a cat, Hilda was punished with the job of keeping him worm-free (a job Sabrina took on when Hilda left the series). However, she was pardoned in the final episode of season five, though she decided to keep custody of Salem anyway. It is also claimed by her sister that she caused the American Revolution. For the first three seasons, Hilda played a violin, but was clearly not very good at it as she failed at every audition: In one episode, the violin came flying through the patio doors, and the bow went right through it like an arrow through a heart. At the start of Season 4, Hilda gave up on her violin, and blew it up with a stick of dynamite. She bought a clock shop which had a magical Lost in Time clock in the back room; whenever famous people in the past centuries made a mistake at some point in their lives, they would become lost in time, and Hilda and Zelda had to try to figure out what went wrong. By the start of Season 5, though, the clock shop was out of business, and Hilda bought the coffee shop much to Sabrina's annoyance as she had just moved out of her aunt's house, and was now living with Roxie, Morgan, and Miles. Hilda often made a great fuss over the silliest things: For example, in one episode, Hilda ran for office after a politician publicly stated that her coffee was too expensive. She lost the election without a single vote (the one vote she did receive was disqualified because it was signed with a pawprint rather than a signature, indicating that Salem was the voter in question). As Sabrina's time in college came to an end, Hilda met her soul mate, a train conductor on the Halloween Express, and impulsively married him. However, it almost did not happen after Zelda and Sabrina meddled for what they thought were the right reasons. Hilda later came back in Season 7 to attend Sabrina's wedding. Hilda's magic takes the form of puffs of white smoke. Zelda Spellman (played in the 1996 movie by Charlene Fernetz, then Beth Broderick in the series) is Sabrina's brainy aunt who is always engaging in new scientific experiments. She is often referred to as a quantum physicist. Zelda is a 659-year-old European witch who at some point moved along with her sister to America. She sometimes teaches at Westbridge High, and (in later seasons) Adams College. In one episode she says she has been accredited with discovering 17 moons. Zelda often plays the role of the mature, logical one, to bring Sabrina and sometimes Hilda back to earth after they attempt some zany scheme or otherwise get into trouble. Towards the end of Sabrina's time in college, Zelda gave up her adult years to bring a broken Sabrina back to life. As a child again, Zelda left Sabrina to run her own life, upon Sabrina's request. Young Zelda in the first episode of season 7 was played by Alexandra Hart-Gilliams (who played Ally in season 3). Zelda came back with Hilda, during Sabrina's wedding in Season 7, only this time as a candle. Zelda was volunteered by Hilda to become a candle for the duration of Sabrina's wedding so that Sabrina's mother could attend the wedding and not become a ball of wax, per her Witches' Council curse. Zelda is more strict than Hilda. Her magic takes the form of purple sparks. Harvey Kinkle (played in the 1996 movie by Tobias Mehler, then Nate Richert in the series) is a mortal boy whose full name is Harvey Dwight Kinkle. As revealed in episode 62 (season 3), he has some Slavic ancestry. He was close friends with Sabrina, Salem, Roxie, Morgan, Jenny, Valerie and Brad Alcerro. Harvey is portrayed as a very popular and athletic young man, though not very bright. He is second string on the football team, and the object of affection of Libby Chessler, fueling Sabrina's rivalry with her. The character was first introduced in the comics in Archie's TV Laugh-Out #1 (December 1969). Harvey was Sabrina's boyfriend until the 4th season, when he discovered that she was a witch in the season finale. The reason for this was that Sabrina had cast too many spells on him over the years and, when the limit was reached, his memory was no longer erased after each spell was reversed. After this, Harvey left the show. Harvey made a few brief appearances during Season Five. In ""Do You See What I See?"", Harvey called Sabrina and apologized for the way he acted after learning she was a witch. Harvey returned to the show full-time in Season Six. Sabrina's Great Aunt Irma (played by Barbara Eden) later discovered Harvey knew Sabrina was a witch, and put him on trial to make sure he was trustworthy. Harvey was first attached to a lie detector which was not even plugged in, strapped to a spit and cooked, and even put on the torture rack, but he finally convinced Irma that Sabrina's secret was safe with him, and she let him go. Harvey became Morgan's boyfriend for a time, but had developed feelings for Sabrina again, even coming to her rescue a couple of times. In season 7, it is revealed that Harvey is still in love with her. He makes Aaron jealous since he is Sabrina's ex and they are still close. In ""Spellmanian Slip"", Harvey still has a special place in Sabrina's heart (with a room of his own). In ""A Fish Tale"", Harvey has also shown himself to be unselfish; when Aunt Irma turned Aaron into a goldfish, Sabrina tried unsuccessfully to reverse the spell, so she gave up her magic; Harvey harnessed Sabrina's magic, and changed Aaron back. When Sabrina talked to Aunt Irma, she found out that Harvey was able to undo her spell because he wanted to make Sabrina happy (which, in Irma's opinion was a more powerful motivation than Sabrina's, which was to defy Irma). Sabrina went to Harvey's apartment, only to find him gone; she found only a cardboard box with the vase that contained Sabrina's magic, a picture of them together, and a good luck note. In the series finale, Sabrina realized that she and Harvey were soul mates, and she abandoned her wedding and rode off with him, her first and true love. Salem Saberhagen (voiced by Nick Bakay) is a 500-year-old warlock who was a criminal of the Other Realm and was sentenced to spend 100 years as a cat as punishment for attempting to take over the world. He was sent to live with Hilda who was punished with keeping Salem worm-free. Despite his megalomaniacal desires for world domination (which he attempts periodically throughout the series), he is generally portrayed as having a good heart and being a loyal friend to Sabrina. In the series he would generally serve two roles: one as a mentor for Sabrina, as she found it easier to go to him with her messier problems, or the trouble-maker, such as finding another illicit way to become human without being punished or convincing Sabrina to use magic to solve her problems, both of which generally ended up putting Sabrina in even more trouble. When Sabrina's aunts left for the Other Realm, Salem stayed with Sabrina, and continued his attempts to become human. Salem became good pals with Harvey after he returned to the series, and would generally attempt to abuse this friendship to get some more power to take over the world. Salem also went on vacations with Sabrina in the made-for-television movies. Salem has a grown-up daughter named Annabelle. Salem was seen in human form a couple of times in flashbacks (as a teenager and adult), but his face was always obstructed from view, although Nick Bakay did make a cameo appearance in ""A Girl And Her Cat"" as a man who tries to kiss Zelda when Sabrina and her aunts were knocking on doors, looking for Salem. 50 more years were added to Salem's sentence at the end of the episode Salem, the Boy in Season 3. At the end of the series 32 years of his imprisonment are over, meaning he has 68 more years until his punishment is terminated (if he behaves, of course). In ""Spellmanian Slip"", he states that he wishes that Sabrina would marry Harvey. Jenny is a mortal character, Sabrina's best friend in the first season until Michelle Beaudoin left the show. Her disappearance is never mentioned or explained. Jenny had a powerful social conscience, was a vegetarian, and a very honest and loyal friend. She always dreamed of other worlds behind closets. Her dream came true when she accidentally entered the linen closet and met Drell. Drell turned her into a grasshopper, but she was saved by Sabrina and her aunts by making Jenny believe everything was a dream. Jenny was very imaginative and whimsical. Played by Jenna Leigh Green, Libby is a snobby, rich, and spoiled cheerleader who delighted in tormenting Sabrina and her friends. She often referred to Sabrina as a ""freak"", and, while ignorant of the fact that Sabrina was a witch, she suspected that Sabrina was different. Libby is the mean girl of the series. Libby's major conflict with Sabrina revolved around the girls' competition for the affection of Harvey Kinkle, who clearly preferred Sabrina. Only a few personal details are known about Libby. She was once dubbed ""pure evil"" but simply took this as a compliment. She apparently comes from extreme wealth, and lives in a step-family arrangement of some sort. Her mother appeared in the episode ""Five Easy Pieces of Libby"" and is played by Cristine Rose; the mother is much like the daughter—snobby and mean-spirited. She has a stepbrother, Russell, who is seen in the episode ""Sabrina Claus"", and is played by Richard Taylor Olson; he and Libby have a combative relationship. In one episode, Sabrina accidentally turned her into a puzzle, so Sabrina had to learn more about her. She found out that Libby is bad in math, she takes after her mother in that she is rude and snobby, and that her grandma is very close to her heart. Her appearances generally involve her being mean to Sabrina and others, and getting poetic justice at the end of the episode. At the start of season 4, Libby was sent off to boarding school and was never seen again. Valerie is Sabrina Spellman and Harvey Kinkle's mortal best friend at Westbridge High School. She is also despised by headstrong cheerleader Libby, who rivals both her and Sabrina for much of the show. Valerie remains Sabrina's best friend until she moves to Anchorage, Alaska, in 1999. She is a shy and often awkward girl who looks up to Sabrina despite being quite bright herself. Valerie often expresses her wish to be in the ""cool crowd"" even trying her hand, and winning a spot on the second string cheerleading squad in season 3, much to the worry of Sabrina who feared Valerie would transform into a mean, spiteful person like Libby. At the start of Season 4, she moved to Alaska with her family. She had agreed to move in with Sabrina to attend their senior year together, but then she decided to stay in Alaska instead. She was played by American actress Lindsay Sloane. ""Mr. Kraft"", as he is often addressed on the show, is portrayed by Martin Mull. He is an administrator at Westbridge High School and regularly issues detentions at the drop of a hat (sometimes literally). He also expresses a personal dislike for Sabrina, Harvey, and Valerie (particularly Sabrina), and occasionally gives them detentions simply because he does not like them. He started out as Vice Principal in the second and third seasons before becoming principal in Season 4. He is known to have one brother and one sister. Mr. Kraft dated both Hilda and Zelda during the show, causing complications for Sabrina. Mr. Kraft is a mortal, but in one of the episodes where Sabrina and Hilda try to separate Zelda and Mr. Kraft, they find out that he was once married to a witch (named Lucy, played by actress Julia Duffy) who tried using her magic to trick Mr. Kraft as revenge for leaving her. At the end of season 4, Zelda breaks up with Mr. Kraft, who is then hit by a car, thanks to joyriding Hilda, and again by a joyriding Salem, and is never seen again. Dreama is a young girl who has Sabrina Spellman as a quiz master. Dreama is learning how to use her magic in the episodes of season 4. She is quite clumsy in the beginning. She gets turned into a mouse in one episode by Brad, but she is turned back when Brad's witch hunting gene is removed. Sabrina helps her learn and control her powers. Josh is a mortal guy that runs the coffee shop and gave Sabrina the job. Technically, Josh is her manager, although the relationship is somewhat different because Sabrina's aunt Hilda later owns the shop. Josh is interested in photography, and manages to sell one of his photographs for $1,000 (with Sabrina's magical help). He was attracted to Sabrina in the fourth season, but at that time she was dating Harvey. He often acted jealously towards Harvey, and got a mostly negative review by the fans of the show. In the fifth season he dated Morgan, and then in the sixth season he dated Sabrina. In this season Sabrina is willing to tell Josh she is a witch, so that she can tell him she loves him, but in the end she does not have to and he never figures it out. In the Season 6 finale, Sabrina gambles her love life in order to bring her Aunt Hilda back to life because of this Josh took the offer in Prague, and he was never seen again. Sabrina later discovers she is meant to be with Harvey. He was played by David Lascher, formerly of the Nickelodeon series Hey Dude. Roxie, a mortal, was introduced to the show in Season 5 as Sabrina's college roommate. At first she dislikes Sabrina, but they later became best friends. Roxie is environmentally conscious and sometimes staged protests. She is a cynical character who puts up the front that she despises the thought that her housemate Miles has romantic interests in her. However, in ""You Can't Twin"", she has a dream about Miles and many episodes hint a romantic future for the two of them. In a Valentine's Day episode, Sabrina casts a spell on Roxie to make her see the good points of Miles, bringing out an exaggeration of her possible true feelings for him. In Season 7, Roxie became one of the leading characters in the absence of Sabrina's aunts. She was played by Soleil Moon Frye, formerly of NBC's Punky Brewster from 1984 until 1988, and the cartoon spinoff It's Punky Brewster in 1985. Morgan, a mortal, was introduced in season five as one of Sabrina's college housemates and resident adviser. When she was first introduced, she spoke with a normal tone (much how Elisa Donovan, the actress who played Morgan, speaks) but as the series progressed she developed, and spoke in, a more high-pitched tone. She is very shallow, superficial and over-assertive, but she became one of Sabrina's best friends. She dated both Josh and Harvey (among many others). In a Christmas episode, Morgan invites Sabrina to spend the holidays with her family, since she finds dealing with them alone quite daunting. In the seventh season, Morgan's supporting role becomes a leading one in the absence of Sabrina's aunts. Miles is a mortal character that was introduced in the fifth season as one of Sabrina's college housemates. His behavior was endearingly abnormal and he was a conspiracy theorist, something his family did not exactly approve of. Miles had romantic interests in Roxie, but she did not outwardly reciprocate. However, in a Valentine's Day storyline, Sabrina cast a spell on Roxie to soften her feelings towards an initially frightened Miles. In another episode it was revealed that he is a huge fan of Adrienne Barbeau. It is hinted in many episodes that Miles and Roxie become a couple in the future, even to the stage of marrying and having children. In the episode ""I Fall To Pieces"", Miles finally began to notice the unusual behavior of Sabrina's witch-turned-cat Salem. Unfortunately, Miles was never seen again and his disappearance was never explained (on-screen) although in one of the season 7 episodes the reporter on the TV can be heard saying ""Goodman was shot today"" possibly implying he has died. Miles was played by Trevor Lissauer. Aaron is Sabrina's last mortal boyfriend, who appears in the seventh season. She meets Aaron at the Scorch magazine office. They become engaged but Sabrina's aunt Irma turns him into a goldfish but Aaron is turned back when Harvey (who is in love with Sabrina) uses Sabrina's magic because he wants to make Sabrina happy. In the series finale, Sabrina prepares for her wedding but stops it when she realizes Aaron is not her soulmate and she runs off with Harvey, her soulmate and first true love (they are soulmates because when their soul stones drop to the ground they fit perfectly) at 12:36, the time they first met seven years ago. and whom Sabrina chose to be her groom. He gets jealous of Harvey since he is still close with Sabrina. Aaron was played by Dylan Neal. Brad was Harvey's best friend from Texas. He was not very nice to Sabrina. Sabrina later learned that Brad had a rare witch-hunting gene that made those who have it want to ferret out witches, which explained why he did not like Sabrina; because he sensed the magic in her (although he didn't know that) and it made him suspicious. Should a witch reveal herself to a witch-hunter, she is condemned to spend the next century as a mouse. Unfortunately, Dreama just happened to do this, and she became a mouse. The only way to restore her without waiting 100 years was to remove Brad's witch-hunting gene (which was literally a tiny pair of blue jeans) within 1-hour before the mouse form becomes permanent. With the witch-hunting gene gone, Brad's relationship with Sabrina became slightly friendlier, and Sabrina can use magic on him without ever risking exposure or becoming a mouse. Brad's departure was never explained. Brad was played by Jon Huertas. Mr. Pool is mortal. He is Sabrina's favorite teacher who teaches Biology until Paul Feig left the show after season 1. He was sometimes bitter and sarcastic, but always interesting and usually lively. In one episode, Sabrina casts a spell that endows him with the knowledge of changing lead to gold, but is later forced to retract the knowledge due difficulties it would have caused. Mr. Pool, who had benefited greatly from the knowledge, was very unhappy when he lost it. In the episode ""As Westbridge Turns"", he reveals that Sabrina is one of his best students. In that same episode, he also plans to marry the school nurse, who ends up running away with the new janitor. Mr. Pool's response to that situation was a calm, ""Meh. I got farther than I thought I would."" Albert is Sabrina's quizmaster in season 2 with the job of teaching her how to use magic rightfully so that she can receive her witches' license after a year of witch training. Though Sabrina likes to work with him, she often finds him annoying. In spite of disliking him a little, she found that she couldn't have any Quizmaster but Albert teach her. The Quizmaster taught Sabrina how to turn herself into fire, water and wind, which is said to be very hard for a witch to do. Throughout the year, he was only known as Quizmaster; however, his name is revealed on ""Quiz Show"" episode of season 2. It turns out to be ""Albert"", but they decide to stick with Quizmaster instead. The actor who played him (Alimi Ballard) left the show after the second season, as Sabrina receives her witches' license, giving the character no further role in the series. He had a strange but colorful clothing style and was afraid of clowns. Gwen is British witch, played by Tara Strong (credited with her maiden name Charendoff), who only appears in the movies Sabrina Goes to Rome and Sabrina, Down Under, as Sabrina's friend during her travels. Like Dreama, she has a hard time controlling her magic and her spells never work the way she expects them to; while Sabrina casts spells with her index finger, Gwen casts spells by clenching her fist. She is shown to have a liking for jellybeans. In the first film, she aided Sabrina in solving the mystery of her family locket, while also facing her own dilemma after she accidentally turned her crush, Alberto, into a pigeon; in order to reverse the spell, she went around randomly kissing pigeons (the only way to reverse the spell) and eventually succeeded. In the second film, she goes on holiday with Sabrina in the Australian Great Barrier Reef, where she helps Sabrina to prevent the destruction of a mermaid colony at the hands of water pollution and a greedy marine biologist. By the time of the second film, she has gained more control over her powers through practice, but has yet to completely perfect them; upon reuniting with Sabrina, she demonstrates this by transforming Sabrina's shell necklace into a flower lei, but unintentionally gave her a rabbit's tail in the process; in response to this, Gwen explains, ""In my defense, I didn't say I was good; just said I was better."" Throughout the series, Sabrina met members of her family who were also witches. Throughout Season Three, relatives would come to the Spellman house for a visit, and at the end of their visit, they would give Sabrina a clue to the family secret. Sabrina did not solve it until the Season Three finale: ""Every member of the Spellman family is born with a twin"". Here are some of Sabrina's relatives. In Season Four, Hilda bought a clock shop which had what seemed like an ordinary grandfather clock in the back room. However it turned out to be a magical Lost in Time clock from which certain people from past centuries or decades emerged. These people included: Many episodes involve Sabrina getting to meet, through natural or supernatural means, popular real-life musical artists of the time, including the band of Melissa Joan Hart's then-boyfriend (now husband) Mark Wilkerson, appeared in an episode in 2002.",Normal
"Everardus ""Edu"" Snethlage (9 May 1886 – 12 January 1941) was a Dutch physician and footballer who played as a forward for HVV Quick and the Netherlands national team, becoming the all-time top scorer of the latter in 1909. Snethlage spent his entire playing career at HVV Quick in The Hague, thus being part of the so-called one-club men group. In total, he scored 53 goals in over 80 matches for the club, with his goalscoring performances proving crucial in helping the club win the Dutch championship in 1908, as well as three consecutive KNVB Cups between 1909 and 1911, netting once in a 6–1 win over HBS Craeyenhout in the final, to help his side win the only Cup title in the club's history. He was a member of the team that won the bronze medal in the football tournament of the 1908 Summer Olympics. Everardus Snethlage was born on 9 May 1886 in Ngawi, Dutch East Indies, to a former German pastoral family. Snethlage began playing football with HVV Quick, which he joined in June 1901, at the age of 15, together with his two-year older brother Bram, who would also make it to the first team. Snethlage would only play in the lower teams for a year. As early as 1903, barely 17 years old, he was already a regular in the first team. Initially, Snethlage played in midfield as a right winger, but from the 1906–07 season onwards, he was drafted into the frontline, first as a center forward, but soon as inside right. This adjustment proved to be a game-changer as he formed for years a formidable attacking partnership with Caius Welcker, as they formed the most feared right wing that the Netherlands had known until that time. The two of them were nicknamed ""scientific"" by the media, likely referring to them being students. They played a crucial role in helping HVV Quick become the champions of the Netherlands in 1908, a championship in which they played together in every match. After a match in Antwerp against ""Manchester University"", he was declared the star of the match by the English referee James, who stated that ""Snethlage is one of the few players in (continental) Europe that is at the same level as the English professional footballers"", and adding that he would be in the highest salary class in England as a professional. Snethlage was indeed so coveted by the English that Hull City FC offered him a professional contract in 1909 during a trip from Quick to Sheffield, but although he feels honored, he immediately rejects the offer because he wanted to establish himself as a doctor in the Dutch East Indies, where he was born, and certainly not as a professional football player. At the end of 1909, Bolton Wanderers also tried to persuade Snethlage to play for them in two games around Christmas, but this offer was also declined. On 19 December 1909, Snethlage scored twice in the home game against HBS. They would prove to be his last league goals as a knee injury made it impossible for him to play football. In the second half of the 1909–10 season, he missed 8 of the 9 games and only played in the home game against HFC Haarlem on 6 February 1910, in which he dropped out halfway through the second half. Snethlage did start the 1910–11 season, but fell out just before half-time in the game for the Zilveren Bal against Velocitas from Breda, because of the same knee injury that had also sidelined him for most of the second half of the previous season. Snethlage retired shortly after, having been only 24 years old at the time. Snethlage represented the Dutch team team at the 1908 Summer Olympics, playing both matches as an inside right as he helped his nation win the bronze medal in the football tournament. Snethlage spent the night before the bronze medal match in the London nightlife, emerging only at the field with just a few minutes to go. The manager Edgar Chadwick was furious, but put Snethlage on the team, who played great and scored the second and decisive goal in a 2–0 win over Sweden. In all of his international matches, Snethlage formed the right wing together with Caius Welcker, just like with Quick. Coincidentally, Snethlage's international career started with a 12–2 defeat against England amateurs, the biggest loss in the history of the Dutch team, and ended against the same opponent with a 9–1 loss, being the captain in the latter. Between these two games, Snethlage played a further nine, scoring 10 goals. Snethlage became the all-time top scorer for the Netherlands national team on 21 March 1909. His opening goal of the match against Belgium was his seventh goal for the Netherlands, breaking the then record of six goals that Eddy de Neve had held since 14 May 1905. Snethlage improved his record by scoring a hat-trick in the Low Countries derby against Belgium on 25 April 1909. He was, therefore, the first player to reach double figures for the Netherlands national team and retired from the team being its all-time top scorer. When he sustained his knee injury, Snethlage had been in the Netherlands starting eleven for eleven consecutive international matches, and thus, without a knee injury, Snethlage sould have played more international matches. His record was superseded on 16 October 1910, when Jan Thomée scored his eleventh goal for the Netherlands in a match against Germany. In addition to the Netherlands national team, Snethlage also played for the Western national team, albeit only once. On 15 March 1908, the West defeated the Eastern team 7-2 at the PW site in Enschede. Snethlage also played for the De Zwaluwen team. Snethlage scored the very first goal in the history of De Zwaluwen on 21 November 1907 at the HVV site when two Zwaluwen test teams played against each other there. On 23 May 1909, Snethlage played for the last time in Zwaluwenverband in Amsterdam on the grounds of RAP against the Bolton Wanderers. Here too he formed the right wing with Welcker. Despite the heavy defeat, Snethlage had apparently made a big impression on the ""Trotters"" given the offer Snethlage received six months later to play with Bolton. Snethlage took the State Examination for admission to the University's Faculty of Medicine from 25 to 27 August 1904, and passed. Snethlage went to study at Leiden and in October 1906 passed the preparatory examination in medicine, followed in July 1908 by the bachelor's examination, and finally in September 1911 by the doctoraal examination in medicine. For the last part of his training, Snethlage left for Amsterdam, where he was promoted to physician on 31 May 1913 by the State Medical Commission. After retiring from football in late 1910, he returned to the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and practiced as a doctor. Snethlage has been married twice. On 6 February 1925, he married Louise Henriette Van der Jagt in Soerabaja, which marriage ended in divorce in the early 1930s. A second marriage took place on 15 June 1931 with Wilhelmina Maria Antonia Josephina Van der Poel. Both marriages remained childless. Snethlage died on 19 October 1940, at the age of 54. The cause is unknown, but it cannot have anything to do with World War II because the Japanese would not invade the country until a year later. Snethlage's burial at the General Cemetery in Medan attracted great interest. HVV Netherlands This biographical article related to association football in the Netherlands, about a forward, is a stub.

"North Rowan High School, formerly Spencer High School and East Spencer High School, is located in the north eastern end of Rowan County in Spencer, North Carolina. It is part of the Rowan–Salisbury School System. In the spring of 1959, North Rowan High School was accredited by the Southern Association of Secondary Schools and Colleges. The first principal of North Rowan was Johnson H. Steelman. Camden was the second. On August 4, 1958, the Rowan County Board voted unanimously to name the North Rowan High School athletic field ""The James Carr Eagle Athletic Field"". On September 21, 1958, the building was dedicated with Dr. Charles Carroll, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, as speaker at the ceremonies. Begun in 2001 by the class of 1973, the North Rowan Alumni Memorial Scholarship has assisted nine outstanding graduates with college expenses. These students are currently enrolled in college. The campaign goal is to create a fund of $500,000.00 from which the earnings will be used to fund a full four-year tuition scholarship for a graduate of North Rowan High School deemed worthy. In May 2012, a social studies teacher by the name of Tanya Dixon-Neely was suspended for telling a student not to disrespect President Barack Obama, claiming that ""criticism of the president could lead to jail time.""

"The Indianapolis Colts are a professional American football team based in Indianapolis, Indiana. They are currently members of the South Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The club was officially founded in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1953, as the Baltimore Colts, replacing a previous team of that name that folded in 1950. After 31 seasons in Baltimore, Colts owner Robert Irsay moved the team to Indianapolis. The Colts have had 33 starting quarterbacks (QB) in the history of their franchise. The Colts' past starting quarterbacks include Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Johnny Unitas, as well as the Associated Press National Football League Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) winners Earl Morrall and Bert Jones. Unitas also won the MVP award three times in his career. The franchise's first starting quarterback was Fred Enke, who started 9 games in total for the Colts. The Colts' starting quarterback from 1998 to 2011 was 5-time MVP Peyton Manning. Manning's tenure was followed by Andrew Luck from 2012 to 2018, until his sudden retirement during the 2019 preseason. Originally meant to serve as a backup, Jacoby Brissett ended up starting 15 games for the Colts in the 2017 season due to Luck being injured, and threw for over 3,000 yards and 13 touchdowns; he returned to his backup role the following year. Following Luck's retirement prior to the 2019 season, Brissett became the Colts full-time starting quarterback. Prior to the 2020 season, the Colts signed free agent Philip Rivers, making Brissett again the backup quarterback. On February 18, 2021, the Colts traded a 2021 third round pick and a 2022 second round conditional pick to the Philadelphia Eagles for quarterback Carson Wentz. Brissett signed as a free agent with the Miami Dolphins, and Wentz became the Colts' starting quarterback. He started all seventeen of the Colts' games in the league's first season in the new format, before being traded to the Washington Commanders. Indianapolis then traded a 3rd-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft for longtime Atlanta Falcons star Matt Ryan, who started at quarterback in each of the Colts' first seven games to begin the 2022 season.  The Colts struggled early on to find consistency and stability at the quarterback position with 5 different quarterbacks starting at least one game in the first two seasons of the franchise. George Shaw became the first Colts quarterback to complete a full season. The following year Shaw broke his leg in the fourth game of the season against the Chicago Bears allowing former Pittsburgh Steeler quarterback Johnny Unitas a chance to start. Over the next 16 seasons Unitas would start 182 games for the Colts. In this time Unitas was named to 10 Pro-Bowls, and won the MVP award 3 times. With Unitas under center the Colts also won 2 NFL Championships and a Super Bowl. In the final game of the 1968 preseason, the muscles in Unitas' arm were torn when he was hit by a member of the Dallas Cowboys defense. The Colts would turn to backup quarterback Earl Morrall to lead the offense. The Colts marched to a league-best 13–1 record and Morrall was named the 1968 MVP. Despite this strong season and the return of Unitas during the game the Colts lost the Super Bowl to the AFL's New York Jets and their quarterback Joe Namath. In 1970 the Colts, with Unitas under center, would return to the Super Bowl in 1970. After Unitas was injured in the second quarter Morrall stepped in and led the Colts from a 7-point deficit at half time to a 3-point victory over the Dallas Cowboys. Unitas continued as the Colts' legendary QB, but age and injuries began to plague him further and in a hotly debated move, GM Joe Thomas traded him to the San Diego Chargers. The team wasted no time replacing Unitas by drafting Bert Jones in the 1973 NFL Draft. During his eight-year tenure as the Colts' starting quarterback, Jones led the team to three consecutive AFC East division titles and was awarded the 1976 AP MVP award. The Colts regular season success wasn't replicated in the post season, however, with the team losing all three of their playoff games – first the Steelers in 1975 and 1976, then in 1977 a 37–31 loss to the Oakland Raiders, known as the ""Ghost to the Post"" game and the third longest playoff game ever. It would be the last playoff game ever played by the Baltimore Colts. Jones began to become injury prone and between that and poor personnel moves, the Colts suffered hard times in the late 1970searly 1980s. Jones was then traded to the Rams in 1982 and the Colts again began a search for a new starting quarterback. In the interim quarterback Mike Pagel filled in as the starter. In the 1983 NFL Draft the Colts drafted quarterback John Elway, but in another hotly debated and oft-criticized move, Elway declined to play for the team that drafted him, insisting he would play professional baseball instead. The Colts' owner traded him to the Denver Broncos for quarterback Mark Herrmann, rights to offensive lineman Chris Hinton and a first-round pick in the 1984 NFL Draft. Even at the time it was considered a horrible trade for the Colts and a coup for the Broncos. Mike Pagel therefore remained as the starter, though sometimes losing his position to top draft pick Art Schlichter, who was a notorious bust, due largely to a gambling addiction which affected his play and ultimately saw him kicked out of the league. In the 1986, the Colts selected Jack Trudeau in the 2nd round of the draft. Trudeau would remain the starter for the next few years, though Gary Hogeboom and Chris Chandler were obtained and started at various times. In 1987 Trudeau lead the Colts in their first playoff game since the team moved to Indianapolis. The Colts lost the game against the Cleveland Browns by a score of 38 to 21. In 1990, the Colts again had the 1st overall and selected quarterback Jeff George, who even then was known as a world-class talent with a questionable attitude. This proved to be accurate, as George's four years in Indianapolis would end with four years of erratic play (behind an admittedly so-so team) with a trade to the Atlanta Falcons. In 1994 the Colts signed Jim Harbaugh. In 1995, Harbaugh and the Colts surprised everyone by reaching the playoffs. Harbaugh was voted to the Pro Bowl, named Comeback Player of the Year, and was runner-up in the AP NFL MVP voting. The post-season was even more surprising, as Harbaugh led the Colts all the way to the 1995 AFC Championship game, ending a playoff drought of 24 years without a playoff win and narrowly missing a Super Bowl berth on the last play of the game. After a last-place 3–13 record in 1997, Harbaugh was traded to the Baltimore Ravens. In 1998 the Colts, for the 4th time in 15 years, held the 1st overall pick in the draft and for the 3rd time in 15 years selected a quarterback – this time University of Tennessee's Peyton Manning. Manning started the first game of his rookie season and started every single Colts game since until the start of the 2011 season, when a recurring neck injury sidelined him. Despite a difficult rookie season, where he threw a league high 28 interceptions, Manning and the Colts responded by finishing 13–3 in 1999. The 10 game turnaround from the previous year set an NFL record. Even with this turnaround, the Colts lost in the playoffs. The following years would be marked by a near constant pattern. The Colts and Manning successes in the regular season were matched only by their failures in the post season. Manning was named to the Pro Bowl in 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2004, as well as winning the NFL MVP award in both 2003 and 2004. In 2004 Manning set a then NFL record when he threw 49 touchdowns in a single season. In spite of this the team failed in the playoffs, including early round exits in 1999, 2000, 2002 and 2005. In both 2003 and 2004 the Colts would lose to eventual Super Bowl winning New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game and the Divisional Round respectively. In 2006 the Colts and Manning were finally able to beat the Patriots and their quarterback Tom Brady in the AFC Championship Game on their way to a victory in Super Bowl XLI against the Chicago Bears. Manning was named the Super Bowl MVP. The Colts and Manning would continue to have success, with Manning winning two further MVP awards in 2008 and 2009. In 2009 the Colts would return to the Super Bowl where they would lose to the New Orleans Saints. Peyton Manning holds the record for the most starts as the Colts quarterback, as well as the most wins. Manning has also set franchise records in completions, passing attempts, completion percentage, passing yards, touchdowns and has the highest franchise passer rating while Johnny Unitas holds the record for most interceptions by a Colts quarterback. Manning has taken the most sacks of all the quarterbacks but Bert Jones has lost the most yards while being sacked. Jones also has the record for the longest completed pass by a Colts starting quarterback, with a 90-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Roger Carr in a home win against the New York Jets in 1975.",Normal
"Kingmaker is the eighth studio album by Canadian-New Zealand country singer Tami Neilson, released in July 2022. The album debuted at number one on the Official New Zealand Music Chart. Neilson was disheartened after the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand stalled the promotion of her previous album Chickaboom! (2020), and was uninspired to write music in 2020. Writing for Kingmaker began in early 2021, and took six months. The album was primarily inspired by Neilson's experiences as an Indigenous woman in the music industry, and she wanted to write an album that had a ""cinematic arc"", similar to a film soundtrack. Sonically, the album was inspired by Nancy & Lee (1968) and the subsequent music released by Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood, as well as musicians Ennio Morricone and Bobbie Gentry. The song ""Beyond the Stars"" was written together with Delaney Davidson, with both musicians expressing mourning for their fathers. Neilson was scheduled to perform at the Luck Reunion festival in Texas in March 2020, however the festival was cancelled and a livestream was released in its place. American country musician Willie Nelson and his family were watching the concert, which led to Neilson developing a friendship with Nelson's wife Annie D'Angelo, and led to Nelson being a featured vocalist on the song. The album was recorded in a week at Neil Finn's Roundhead Studios in Auckland. The first single released from the album was ""Beyond the Stars"", featuring American country musician Willie Nelson in April 2022. This was followed by ""Baby You're a Gun"" in May, ""Careless Woman"" in June and ""Kingmaker"" in July. At the 2022 Aotearoa Music Awards, won the awards for Best Country Artist, Best Solo Artist and Best Producer for her work on Kingmaker. 2022 was the sixth time Neilson had won the Best Country Artist award, and Neilson's Best Producer award was the first time the award had been given to a woman since Bic Runga won the award in 2006 for her album Birds (2005). The album was longlisted for the 2023 Polaris Music Prize.",Normal
"Matthew Curling Friend (1792–1871) was an Australian inventor and public servant. He was the son of John Friend of Ramsgate and Mary Curling of the Isle of Thanet. He joined the Royal Navy as a Midshipman in July 1806 and was promoted to Lieutenant in February 1815. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars he was put on half pay. Friend then pursued scientific interests and was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1820. He subsequently entered Cambridge in 1822 and married Mary Anne Ford in 1826. Like many other officers on half-pay, Friend was obliged to seek his living in the colonies to support his wife and growing family in respectable circumstances. In 1829 Friend sailed with his family as captain of Wanstead. The wife and daughters of Edward Davy Wedge were on board, ultimately resulting in the marriage of Thomas Wedge with daughter Anna Maria Friend. With his wife he stayed at the Swan River Colony from 30 January 1830 until 19 March, before leaving for Tasmania. While at the Swan River he collected mammal and bird specimens. Wanstead arrived in Hobart Town in April 1830. He presented his collection of specimens of flora and fauna from the Australian continent at the Zoological Society in England during 1831. Friend was a member of the Royal Society of London. Friend arrived back in Van Diemen’s Land in 1832 with other members of his family, this time on the Norval. Friend was appointed Port Officer in Launceston in 1832 and also engaged in pastoral pursuits. Friend was involved in controversy relating to his appointment as Port Officer, and eventually won a libel action. Friend was also at the centre of cultural and scientific life in the colony. He lectured on natural history, helped organise the first Tamar Regatta in 1830, and assisted greatly with the Launceston Horticultural Society and the local committee of the Hobart Town Launceston and Port Phillip Steam Ship Company. Ill health and increasing blindness forced him to resign in 1852, and he and his second wife returned to England, where he died at Clevedon, Somerset, in October 1871. During his last years he continued his interest in nautical science, inventing an indicator compass and the pelorus for measuring the local magnetism in iron ships.",Normal
"David Bartlett Rees (8 May 1936 – 22 May 1993) was an English author, lecturer and reviewer, known especially for children's and young adult fiction. For The Exeter Blitz he won the 1978 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. David Rees was born in Surbiton in 1936. He attended King's College School, Wimbledon, and Queens' College, Cambridge, where he attained a BA in 1958 and an MA in 1961. He worked as a school teacher before becoming a lecturer at St. Luke's College, Exeter, in 1968. Ten years later he became lecturer in education when the college became a part of the University of Exeter. He remained at the University until 1984, when he began to write full-time. In 1986 he founded the publishing company Third House with fellow writer Peter Robins. His autobiography, Not For Your Hands, was published in 1992. Rees died in London, 22 May 1993. He was afflicted with HIVAIDS and had once said, ""I've nothing left to write about and it's Aids as much as anything that has done that,"" but he did not stop writing until 1992. Much of his work can be classed as young adult fiction. Some of his fiction was contemporary, some historical, with settings including Devon and Ireland. Quintin's Man (1976) and In the Tent (1979) were the first teen books in the UK to have gay central characters. The Milkman's on his Way (1982) was cited in the House of Lords for promoting homosexuality, in 1999 debate on Section 28. Baroness Knight of Collingtree said that it ""explicitly described homosexual intercourse and, indeed, glorified it, encouraging youngsters to believe that it was better than any other sexual way of life."" Rees published two collections of essays on contemporary writers of fiction for children and young adults: The Marble in the Water (1980) and Painted Desert, Green Shade (1984).",Normal
"Doomdark's Revenge is a role-playing and wargame video game developed by Mike Singleton and published by Beyond Software for the ZX Spectrum in 1984. It is a sequel to Singleton's 1984 seminal The Lords of Midnight and has similar game mechanics but adds more detail and complexity with the number of characters and locations increased. In Doomdark's Revenge, the hero of the first game, Luxor the Moonprince, goes into the savage wastes of Icemark to rescue his son Morkin and defeat the evil Empress Shareth, daughter of his enemy Doomdark. Despite the title, Doomdark - who was killed in the first game - does not return in the sequel. Like its predecessor, Doomdark's Revenge was a major critical success and a commercial hit. Ports to the Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64 were released in 1986. It was supposed to be followed by a sequel titled The Eye of the Moon in 1989, which was never finished. Another sequel, Lords of Midnight: The Citadel, was eventually released in 1995. A remake of Doomdark's Revenge was released in February 2014. Luxor's Moonring allows the player to view the world through the eyes of any character that is already in alliance or who has been recruited to Luxor's cause and, in each game day, the player may select characters in turn and move them around the Icemark, seeking objects, allies or enemies. The game has five factions to be recruited or fought: the Fey, Barbarians, Dwarfs, Giants, and Icelords. The main difference between Revenge and The Lords of Midnight is that the lords now all move and react independently, no longer content to sit in their castles and wait to be recruited. The enemy leader, Shareth, also moves around, attempting to recruit armies and lords to her cause, so a major part of the game involves recruiting sufficient forces to counter hers. This makes the relationship between lords very important, as some are vassals of others, and may only be recruited by their lieges. Recruiting a liege does not automatically recruit all his vassals, nor their respective vassals but it offers additional armed strength as well as access to the Lord's city or fortress. Lords may also cooperate, recruit and fight each other independently, making the world much more dynamic than the previous game. Hostile fortresses or cities may be sacked and taken ownership of, which become important sources of manpower as they slowly generate troops that can be used to replace those lost in battle elsewhere. The Icemark is a varied environment with forests, mountain ranges, plains and hills, all of which offer some resistance to the distance which may be travelled in each game 'day'. The land also features pits, palaces, huts, temples, gates and fountains which may contain creatures or magic that harms the player or provides respite and refreshment. These features may also provide access to the underground tunnel world beneath the Icemark which would otherwise inaccessible. Within the Icemark, there are many magic items to be found, most belonging to a single lord and having 'power in battle'. Also, there are useful objects in the form of magic crowns, which may aid in the task of recruiting Lords. Runes may provide protection or the ability to be swifter in travel; in some cases, these objects may summon enemies or allow travel to a particular location. Doomdark's Revenge reverses the first game's victory conditions by giving the computer only a single goal, the death of the main protagonist Luxor. The player has many possible levels of victory, ranging from the simple rescue of Luxor's son Morkin from Shareth's spell of enchantment and retreat to Midnight, to the complete destruction of Shareth and the safe return home of Luxor, Morkin, as well as Luxor's companions Rorthron and Tarithel. After Doomdark the Witchking was destroyed in the first game, word reaches his daughter, Shareth the Heartstealer, the dreaded Empress of the Frozen Empire of Icemark who is as evil as she is beautiful and powerful. Enraged by the news, she decides to take revenge on the chief architect of her father's downfall, Luxor the Moonprince, by bewitching and kidnapping his son Morkin. The game revolves around Luxor and his companions Rorthron the Wise and Morkin's beloved Tarithel the Fey, and their attempts to rescue Morkin and defeat Shareth. Canonically, Tarithel found Morkin and broke Shareth's spell with a single kiss. Shareth's armies have been defeated and she herself has been slain in the great final battle. However, Shareth's and Morkin's union has created a son named Anderlane, who was later born from a surrogate mother. The game's publisher Beyond Software offered a prize - models of the major characters in an Icemark setting - to the first player who revealed the ""Watchwords of Midnight"", an inscription on Luxor's Moon Ring that would be shown upon ultimate victory. The conditions for this to happen was if the player could bring all the major characters including Morkin to the Gate of Varenorn and eliminate Shareth. The first to do so was then-15-year-old Richard Harris from Lowestoft in November 1984. Harris, however, had to wait for the models for 14 months - until January 1986 - because the publisher had not expected anyone to ""finish the game so quickly"". Doomdark's Revenge was adapted into a Fighting Fantasy-style gamebook type game by Beyond Software's Clive Bailey and Terry Pratt that was serialized in three parts in Computer and Video Games magazine. The first part, published in the December 1984 issue, follows Luxor to the Frozen Gates that lead into Icemark. In the second part, Tarithel makes her way through Icemark to the pit of Alazorne, where Morkin is held captive. In the final part, the freed Morkin sets on his own quest to find and kill the evil Shareth. A novelisation of Doomdark's Revenge by Drew Wagar was published in December 2021. Doomdark's Revenge was very well received by game critics and public alike. Amstrad Action gave it a review score of 95%, making it their ninth best game of all time. In 1993, readers of Your Sinclair voted it the 71st best game of all time. Originally the series was conceived as a trilogy, with the third part titled The Eye of the Moon. The sequel is even mentioned in the game's manual: ""The third part of the trilogy, possibly the most exciting yet, is still to come, when Mike will send Morkin down to the warmer lands which lie below Midnight itself, to find the Eye of the Moon"". The Eye of the Moon was to be a magical crystal, or jewel, that allowed its owner to look into the future. According to Singleton: ""Luxor is dying, it's some years on and he's reached the end of his tether, and he wants to see what is going to happen to Midnight in the future. So Morkin goes off in search of the magical jewel called the Eye of the Moon which enables people to see into the future, so that Luxor can then rest in peace"". Some of Singleton's plans included a game canvas four times bigger than the original Lords of Midnight, divided into twelve kingdoms set south-west of the original game, dynamic full-color graphics with black masking to hide any color clashes, unique graphics for all castles, unique, generated, full-scale facial graphics for all characters, a more convincing name generator, interior scenes of keeps and citadels, et cetera. There were even tentative plans to implement a multiplayer mode, using the already existing micear sockets to exchange data. Despite having already created a substantial amount of new game code, Singleton was involved in numerous other game projects at the time and thus put the game on hiatus. In an article published in July 1985 in Computer Gamer, Singleton disclosed quite a lot of details of the game. The game was to have 16,000 locations and 131,000 unique views, created with a new technique called Randscaping. The Randscaping engine made every view unique. In multiplayer mode, the two players would each control either Morkin or Tarithel on their quest to find the fabled jewel. His new Midnight Identikit could create personalized faces for all the 256 NPCs roaming the canvas. Some of the NPCs were to have unique capabilities; for instance, one character would have the magic ability to flatten mountains, and was to be a critical recruitment for one of the mini-quests, allowing the player access beyond an impassable mountain range to retrieve an item. Another NPC could control the weather, and so on. At the start of the game, the player(s) would only be able to control Morkin and Tarithel, recruiting more characters to their cause as the game progresses. The recruited characters could be made part of teams headed by a character chosen by the player, making moving the characters around the playing field a lot easier. The last attempt by Singleton to get the game released was in April 1989. Today there exists no authentic material for The Eye of the Moon. Some presentation mock-ups were created by Singleton; all still available screenshots—if any—are from these faked mock-ups. While the most serious intention of both Singleton and publisher Domark indeed was to create this third part, the sequel was later indefinitely shelved, partly due to Mike Singleton's other commitments and partly due to the original publisher being bought out by Telecomsoft. Because of this, the new management wanted to change the terms of agreement, demanding two distinct versions of the game - 8-bit and 16-bit versions - instead of one. Singleton refused the new agreement. The Eye of the Moon has since been mentioned for a possible upcoming release. With Mike Singleton again involved, a significant amount of work had already taken place. However, with the death of creator Singleton, all developments on the possible sequel have ceased, with the consensus that ""it shall always remain a myth or a legend"". Doomdark's Revenge would, however, be followed many years later by another sequel, Lords of Midnight: The Citadel.",Normal
"Frobot is a puzzleshooting video game developed and published by American studio Fugazo for WiiWare as well as Windows. The word ""Frobot"" is a portmanteau of ""afro"" and ""robot."" The WiiWare version was released in North America on December 20, 2010 and the PC version was released on January 13, 2011. A European version of the game was planned for WiiWare, but never released due to the shutdown of the WiiWare channel on January 30, 2019. Players control the titular Frobot, a masculine robot who sports an afro and is equipped for combat. Frobot must rescue his five robot girlfriends from their demise upon their kidnapping. Gameplay involves solving puzzles and battling robots to navigate Frobot through levels set in a top-down perspective. In multiplayer mode, up to four players may fight one another as armed robots. In single-player mode, the player controls Frobot through different kinds of scenarios while confronting enemies and solving different kinds of puzzles. The game features five different types of environments, different kinds of weapons (such as energy blasts, missiles, etc.) and boss fights. As Frobot rescues his girlfriends he regains all of his powers: remote mines, quick dash, missiles, shield, and a disco ball. Frobot has one competitive multiplayer mode that lets four players battle each other using an assortment of weapons such as energy blasts, mines, missiles, and grenades. The game has 10 different maps with present special features such as destructible walls, moving platforms, and teleporters. According to the developer, the gameplay could perhaps be summarized if one ""imagine if Wii Tanks and The Legend of Zelda had a baby. The baby's name would be Frobot.""

"William Orville ""Lefty"" Frizzell (March 31, 1928 – July 19, 1975) was an American country and honky-tonk singer-songwriter. Frizell is known as one of the most influential country music vocal stylists of all time. He has been cited as influencing prominent country singers like George Jones, Merle Haggard, and Willie Nelson. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1982 as well as the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In his prime, Frizzell was the first artist to achieve four songs in the top ten on the Country Music Billboard charts at one time. Frizzell went on to have more success, releasing many songs that charted in the Top 10 of the Hot Country Songs charts as an artist and songwriter. After dealing with alcoholism, he died of a stroke at age 47. William Orville Frizzell was born the son of an oilman, the first of eight children, in Corsicana in Navarro County in North Texas, United States. During his childhood, his family moved to El Dorado in Union County in south Arkansas. As a child he was called ""Sonny,"" but he later took the name ""Lefty."" It was believed that he got the name ""Lefty"" because he had won a neighborhood fight; however, this tale was a part of a fake publicity stunt set up by his record label. Frizzell's largest influences included ""The Blue Yodeler"" Jimmie Rodgers. He began listening to Rodgers' records as a boy. He began singing professionally before his teens, even earning a spot on the local radio-station KELD in El Dorado, Arkansas. Frizzell's teens were spent singing in nightclubs and radio and talent shows throughout the south. During his tour of Arkansas, Texas, New Mexico, and Las Vegas, he began to develop a style of his own, shaped by artists like Rodgers, Ernest Tubb, and Ted Daffan. While living in Greenville, Texas, during World War II, Frizzell performed on radio station KPLT in nearby Paris, Texas. There he met Alice Harper; they married in March 1945. In 1946, they moved to Roswell, New Mexico, and Frizzell performed on radio station KGFL and with the house band at the Cactus Gardens dance hall. In July 1947, the 19-year-old Frizzell was arrested and jailed for having sex with an underage fan. He was charged with statutory rape, convicted the following month, and served six months in the county jail. Filled with guilt, he wrote poems to his wife from his cell; one of them would become his first big record. After his release in late 1949, he was led away from music, and back to the oil fields to work with his father. However, soon he was performing in nightclubs again. By 1950, he had landed a regular job at the Big Spring, Texas, nightclub ""Ace of Clubs"" where he developed a dedicated fan following. During a show at the ""Ace of Clubs"", Jim Beck, the owner of a Dallas recording studio, took notice of Frizzell. Beck had deals with several major record producing labels and maintained connections with many publishers. Impressed with Frizzell's performance, he invited him to make a free demo at the studio. In April 1950, he cut several demos of Frizzell singing his own songs, including ""If You've Got the Money (I've Got the Time),"" which Beck took to Nashville where he pitched it to Little Jimmy Dickens, who disliked the song. However, Columbia Records producer Don Law heard the cut and liked it. After hearing Lefty in concert, he signed the singer and recorded him for the first time. ""If You've Got the Money (I've Got the Time)"" became a two-sided smash hit in 1950 upon its release; the b-side was the song Frizzell wrote to his grief-stricken wife Alice from jail, ""I Love You A Thousand Ways."" These songs launched him into stardom and within two years, he had gone to register 13 Top 10 Country hits. By 1951, he had perfected his vocal style and refined his guitar skills. He began working with a core group of Dallas-based studio musicians, including pianist Madge Suttee. In January 1951 he signed a contract that designated Jack Starnes Jr. as his manager. That contract conflicted with another contract Frizzell had signed, leading Starnes to file a major lawsuit against Frizzell, which was settled out of court a year later. Also in early 1951, Frizzell formed the Western Cherokees, led by Blackie Crawford, and soon they became his primary band for both live and recording sessions. During this stage of his career, he was in the studio extensively, recording singles. His third single, ""I Want to Be With You Always"", was No. 1 for 11 weeks in 1951. By mid-1951, Frizzell had become one of the only country singers who could be considered to match the popularity of Hank Williams, and he even toured with Williams. ""There is enough stories in that tour to fill a book..."" Frizzell once said, although he never told those stories. He had three more Top 10 hits in 1951; ""Mom and Dad's Waltz,"" ""Travelin' Blues,"" and the #1 hit ""Give Me More, More, More (Of Your Kisses)."" In August 1951, he was arrested backstage at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee and charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor; the charge stemmed from a liaison in Arkansas during his tour with Williams. The charges were dropped and Frizzell was never prosecuted. By 1952, he was a popular stage performer and in heavy demand, being included on The Grand Ole Opry and The Louisiana Hayride multiple times throughout the 1950s. The hits continued throughout 1952, with ""How Long Will It Take (To Stop Loving You),"" ""Don't Stay Away ('Till Love Grows Cold)"", ""Forever (And Always)"", and ""I'm An Old, Old Man (Try'n'a Live While I Can)"". Despite his massive success, things began to go downhill for Frizzell. He fired his manager and band, and joined the Grand Ole Opry; however, he quit very soon thereafter. Even though he was earning a lot of money, he was spending almost all of it. He began to work with the Arkansas-born singer-songwriter Wayne Raney, but the sessions were considered a failure. Frizell had an automobile accident in 1952, moved to Los Angeles in early 1953, and earned a spot as a regular cast member on the Town Hall Party television show on KTTV. His songs still charted, but only one entered the Top 10 that year In January 1954, Frizzell had another automobile accident, near E.S. Richardson Elementary School in Minden in Webster Parish, Louisiana, through which he passed after leaving the Louisiana Hayride in Shreveport en route to a concert in Mississippi. His Cadillac struck the Nash station wagon parked at the home of its owner, R. Harmon Drew, Sr., the former city judge and later a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives. Frizzell apologized, said that he hoped to visit Minden again under more favorable circumstances, posted bond, and took a taxicab back to Shreveport, from which he flew to his destination. In early 1954, he reached the Top 10 for the last time for five years. Having had few hits in the middle-late 1950s, he felt burnt out and had little energy for his career. He became frustrated that Columbia Records did not release what he thought to be his best material, so he stopped writing and recording songs. He toured extensively, however. In 1959, deciding on change, Frizell began to work at Nashville's Cedarwood Publishing Company with Jim Denny. His first Top 10 hit in five years came with ""Long Black Veil"" that year. He moved to Nashville in 1960 after the Town Hall Party closed, and began touring and recording more and more, scoring some minor hits. Lefty's last big hit came in 1964 with the No. 1 song ""Saginaw, Michigan"", which earned him a Grammy nomination. The next year, ""She's Gone, Gone, Gone"" was his last Top 20 hit. However, I Never Go Around Mirrors from his last studio album The Legendary is considered one of the greatest country songs of all time. So much so that it has been recorded over 22 times since with Keith Whitley's version standing out as one of the very best covers of the song. Frizzell began a downward spiral after developing a debilitating alcohol problem. Despite his history of infidelity, arrests for sex with underage fans, contractual legal troubles, and automobile accidents, Alice Harper remained his wife, and their marriage produced three children. During the late 1960s he recorded many songs, but Columbia released very few. Because of his declining record sales, he began to perform less. In 1968, he recorded with June Stearns as Agnes and Orville. In early 1972, Frizzell left Columbia Records and signed with ABC Records. That same year, he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and his song ""If You've Got the Money (I've Got the Time)"" earned him the Grammy Hall of Fame Award. By this time, drinking was taking a toll on him. He had developed chronic hypertension, his appearance had changed drastically, and his voice had deteriorated. On July 19, 1975, at age 47, Frizzell died of a massive stroke, and was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Gardens in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. Frizzell was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in October 1982. Frizzell's signature guitar was a 1949 Gibson J-200 (Model SJ-200). Originally built by the Gibson Guitar Corporation, it was retrofitted in early 1951 with a custom neck and pickguard by guitar maker and innovator Paul Bigsby. In a 2003 interview Merle Haggard recalled, ""When I was a teenager, Lefty got me onstage  and handed me that guitar. That is the first guitar I played on a professional stage."" For many years, the guitar had been on loan to and displayed at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, Tennessee. In January 2005, it was returned to the Frizzell family and was later sold via auction by Retrofret, with an asking price of $350,000; Haggard purchased the guitar and it remains a part of his estate. Frizzell's style of singing influenced a great many singers, particularly Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, George Jones, Keith Whitley, and Roy Orbison. In addition, he was widely recognized for his songwriting talents. In the foreword to a biography of Frizzell by his younger brother David Frizzell, Merle Haggard said, ""The impact Lefty had on country music is not even measurable. ... No one could handle a song like Lefty. He would hold on to each word until he finally decided to drop it and pick up the next one. Most of us learned to sing listening to him."" Stoney Edwards recorded ""Hank and Lefty Raised My Country Soul,"" a tribute to Hank Williams and Frizzell, written by Dallas Frazier. It hit the Top 40 in 1973. George Strait recorded a Sanger D. Shafer song called ""Lefty's Gone"" on the album Something Special. In addition, Willie Nelson's 1977 album, To Lefty From Willie was a tribute to Frizzell and consisted entirely of cover versions of Frizzell songs. Frizzell was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1982 and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He is also in the Rockabilly Hall of Fame along with his son Crockett Frizzell. Frizzell ranked number 31 on CMT's 2003 40 Greatest Men of Country Music. Fellow Texan Roy Orbison was a devout fan of Frizzell's sound, and in 1988, as a part of the Traveling Wilburys, he chose the name ""Lefty Wilbury"" to honor his musical hero. Maine singer-songwriter David Mallett included Frizzell's ""Saginaw, Michigan"" on his 2014 album The Horse I Rode in On. His younger brother, David Frizzell, is also a country singer. His biggest hits were 1982's ""I'm Gonna Hire a Wino (To Decorate Our Home)"" and ""You're the Reason God Made Oklahoma"", a 1981 duet with Shelly West. The youngest brother, Allen Frizzell followed in his older brothers' footsteps in the country field. He was an opening performer for Dottie West. He was also married to Shelly West, daughter of Dottie West. Allen also played with Keith Whitley. He now plays country gospel music. In 2006, J.D. Crowe and The New South released the album Lefty's Old Guitar. The song ""Lefty's Old Guitar"" was written about his custom Gibson J-200. Daryle Singletary referenced Frizzell in his song ""Ain't It The Truth"" on an album by the same name, released by Giant Records in 1998. In 2019, Frizzell's single ""Long Black Veil"" was selected by the U.S. Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".",Normal

"Air Canada Flight 797 was an international passenger flight operating from DallasFort Worth International Airport to Montréal–Dorval International Airport, with an intermediate stop at Toronto Pearson International Airport. On 2 June 1983, the McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 operating the service developed an in-flight fire in air around the rear lavatory that spread between the outer skin and the inner decor panels, filling the plane with toxic smoke. The spreading fire also burned through crucial electrical cables that disabled most of the instrumentation in the cockpit, forcing the plane to divert to CincinnatiNorthern Kentucky International Airport. Ninety seconds after the plane landed and the doors were opened, the heat of the fire and fresh oxygen from the open exit doors created flashover conditions, and the plane's interior immediately became engulfed in flames, killing 23 passengers—half of the people on board—who were unable to evacuate the aircraft. The accident became a watershed for global aviation regulations, which were changed in the aftermath of the accident to make aircraft safer. New requirements to install smoke detectors in lavatories, strip lights marking paths to exit doors, and increased firefighting training and equipment for crew became standard across the industry, while regulations regarding evacuation were also updated. Since the accident, it has become mandatory for aircraft manufacturers to prove their aircraft could be evacuated within 90 seconds of the commencement of an evacuation, and passengers seated in overwing exits are now instructed to assist in an emergency situation. At 16:25 Eastern Daylight Time on 2 June 1983, Flight 797 took off from DallasFort Worth International Airport. The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight operated by Air Canada using a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 (aircraft registration C-FTLU). The flight was scheduled to make a stop at Toronto International Airport, ultimately bound for Montreal's Dorval Airport.: 2 The flight's captain, Donald Cameron (age 51), had been employed by Air Canada since March 1966, and had qualified as a DC-9 captain in November 1974. At the time of the accident, Cameron had approximately 13,000 flight hours, of which 4,939 were in the DC-9. First Officer Claude Ouimet (age 34) had flown for Air Canada since November 1973. He had about 5,650 hours of flight experience, including 2,499 hours in the DC-9, and had qualified as a DC-9 first officer in February 1979.: 80 While the flight was over Louisville, Kentucky, a fire started in or around the rear lavatory of the aircraft. The pilots heard a popping sound around 18:51 EDT, during dinner service, and discovered that the lavatory's circuit breakers had tripped. Captain Cameron's initial attempt to reset the circuit breakers was unsuccessful.: 2 It was not uncommon for a plane's lavatory circuits to pop occasionally, precipitated by a large number of passengers using the toilet after eating, so Cameron waited around eight minutes to give the tripped circuits time to cool down before attempting to reset them again at 18:59. The captain observed that the circuit breakers popped back out as he pushed them to reset.: 2 At about 19:00, a passenger seated in the last row informed flight attendant Judi Davidson of a strange odour in the rear of the airplane. Davidson traced the odour to the aft lavatory. Davidson attempted to check on the lavatory by opening the door a few inches. At that time she observed the lavatory full of light grey smoke, but did not see flames. Davidson asked flight attendant Laura Kayama to find chief flight attendant Sergio Benetti, who entered the lavatory to investigate.: 2 Benetti saw no flames, but did see curls of thick black smoke coming out from the seams around the walls of the lavatory. While Benetti sprayed the interior of the lavatory with a CO2 fire extinguisher, Kayama moved passengers on the sparsely-populated flight forward, and opened air vents to let more fresh air into the cabin. Kayama also went to the cockpit, and at 19:02, informed the flight crew of a ""fire in the washroom"". Captain Cameron put on his oxygen mask and ordered First Officer Ouimet to go back and investigate.: 2 Ouimet found that thick smoke was filling the last three to four rows of seats, and he could not reach the aft lavatory. Benetti informed Ouimet that he did not see the source of the fire, but had doused the lavatory with fire retardant. Benetti told Ouimet that he did not believe the fire was in the trash bin.: 3 At 19:04, Ouimet returned to the cockpit, told Cameron about the smoke, and suggested descending. However, Ouimet did not report Benetti's comment that the fire was not a mere trash bin fire. A few seconds later, Benetti came to the cockpit and told the captain that passengers were moved forward and that the smoke was ""easing up."" Cameron sent Ouimet back to try inspecting the aft lavatory again.: 3 At 19:06, while Ouimet was out of the cockpit, Benetti again told Cameron that he thought the smoke was clearing. The captain, still believing the fire was in the lavatory trash bin, had not started descending because he expected the fire would be put out.: 3 Shortly after, the ""master caution"" light in the cockpit illuminated, indicating a loss of main bus electrical power. The captain called the air traffic controller (ATC) in Indianapolis, Indiana, and notified them that Flight 797 had an ""electrical problem."" Flight 797's transponder signal then disappeared from ATC radar displays; ATC was able to monitor the flight by switching to primary radar tracking.: 4 At 19:07, Ouimet reached the aft lavatory again. He reached to open the door, but because it felt hot to the touch, he decided not to open it. Ouimet directed the flight attendants to keep the lavatory door closed, then returned to the cockpit, where he told Cameron, ""I don't like what's happening, I think we better go down, okay?"" Cameron detected urgency in Ouimet's voice, which he took to mean an immediate descent was needed.: 3 Just after Ouimet returned to the cockpit, the cockpit ""master warning"" light lit up, warning the pilots of a loss of emergency electrical power. Cameron ordered Ouimet to switch to battery power, but the loss of main and emergency electrical power caused some electrical systems to fail, including power for the horizontal stabilizer. This caused the stabilizer to be stuck in the cruising position.: 4 This made controlling the plane's descent extremely difficult and required great physical exertion from the pilot and first officer. In addition, both flight recorders stopped recording at this point.: 13–14 At 19:08, Captain Cameron began an emergency descent and declared ""mayday, mayday, mayday"" to Indianapolis ATC. Controllers granted Flight 797 clearance to descend for an emergency landing at CincinnatiNorthern Kentucky International Airport in Boone County, Kentucky, near Cincinnati, Ohio.: 4 Because the loss of electrical power had impaired some flight instruments, controllers had to direct Flight 797 to the airport using a ""no gyro"" approach, with the controller observing Flight 797 on radar and directing the flight to make turns based on radar position and heading.: 5 Smoke filled the passenger cabin and entered the cockpit as the plane descended.: 7 The PA system also failed, leaving the flight attendants unable to communicate efficiently with the passengers. Nevertheless, attendants were able to move all passengers forward of row 13, and to instruct passengers sitting in exit rows on how to open the doors,: 8 a practice that was not standard on commercial airline flights at the time. At 19:20, Captain Cameron and First Officer Ouimet executed an extremely difficult landing at CincinnatiNorthern Kentucky International Airport. Four tires blew out during the landing. Once the plane came to a stop, chief flight attendant Sergio Benetti opened the front door of the aircraft, through which he escaped. The pilots quickly shut the airplane down. The overwing and forward aircraft doors were opened, and slides at the front doors were deployed. The three flight attendants and 18 of the passengers evacuated using these exits.: 8 Opening the doors also caused an influx of air that fuelled the fire. The pilots were unable to enter the passenger cabin because of the smoke and heat.: 8 Ouimet escaped through the right emergency window shortly after the plane landed, but Cameron, who was exhausted from trying to keep the plane under control, was unable to move and barely conscious. Firefighters doused Cameron in firefighting foam through the right window, shocking him back to awareness. Cameron was then able to open the left emergency escape window and drop to the ground, where Ouimet dragged him to safety. Cameron was the last person to escape the plane. Less than 90 seconds after touchdown, the interior of the plane flashed over and ignited, killing the remaining 23 passengers on board, who died from smoke inhalation and burns from the flash fire. Of the 18 surviving passengers, three received serious injuries, 13 received minor injuries and two were uninjured. None of the five crew members sustained any injuries.: 8 Survivor Dianne Fadley remarked: ""It was almost like anybody who got out had nothing wrong... You made it and you were completely fine, or you didn't make it."" The fire completely destroyed the aircraft.: 9 Twenty-one Canadians and two Americans died. Many of the victims' bodies were burned beyond recognition. Almost all of the victims were in the forward half of the aircraft between the wings and the cockpit. Some victims were found in the aisle, while others were still in their seats. Two victims were found in the rear of the aircraft even though all passengers had been moved forward after the fire had been detected; these two victims were likely disoriented in the confusion that ensued upon landing and evacuation. Blood samples from the bodies revealed high levels of cyanide, fluoride and carbon monoxide, chemicals produced by the burning plane.: 13–28 Because the accident occurred in the United States, it was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Although the fuselage was nearly destroyed by the intensity of the fire, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) were still in good condition and produced vital data for the NTSB investigation. On the CVR, NTSB investigators heard eight sounds of electrical arcing beginning at 18:48. The arcing sounds repeated each time that the crew tried to reset the lavatory circuit breakers. Both pilots testified that they did not hear any arcing, and the NTSB concluded that these sounds would be inaudible to the flight crew.: 59 Although a number of wires in the lavatory section were later found with insulation stripped away, NTSB investigators were unable to determine whether this insulation damage was the cause of the fire or was caused by the fire.: 57 This particular DC-9 had experienced a number of problems over the months leading up to the incident; 76 maintenance reports had been filed in the plane's logs in the previous year, and the CVR recorded Captain Cameron telling First Officer Ouimet to ""put  in the book there"" when the breakers failed to respond to the first reset attempt at 18:52. Cameron attempted once more to reset the breakers at 18:59. The CVR recorded arcing sounds followed by the popping sound of the breakers continuing to trip again after each reset over the next 60 seconds. On 17 September 1979, the plane, then serving as Air Canada Flight 680 from Boston, Massachusetts, to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, had suffered an explosive decompression in the rear bulkhead that required rebuilding the tail section and replacing or splicing most of the wiring and hydraulic lines in the back of the plane. Cameron later noted that the Air Canada maintenance crew ""did a heck of a job getting everything put back together"" after the decompression incident. Investigators were unable to find signs of arcing in any of the wire splices from the repairs done four years earlier, though much of the wiring in the rear of the plane was severely damaged or destroyed by the fire itself. The NTSB was ultimately unable to determine the origin of the fire. In August 1984, the NTSB issued a final report that concluded that the probable causes were a fire of undetermined origin, the flight crew's underestimation of the fire's severity and conflicting fire-progress information given to the captain. This report also found that the flight crew's ""delayed decision to institute an emergency descent"" contributed to the severity of the accident.: 71 Captain Cameron later said: All I know was that I did the best I could, I'm very sorry the people that didn't get off, didn't get off, because we spent a lot of time and effort getting them there. After the NTSB issued its report, a number of commercial pilots and airline personnel petitioned the NTSB to revise its report. In addition, First Officer Ouimet sent the NTSB a detailed defence of the crew's actions, including the decision to land in Cincinnati instead of at Standiford Field Airport in Louisville, Kentucky, the airport closest to Flight 797 when the crew first declared an emergency. Ouimet stated that Louisville was too close to be able to descend from cruising altitude to an emergency landing safely, and even landing in Cincinnati was a questionable proposition given Cameron's difficulties in controlling the plane. In January 1986, after reviewing Ouimet's missive and reevaluating the available data, the NTSB issued a revised version of its accident report. The revised report included Ouimet's explanation of the landing decision. The report was still critical of Cameron's decision not to inquire about the fire itself. However, in its revised report, the NTSB revised its probable-cause finding to describe the fire reports given to Cameron as ""misleading"" instead of merely ""conflicting"" information. The NTSB also removed the word ""delayed"" from its description of the pilots' decision to descend, instead listing the ""time taken to evaluate the nature of the fire and to decide to initiate an emergency descent"" as a contributing factor.: 71 The crew of Flight 797 were later honoured by multiple Canadian aviation organizations for their heroic actions in landing the plane safely. As a result of this accident and other incidents of in-flight fires on passenger aircraft, the NTSB issued several recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), including: Canadian folk singer Stan Rogers, 33, was killed by smoke inhalation. Rogers was known for songs such as ""Northwest Passage"", ""The Mary Ellen Carter"" and ""Barrett's Privateers."" He was returning home after attending the Kerrville Folk Festival in Texas. George Curtis Mathes Jr., the chairman of the board and public face of the Curtis Mathes Corporation, a maker of high-end home electronics, was also killed in this incident. After the incident, Air Canada sold the right wing of the DC-9 to Ozark Air Lines to repair an airplane damaged on 20 December 1983, when Ozark Flight 650, tail number N994Z, collided with a snowplow in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, killing the snowplow operator and separating the right wing from the aircraft. Air Canada used flight number 797 until 2022, although in its last years, it operated between Toronto Pearson International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. The Discovery Channel CanadaNational Geographic TV series Mayday (also titled Air Crash Investigation, Air Emergency and Air Disasters) featured the accident in a 2007 episode titled ""Fire Fight,"" which includes interviews with survivors and accident investigators as well as a dramatic recreation of the flight. It is featured in season 1, episode 4, of the TV show Why Planes Crash, in an episode called ""Fire in the Sky"".

"The ANARC-182 is a family of military aircraft radio transceivers designed for two-way, multi-mode voice communications over a 30 to 400 MHz frequency range. It covers both Ultra High Frequency (UHF) and Very High Frequency (VHF) bands with AM, FM, as appropriate. The ARC-182 radio supports the HAVE QUICK II anti-jam waveforms, with an optional control unit. It features a guard channel capability for monitoring 40.5, 121.5, 156.8 and 243MHz. Transmitter minimum power is 10 watts, AM, and 15 watts, FM. The RT-1250A model radio can communicate with other avionics over a MIL-STD-1553 data bus. Developed in the late 1970s, the ARC-182s were manufactured by Rockwell Collins and are installed in a range of U.S. Navy, Marines and Coast Guard aircraft. Its frequency range includes the following bands: A single ARC-182 radio allowed pilots to communicate with ground forces for close air support, civilian air traffic control and military UHF-AM users, a unique capability at the time. The ARC-182 (V) version added the ability to communicate with commercial shipping and UHF-FM systems. The -182(V) version added VHF-FM maritime and UHF-FM capabilities. The radio's utility has attracted international attention; the set is being used in 35 countries. Channel spacing is 25kHz in all bands. The transceiver weights about 10lb (4.54kg). Available accessories include remote controls, transmit power amplifiers, antennas, and ground support equipment. It has been largely replaced by the ANARC-210 series in U.S. systems. The ARC-210 is an improved version of the ARC-182, adding jam-reisistant SINCGARS capability to communicate with Army radios for close air support. The ARC-182 was used in over 40 different U.S. fixed wing and rotary aircraft, as well as in ground, transportable and mobile applications, and was in service in 42 countries. Starting in 1994, the ARC-182, along with the UHF-only ARC-187, was used to upgrade the U.S Navy's fleet of Lockheed P-3 Orions to add satellite and HaveQuick capabilities and to meet newer civilian air traffic control requirements.",Normal

She was a Labor Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1997 to 2009, representing the district of Kurwongbah. Lavarch was first elected to the seat of Kurwongbah, situated in Brisbane's northern suburbs, in a by-election on 24 May 1997. On 28 July 2005, Lavarch was appointed Queensland's Attorney-General and Minister for Justice—the first woman to hold a substantive role as Attorney-General in Queensland (Joan Sheldon had held the role in an interim capacity for seven days in 1996). Prior to being appointed Attorney-General, she held the position of parliamentary secretary to the Minister for Energy and Aboriginal and Minister for Torres Strait Islander Policy, John Mickel.

"Kalman Juvelier (Yiddish: קלמן יאָװעליר, 1863-1939) was an Austrian-born Yiddish theatre actor and manager, Broder singer, Tenor, and recording artist of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, who was active both in Europe and the United States. After emigrating to the United States in 1900, he became a key figure in the Yiddish theatre in New York, working with such notables as Boris Thomashefsky, David Kessler, Bertha Kalich and Jacob P. Adler and was director of the Hebrew Actor's Union as well as the Jewish Theatrical Alliance. From roughly 1905 to 1918, he recorded roughly 90 Yiddish language discs, mostly Yiddish theatre music, for most of the major record labels in the New York area. Juvelier was born in Lemberg, Galicia, Austria-Hungary (today Lviv, Ukraine) on May 12, 1863. He was born into a poor family; his parents were Isaiah Juvelier and Yetta (née Berger). He trained as a choir singer under Cantor Baruch Shor at age 9, and then with Cantor Aharon-Sholem Shirman. By his teen years, Juvelier had left Lemberg and began to travel as an itinerant folk singer. He fell in with the Broder singer group, and toured Galicia, Romania and Bukovina with them, including with Velvel Zbarjer, but also with lesser-known figures such as Adolf Shrage, Efrim Broder, and Henech Linetsky. Their first properly ""theatrical"" performance took place in Cernauti in a production of Shmendrik. The troupe then heard that there was a Yiddish theatre production being prepared in Botoșani, and Juvelier left the troupe with Mendele Rotman, and they joined the Itzik-Mendel Bergman troupe. For a time he acted in Gimpel's Theatre in Lviv under Goldfaden's direction. In 1880 he returned to Cernauti and joined Moses Horowitz's troupe. While working as an actor there he met his first wife, Yetta Rauch, who was the prima donna of the troupe. Kalman soon took over direction of the troupe and they spent the next two decades touring, performing operettas and plays by Avram Goldfaden, Jacob Gordin, Joseph Lateiner and others in Bukovina, Galicia, the Romania, Egypt, and the Ottoman Empire. In the 1890s his troupe continued to tour successfully and featured such actors as Bertha Kalich, Yekutiel ""Edward"" Margules, and Malbina Treitler, as well as a whole generation of younger Yiddish actors. Herman Wohl, who would later become a well-known composer of Yiddish music in the United States, also wrote for Juvelier's troupe during this time, as did the Hazzan and Yiddish songwriter Zeydl Helman. In some cases, Juvelier's troupe performed ""bootleg"" versions of Goldfaden plays, as in 1895 in Iași where he was able to find someone who had seen and memorized most of The Sacrifice of Isaac and could write it down for Juvelier. Goldfaden found out and attempted to sue Juvelier, but lost because the play was based on a Biblical story. His performance of a Yiddish adaptation of The Gypsy Baron was particularly successful, with Kalish coming to the attention of elite circles in Bucharest after its performance there. In 1899 or 1900 Juvelier emigrated to New York City along with his entire troupe, sailing from Hamburg. Among those who accompanied him for the journey were his entire family, and so many leading members of his troupe that it caused complaints from the Jewish actor's union in New York. In fact, he had been recruited to be a star at the Windsor Theatre, on behalf of his old troupe-leader Professor Horowitz; he ended up working there for five years. He soon become one of the most well-known leading men in the New York Yiddish theatre. He also managed to turn his fame on stage into a fairly extensive recording career, making him a contemporary of such early Yiddish recording artists as Solomon Smulewitz, Frank Seiden and Simon Paskal. His earliest may have been in 1904 when he made a number of recordings for the short-lived United Hebrew Disc and Cylinder Company, including some with Regina Prager. He became a Naturalized citizen in 1906. And by 1907 he was making recordings from Yiddish musicals and operettas by such composers as Goldfaden, Louis Friedsell, and Herman Wohl for Edison Records. By 1910 he had moved on to recording for Zonophone Records, and Columbia Records in 1912. In the early 1910s he worked at the Liberty Theatre with Boris Thomashefsky, until 1913 when he left on a tour of Argentina. In 1913 and again in 1915 he re-entered the studio with the Victor Recording Company in New York, recording a number of solo tracks and some with Fannie Lubritsky. His troupe with Yiddish theatre actress Regina Prager (the Prager-Juvelier Operetta Company), which had been founded sometime before 1907, embarked on a number of successful tours around the United States during the 1910s. During that time he returned to Columbia and Victor Records again several times, recording a long list of tracks for them during and after World War I. From 1921 to 1928, he worked in the Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia, and then returned to New York to work at the Second Avenue Theatre and others for a few short stints in the early 1930s. He retired from the stage in around 1935. He died at age 76, on December 15, 1939 in Brooklyn, New York. He was buried in Washington Cemetery. Kalman's children were mostly born in Europe with his first wife Yetta Rauch. She died in New York in 1908. Their children were Clara (born 1886), Max (born 1893), and Jennie (Bella, born 1904 in New York), who started off in the Yiddish and English theatre and later became a radio actor. He married his second wife Bina Abramovitz in 1910, a Russian-born Yiddish theatre actress.",Normal

"The first election for the South African Senate took place as a result of the creation of the Union of South Africa through the South Africa Act 1909. The Act included special provisions for the selection of the first elected Senators. The Union Parliament was prohibited from changing the arrangements for the Senate during its first ten years. The First Senate included eight Senators from each province. They were elected for a ten-year term by the members serving during the final session of the legislatures of each of the four colonies which joined the Union of South Africa. The election was by a form of the single transferable vote. The remaining eight seats were filled, by appointment (also for ten-year terms) by the Governor-General-in-Council (in effect by General Louis Botha's first Union government). Section 24 of the South Africa Act 1909 provided that, of the nominated Senators, One-half of their number shall be selected on the ground mainly of their thorough acquaintance, by reason of their official experience or otherwise, with the reasonable wants and wishes of the coloured races in South Africa. Casual vacancies in the representation of the provinces, in the First Senate only, were filled by an electoral college composed of the members of the relevant Provincial Council. New Senators, elected in this way, held the seat for the residue of the ten-year term. Nominated Senators, appointed to fill vacancies, received a ten-year term and did not have to vacate their seats at the end of the term for the provincial representatives. The composition, by party, of the provincial representatives in the First Senate included 18 representatives of the three colonial governing parties (six each from the South African Party of the Cape, Orangia Unie of the Orange River Colony and Het Volk of the Transvaal, all of which merged to form the South African Party on November 21, 1910), eight Independent Senators from Natal (which did not have a party system before the Union), and six Senators from the opposition parties (two each from the Unionist Party of the Cape, the Constitutional Party of Orange River Colony and the Progressive Party of Transvaal, all of which merged to form the Unionist Party on May 31, 1910).",Normal

"The kavkhan (Medieval Greek: καυχάνος; Bulgarian: кавха̀н) was one of the most important officials in the First Bulgarian Empire. According to the generally accepted opinion, he was the second most important person in the state after the Bulgarian ruler. He had a number of responsibilities and concentrated huge power and authority. The kavkhan was a commander-in-chief of the Bulgarian army and one of the primary diplomats in the state. He was a member of the 'Bolyar Counsel' and one of the most important advisers to the Bulgarian ruler; the kavkhan was sometimes his regent or co-ruler. The kavkhan was a high magistrate and substitute to the ruler when the latter is absent from the capital. He is also attributed to have been a judge. It is assumed that there was a prominent bolyar family in Bulgaria from which the kavkhan was chosen generation after generation - the so-called ""kavkhan kin"". The title was therefore hereditary and for life. According to most historians the title outlived the First Empire which was conquered by Basil II in 1018. The last person who had the prerogatives and responsibilities of a kavkhan was Georgi Voiteh, an initiator of the uprising of Peter III (Constantine Bodin) in 1072. During the reign of Samuil the kavkhan was Dometian, captured by the Byzantines and succeeded by his brother Teodor during the reign of Ivan Vladislav. During the Second Bulgarian Empire the title was not used. Another famous kavkhan is Peter who carried out three missions in Rome and one in Constantinople during the reign of Boris I. The most prominent kavkhan, as well as the one with most merits for Bulgaria was Isbul. He occupied that position during the reign of three Khans: Omurtag (814-831), Malamir (831-836) and his nephew Presian (836-852). His merits include the reconstruction of Pliska as a beautiful capital during Omurtag and the completion of the new centralized state administration. He ordered an action to catch the Byzantine spies. He was among the main initiators of the 30-year peace Treaty of 815 which was very favourable and useful for Bulgaria.

"Inshallah, Kashmir (also known as Inshallah, Kashmir: Living Terror) is a 2012 documentary film directed, produced and written by Ashvin Kumar. It is the story of contemporary Kashmir. A series of counterpointed testimonies, the heartbreaking coming-of-age of ordinary people; warped and brutalised by two decades of militancy and its terrible response. Tehelka says, ""Although the camera and narrator usually provide the impartial eye in a documentary, stitching the story together, in Inshallah, Kashmir it is the Kashmiris who weave their deadpan narrative into a cohesive picture. Their matter-of-fact monotone says more than an entire valley of screams could."" The film opens with ex-militants describing the torture they underwent when captured by the army. A Hindu describes his sentiment on being a part of the minority in the region at the height of militancy, when his grandfather was shot dead by militants. A politician and her husband describe the horror of being kidnapped and in captivity for over a month – and despite that, forming a human bond with the militants, and helping them escape when the army closed in on them. One understands from this section that militancy was not binary in nature. It was a dynamic and complex, resulting from various socio-political, economic and religious issues. Disappearances and fake encounters led to the creation of mass graves, hidden away in sensitive border areas that civilians and journalists are not permitted to access in the name of national security. Human rights lawyer and activist Parvez Imroz reveals to us the presence of almost a thousand such graves in the valley. Rape victims from Kunan Poshpora describe the trauma they went through at the hands of the army and the stigma that they still face due to the incident. The film also narrates how the minority Hindu Kashmiri Pandits were effectively cleansed from the valley as the majority of them fled the Islamic Terrorists. At several points in the movie, Kashmiri Muslims describe how the males are picked up and taken to Pakistan to be trained as terrorists. One former terrorist describes how his job will not be completed until Islam is spread through India and the World. He is prepared to die as he is firmly convinced he will go to heaven – though he cannot describe his concept of heaven. One Kashmiri woman openly admits that she sympathises with Pakistani Militants as they are Muslim. There are no interviews with the Indian Military in the movie. The film then leads us to 'normalcy' or the social ramifications the last twenty years of devastation brought to the valley. Militancy in Kashmir resulted in the Government of India deploying tens of thousands of armed troops in the region. We hear the story of one boy who lost his leg because he was caught in crossfire. The film ends on a poignant note with a young artist saying 'I need my space.' On 18 January, Alipur Films uploaded the first seven minutes of the film Inshallah Kashmir: Living Terror online. Social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter picked it up and the link had over a ten thousand hits in a week and generated curiosity and contempt alike. Views had crossed over fifty thousand within a week. The idea of releasing Inshallah Kashmir online and free of charge was to take the film to the masses, and to make it accessible to as many people as possible – in Kashmir, within India and around the world. The full film went online on 26 January 2012, on the Indian Republic day and had over almost fifteen thousand hits that day. Kumar plans to apply for a censor certificate and let his audience decide the fairness of the judgment of the Indian Censor Board, by making public all the details of the application along the way.

There were 130 housing units at an average density of 3.5 per square mile (1.4km2). The racial makeup of the township was 97.28% White, 0.27% Native American, 0.27% Asian, 1.91% from other races, and 0.27% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.09% of the population. There were 123 households, out of which 39.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 74.0% were married couples living together, 1.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 17.1% were non-families. 12.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 4.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.98 and the average family size was 3.24. In the township the population was spread out, with 28.6% under the age of 18, 10.4% from 18 to 24, 26.7% from 25 to 44, 22.6% from 45 to 64, and 11.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 117.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 123.9 males. The median income for a household in the township was $54,375, and the median income for a family was $57,250. Males had a median income of $30,179 versus $23,750 for females. The per capita income for the township was $18,806. About 6.2% of families and 8.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.7% of those under age 18 and 27.9% of those age 65 or over.",Normal
"Samuel Alfred Barrett (1879 in Conway, Alaska – 1965) was an anthropologist and linguist who studied Native American peoples. Barrett received all three of his degrees from UC Berkeley—B.S. in 1905, M.S. in 1906, and a doctorate in Anthropology, Phonetics, and Ethno-geography 1908. From 1903-1907, Barrett did fieldwork research in Pomo, Miwok, Maidu, Yokuts, Yuki, and Wintun communities. Barrett's system of naming the languages of the Pomoan group included seven names based on geographical terms: Northern Pomo, Northeastern Pomo, Southern Pomo, Eastern Pomo, Central Pomo, Southeastern Pomo, and Southwest Pomo (now more commonly referred to as Kashaya). This nomenclature has been criticized for suggesting that the various Pomoan languages are dialects of a single language, when they are in fact mutually unintelligible and therefore distinct languages. Following this research, from 1908-1909, Barrett worked as an ethnologist on the George G. Heye Expedition, conducting linguistic research with Chachi peoples. Barrett became a Curator of Anthropology at the Milwaukee Public Museum in Milwaukee from 1909-1920. He then held the position of director at this institution until 1940.  While working at the Milwaukee Public Museum, Barrett was sent on collecting trips. One of the first of these trips was to Northern Wisconsin where he collected materials from Ojibwe and Menominee communities. In 1911, Barrett collected materials for the museum from Hopi and, from 1914-1915, Barrett conducted a collecting trip in Alert Bay with Kwakwaka'wakw communities. In 1915, he conducted another collecting trip within Paiute and Washoe communities. In 1921, he traveled to Browning, Montana and collected materials for the Milwaukee Public Museum from Niitsitapi communities.  From 1953-1957, Barrett conducted ethnographic research with Hupa, Yurok, and Karuk peoples. This research was done in connection with Alfred Kroeber.  The final major work of his life was to produce a series of films about the peoples of Northern California such as the Pomo, particularly the Kashaya.

"Mexican muralism refers to the art project initially funded by the Mexican government in the immediate wake of the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) to depict visions of Mexico's past, present, and future, transforming the walls of many public buildings into didactic scenes designed to reshape Mexicans' understanding of the nation's history. The murals, large artworks painted onto the walls themselves had social, political, and historical messages. Beginning in the 1920s, the muralist project was headed by a group of artists known as ""The Big Three"" or ""The Three Greats"". This group was composed of Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. Although not as prominent as the Big Three, women also created murals in Mexico. From the 1920s to the 1970s, many murals with nationalistic, social and political messages were created in many public settings such as chapels, schools, government buildings, and much more. The popularity of the Mexican muralist project started a tradition which continues to this day in Mexico; a tradition that has had a significant impact in other parts of the Americas, including the United States, where it served as inspiration for the Chicano art movement. Mexico has had a tradition of painting murals, starting with the Olmec civilization in the pre Hispanic period and into the colonial period, with murals mostly painted to evangelize and reinforce Christian doctrine. The modern mural tradition has its roots in the 19th century, with this use of political and social themes. The first Mexican mural painter to use philosophical themes in his work was Juan Cordero in the mid-19th century. Although he did mostly work with religious themes such as the cupola of the Santa Teresa Church and other churches, he painted a secular mural at the request of Gabino Barreda at the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria (since disappeared). The latter 19th century was dominated politically by the Porfirio Díaz regime. This government was the first to push for the cultural development of the country, supporting the Academy of San Carlos and sending promising artists abroad to study. However, this effort left out indigenous culture and people, with the aim of making Mexico like Europe. Gerardo Murillo, also known as Dr. Atl, is considered to be the first modern Mexican muralist with the idea that Mexican art should reflect Mexican life. Academy training and the government had only promoted imitations of European art. Atl and other early muralists pressured the Diaz government to allow them to paint on building walls to escape this formalism. Atl also organized an independent exhibition of native Mexican artists promoting many indigenous and national themes along with color schemes that would later appear in mural painting. The first modern Mexican mural, painted by Atl, was a series of female nudes using ""Atlcolor"", a substance Atl invented himself, very shortly before the beginning of the Mexican Revolution. Another influence on the young artists of the late Porfirian period was the graphic work of José Guadalupe Posada, who mocked European styles and created cartoons with social and political criticism. Critiquing the political policies of the Díaz dictatorship through art was popularized by Posada. Posada influenced muralists to embrace and continue criticizing the Díaz dictatorship in their works. The muralists also embraced the characters and satire present in Posada's works. The Mexican Revolution itself was the culmination of political and social opposition to Porfirio Díaz policies. One important oppositional group was a small intellectual community that included Antonio Curo, Alfonso Reyes and José Vasconcelos. They promoted a populist philosophy that coincided with the social and political criticism of Atl and Posada and influenced the next generation of painters such as Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. These ideas gained power as a result of the Mexican Revolution, which overthrew the Díaz regime in less than a year. However, there was nearly a decade of fighting among the various factions vying for power. Governments changed frequently with a number of assassinations, including that of Francisco I. Madero who initiated the struggle. It ended in the early 1920s with one-party rule in the hands of the Álvaro Obregón faction, which became the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI). During the Revolution, Atl supported the Carranza faction and promoted the work of Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros, who would later be the founders of the muralism movement. Through the war and until 1921, Atl continued to paint murals among other activities including teaching the Mexico's next generation of artists and muralists. In 1921, after the end of the military phase of the Revolution, General Alvaro Obregón rose to power. In the aftermath of the Revolution, Mexico had entered a transition from an ""oligarchic"" state to a ""modernizing"" state, one that favored urbanization and the bourgeoisie citizens of society. As the country underwent this reformation, General Obregón realized that the reconstruction of a post-revolution Mexico would require a comprehensive alteration of symbols associated with Mexican identity on both cultural and political grounds. Shortly after the wars end, Obregón appointed José Vasconcelos to act as the Secretaría de Educación Pública, or Minister of Public Education. In his efforts to help raise a sense of nationalism and promote the inclusion of the masses in political and social ideologies, it was Vasconcelos' idea to have a government-backed mural project. His time as secretary was short but it set how muralism would develop. His image was painted on a tempera mural in 1921 by Roberto Montenegro, but this was short lived. His successor at the Secretaría de Educación Pública ordered it painted out. Parallel to the utilization of murals during the pre-Hispanic and the colonial period, the murals were not to simply satisfy aesthetic purposes, but to promote certain social ideals in the Mexican people. These ideals or principles were to glorify the Mexican Revolution and the identity of Mexico as a mestizo nation. This placed great emphasis on the pride associated with the indigenous culture of Mexico. The government began to hire the country's best artists to paint murals, calling some of them home from their time in Europe, including Diego Rivera. These initial muralists included Dr. Atl, Ramón Alva de la Canal, Federico Cantú and others but the main three artists that spearheaded the muralist project were David Alfaro Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco and Diego Rivera. These three artists, commonly known as ""Los Tres Grandes"", claimed to act as both the ""'voice and vote' of the Mexican national consciousness,"" calling themselves ""guardians of the national soul"". The muralists differed in style and temperament, but all believed that art was for the education and betterment of the people. This was behind their acceptance of these commissions as well as their creation of the Syndicate of Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors. The first government sponsored mural project was on the three levels of interior walls of the old Jesuit institution Colegio San Ildefonso, at that time used for the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria. Most of the murals in the Escuela National Preparatoria, or National Preparatory School, were done by José Clemente Orozco with themes of a mestizo Mexico, the ideas of renovation, and the reality of the Revolution's violence. Also at the National Preparatory School, Fernando Leal painted Los Danzantes de Chalma (Dancers of Chalma) no earlier than 1922. Opposite that mural, Jean Charlot painted La conquista de Tenochtitlán (Conquest of Tenochtitlan) by Jean Charlot—invited by Leal. Rivera also contributed his first-ever government-backed mural to the National Preparatory School in 1922 called Creation, functioning as an allegorical depiction of the holy trinity representing love, hope, and faith. The movement was strongest from the 1920s to the 1950s, which corresponded to the country's transformation from a mostly rural and mostly illiterate society to an industrialized one. While today, Murals are seen as symbols of Mexican identity, at the time they were controversial, especially those with socialist messages plastered on centuries-old colonial buildings. One of the basic underpinnings of the nascence of a post revolutionary Mexican art was that it should be public, available to the citizenry and above all not the province of a few wealthy collectors. The great societal upheaval made the concept possible as well as a lack of relatively wealthy middle class to support the arts. On this, the painters and the government agreed. One other point of agreement was that artists should have complete freedom of expression. This would lead to another element added to the murals over their development. In addition to the original ideas of a reconstructed Mexico and the elevation of Mexico's indigenous and rural identity, many of the muralists, including the three main painters, also included elements of Marxism, especially in trying to frame the struggle of the working class against oppression. This struggle, which had been going on since the sixteenth century, along with class, culture, and race conflicts were interpreted by muralists. The inception and early years of Mexico's muralist movement are often considered the most ideologically pure and untainted by contradictions between socialist ideals and government manipulation. This initial phase is referred to as the ""heroic"" phase while the period after 1930 is the ""statist"" phase with the transition to the latter phase caused by José Vasconcelos's resignation in 1924. Scholar Mary Coffey describes those who ""acknowledge a change but refrain from judgment about its consequences"" as taking the soft line and those who see all murals after 1930 as ""propaganda for a corrupt state"" as taking a hard line. Another stance is that the evolution of Mexican muralism as having an uncomplicated relationship with the government and as an accurate reflection of avant-garde and proletariat sentiments. However, hard liners see the movement as complicit in the corrupt government's power consolidation under the guise of a socialist regime. Art historian Leonard Folgarait has a slightly different view. He marks 1940 as the end of the post-revolutionary period in Mexico as well as the renaissance era of the muralist movement. The conclusion of the Lázaro Cárdenas administration (1934 – 1940) and the beginning of the Manuel Avila Camacho (1940 – 1946) administration saw the rise of an ultraconservative Mexico. The country's policy was aimed at maintaining and strengthening a capitalist society. Mural artists like the Big Three spent the post-revolutionary period developing their work based on the promises of a better future, and with the advent of conservatism they lost their subject and their voice. The Mexican government began to distance itself from mural projects and mural production became relatively privatized. This privatization was a result of patronage from the growing national bourgeoisie. Murals were increasingly contracted for theaters, banks, and hotels. Mexican populist art production from the 1920s to the 1950s is often grouped under the name of Escuela Mexicana de Pintura y Escultura, coined in the 1930s by art historians and critics. The term is not well-defined as it does not distinguish among some important stylistic and thematic difference, there is no firm agreement which artists belong to it nor if muralism should be considered part of it or if these artworks should be left separate from the more well-known murals of the movement. It is not a school in the classic sense of the word as it includes work by more than one generation and with different styles that sometimes clash. However, it does involve a number of important characteristics. Mexican School mural painting was a combination of public ideals and artistic aesthetics ""positioned as a constituent of the official public sphere."" Three formal components of official Mexican muralism are defined as: 1) Direct participation in official publicity and discourse 2) Reciprocal integration of the visual discourse of the mural to an array of communicative practices participant in defining official publicity (including a variety of scriptural genres, but also public speech, debate and provocative public ""event"") 3) The development and public thematizing of a social-realist aesthetic (albeit multiform in character) as the visual register for the public sense of the mural work and as the doxic, or unquestioned, limits for public dispute over the representational space of the mural image Most painters in this school worked in Mexico City or other cities in Mexico, working almost uninterrupted on projects andor as teachers, generally with support of the government. Most were concerned with the history and identity of Mexico and politically active. Most art from this school was not created for direct sale but rather for diffusion in both Mexico and abroad. Most were formally trained, often studying in Europe andor in the Academy of San Carlos. A large quantity of murals were produced in most of the country from the 1920s to 1970, generally with themes related to politics and nationalism focused often on the Mexican Revolution, mestizo identity and Mesoamerican cultural history. Scholar Teresa Meade states that ""indigenismo; the glorification of rural and urban labor and the working man, woman, and child; social criticism to the point of ridicule and mockery; and denunciation of the national, and especially, international ruling classes"" were also themes present in the murals at this time. These served as a form of cohesion among members of the movement. The political and nationalistic aspects had little directly to do with the Mexican Revolution, especially in the later decades of the movement. The goal was more to glorify the revolution itself, highlighting its results as a means to legitimatize the post Revolution government. The other political orientation was that of Marxism, especially class struggle. This political group grew strongest in the early movement with Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros all of which being openly avowed communists. The political messages became less radical but they remained firmly to the left. Much of the mural production glorified indigenismo, or the indigenous aspect of Mexican culture as artists of the movement collectively considered it to be an important factor in the reconstruction of a more modern Mexico. These themes were added with the idea of reexamining the country's history from a different perspective. One other aspect that most of the muralists shared was a rejection of the idea that art was only for the elite, but rather as a benefit for the masses. The various reasons for the focus on ancient Mesoamerica may be divided into three basic categories: the desire to glorify the accomplishments of the perceived original cultures of the Mexican nation; the attempt to locate residual pre-Hispanic forms, practices, and beliefs among contemporaneous indigenous peoples; and the study of parallels between the past and present. Within this last context, the torture of Cuauhtémoc was painted by Siqueiros in 1950 in the Palacio Nacional, one of his few depictions of indigenous cultures of any period. Many of the murals from the muralist project took on monumental status because of where they were situated, mostly on the walls of colonial era government buildings and the themes that were painted. The mural painters of Mexico freely shared ideas and techniques in public spaces in order to capture the attention of the masses. While many of the themes are shared between artists, the work of each artist was distinctive as the government did not impose a set style. These artists were so distinctive that they can generally be deduced without needing to look at the artist's signatures. Techniques used in the production of these murals also included the revival of old techniques such as the fresco, painting on freshly plastered walls and encaustic or hot wax painting. Others used mosaics and high fire ceramics, as well as metal parts, and layers of cement. The most innovative of the artists was Siqueiros, who worked with pyroxene, a commercial enamel, and Duco (used to paint cars), resins, asbestos and old machinery, and was one of the first to use airbrush for artistic purposes. He pored, sprayed, dripped and splattered paint for the effects they created haphazardly. By far, the three most influential muralists from the 20th century are Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and David Siqueiros, called ""los tres grandes"" (the three great ones). All believed that art was the highest form of human expression and a key force in social revolution. Their work was the driving force that defined the movement originally set into motion by Vasconcelos. It created a mythology around the Mexican Revolution and the Mexican people which is still influential to this day, as well as promote Marxist ideals. At the time the works were painted, they also served as a form of catharsis over what the country had endured during the war. However, the three were different in their artistic expression. To summarize the general types of contributions the Three Greats made, Rivera's works were utopian and idealist, Orozco's were critical and pessimistic, while the most radical of the three was Siqueiros, who heavily focused on a scientific future. These three different points of views on the war was shaped by their own personal experiences with Mexican Revolution. In Rivera case, he was in Europe during the revolution and had never experienced the horrors of the war. While never experiencing the war first hand, his art primarily focused on what he perceived to be the social benefits from the revolution. Orozco and Siqueiros, on the other hand, both fought in the war, which subsequently resulted in a more pessimistic approach to their artwork when depicting the revolution; with Siqueros' artwork being notably more radical and focused on portraying a scientific future. Of the three, Diego Rivera was the most traditional in terms of painting styles, drawing heavily from European modernism. In his narrative mural images, Rivera incorporated elements of cubism His themes were Mexican, often scenes of everyday life and images of ancient Mexico. He originally painted this in bright colors in the European style but modified it to more earthy tones to imitate indigenous murals. His greatest contribution is the promotion of Mexico's indigenous past into how many people both inside and outside of the country view it. One of the most prominent examples of this is Rivera's contribution to the Mexican National Palace, translated as The History of Mexico, which he worked on from1929-1935. José Clemente Orozco's art also began with a European style of expression; however, his art developed into an angry denunciation of oppression especially by those he considered to be of the evil and brutal higher economic class. His work was somber and dire, with emphasis on human suffering and fear of the technology of the future, intent on displaying the reality of the war. His work shows an ""expressionist use of color, slashing lines, and parodic distortions of the human figure."" Like most other muralists, Orozco condemned the Spanish as destroyers of indigenous culture, but he did have kinder depictions such as that of a Franciscan friar tending to an emaciated indigenous period. Unlike other artists, Orozco never glorified the Mexican Revolution, having fought in it, but rather depicted the horrors of this war. It caused many of his murals to be heavily criticized and even defaced. David Alfaro Siqueiros was the youngest and most radical of the three. He joined the Venustiano Carranza army when he was eighteen and experienced the Revolution from the front lines. Although all three muralists were communists, Siqueiros was the most dedicated, as evidenced by his portrayals of the proletarian masses. His work is also characterized with rapid, sweeping, bold lines and the use of modern enamels, machinery and other elements related to technology. His style showed a ""futurist blurring of form and technique."" His fascination with technology as it relates to art was exemplified when he emphasized the mass communications visual technology of photograph and motion picture in his eventual movement toward neorealism. His radical politics made him unwelcome in Mexico and the United States, so he did much of his work in South America. However, his masterpiece is considered to be the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros, located in Mexico City. While Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros are usually regarded as the most influential mural artists of the period, Rufino Tamayo also contributed to the movement of the 1920s. Tamayo was younger than the Big Three and he often argued against their attitudes. He argued against their isolationist work after his art studies in Europe where he became heavily influenced by post World War II abstractions. He believed that the Mexican Revolution would ultimately harm Mexico due to the progressive attitudes that were arising. When he returned to Mexico after staying in Europe, he wanted his artwork to express pre-Conquest art but in his own abstract style. Tamayo was heavily influenced by the early pre-Columbian history of Mexico and it is evident in his piece titled ""Nacimiento de Nuestra Nacionalidad"". He expresses the violence that was used during the Spanish conquest of native Mexicans. The center shows a human figure holding a mechanical weapon, sitting atop a horse and surrounded by a glowing light which depicted a 'godlike' Spanish conquistador. The horse is shaped like a majestic creature because it was a creature that the native Mexicans had never seen before. Overall, this piece offers an immense amount of imagery and is a reflection of the initial defeat of Mexican nationalism and shows the traumatic and oppressive history. Tamayo was proud of his Mexican roots and expressed his nationalism in a more traditional way than Rivera or Siqueiros. His focus was on accepting both his Spanish and native background and ultimately expressing the way he felt through the colors, shapes and culture in a modern abstract way. Ultimately, Tamayo wanted the Mexican people to not forget their roots; it shows why he was so persistent in using inspiration from the pre-Columbian period as well as incorporating his own perspective of the Mexican Revolution. One of the best examples of Rivera's perspective on the revolution can be seen in his mural at the chapel of the Chapingo Autonomous University (murals) The most dominant artwork in this mural is The Liberated Earth 1926-27 Fresco which depicts Rivera's second wife, Guadalupe Marín, Voluptuous and recumbent, hand held aloft, she symbolizes the fertility of the land, and exudes a dominant, life-affirming energy which triumphs artistically against the injustices depicted elsewhere. This artwork sits as the final site to be seen, representing Rivera's view of what the Mexican revolution would bring – a free and productive earth in which natural forces being able to be harnessed for the benefit of man. To say Liberated Earth acts as a fictional finalism of a social Mexico would be supported by the preceding artworks in Chapingo Chapel. These prior artworks showcase the evolution of the agrarian movement paralleled with the evolution of Earth, both timelines of events being heavily reflective of Rivera's own positive views. Orozco's view point on the Mexican Revolution can be seen in his mural The Trench (1922-1924), Mexico that can be found at the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria. The dynamic lines and diluted color palette exemplify the dismal tone Orozco sets to exemplify his negative attitude towards the revolution. Contrary to many other revolutionary artists, one can also note how Orozco leaves the faces of the soldiers hidden, further displaying his own ideologies about the war. This form of anonymity functions as commentary towards the war and the soldiers that fought for the revolution – that they will be forgotten, despite their courageous sacrifice in hopes of a brighter future. From this more violent and realistic representation of the revolution, Orozco's aim is to get viewers to question if the revolutionary war was worth the sacrifices made. These artworks sparked massive controversy, even leading to the defacing of this mural, but was then later repainted in 1926. Siqueiros brought a nuance to the idea of the Mexican Revolution. Although he held a radically negative opinion towards the revolution, he also depicted images of the scientific future while the other two artists' primary focus was on their experience and view on the revolution. In 1939 Siqueros, in collaboration with a group of other revolutionary artists, constructed a mural at the Electrical Workers Union Building titled Portrait of the Bourgeoise (1939), Mexico City Mexico. Together, these artists aimed to present their belief that the violence of the revolutionary war stemmed from the utilization of the flaw economic system they knew as capitalism, used as a tool of perpetuating the control of fascist leaders. This piece of art demonstrates the horrors of war, the artists' own negative views toward the role of capitalism during the Revolution, and how the proletariat Mexican citizens were being overlooked and taken advantage of by the Bourgeoise. The emotional toll of war is also highlighted by the reaction of a frightened, on-looking mother and child pair, further reflecting the artist's own reactions toward capitalism. Among all of the pessimistic imagery is also a symbol of hope manifested by a lone man dressed in the clothing of a guerrilla fighter. He's seen grasping a rifle pointed towards Bourgeoise leaders present during the revolution. This symbolizes a promising future in which Mexico overcomes the obstacles faced in the revolution and embraces technology, as seen in the depictions of electrical towers at the top of the mural. The Big Three struggled to express their leftist leanings after the initial years painting murals under government supervision. These struggles with the post-revolution government lead the muralists to create a union of artists and produce a radical manifesto. José Vasconcelos, the Secretary of Public Education under President Álvaro Obregón (1920–24) contracted Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco to pursue painting with the moral and financial support of the new post-revolutionary government. Vasconcelos, while seeking to promote nationalism and ""la raza cósmica,"" seemed to contradict this sentiment as he guided the muralists to create works in a classic, European style. The murals became a target of Vasconcelos's criticism when the Big Three departed from classical proportion and figure. Siqueiros was dissatisfied with the incongruity between the murals and the revolutionary concerns of the muralists, and he advocated discussion among the artists of their future works. In 1922 the muralists founded the Union of Revolutionary Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors of Mexico. The Union then released a manifesto listing education, art of public utility, and beauty for all as the social goals of their future artistic endeavors. After nearly a century since the beginning of the movement, Mexican artists still produce murals and other forms of art with the same ""mestizo"" message. Murals can be found in government buildings, former churches and schools in nearly every part of the country. One recent example is a cross cultural project in 2009 to paint a mural in the municipal market of Teotitlán del Valle, a small town in the state of Oaxaca. High school and college students from Georgia, United States, collaborated with town authorities to design and paint a mural to promote nutrition, environmental protection, education and the preservation of Zapotec language and customs. Mexican muralism brought mural painting back to the forefront of Western art in the 20th century with its influence spreading abroad, especially promoting the idea of mural painting as a form of promoting social and political ideas. It offered an alternative to non-representational abstraction after World War I with figurative works that reflect society and its immediate concerns. While most Mexican muralists had little desire to be part of the international art scene, their influence spread to other parts of the Americas. Muralists influenced by Mexican muralism include Carlos Mérida of Guatemala, Oswaldo Guayasamín of Ecuador and Candido Portinari of Brazil. Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros all spent time in the United States. Orozco was the first to paint murals in the late 1920s at Pomona College in Claremont, California, staying until 1934 and becoming popular with academic institutions. During the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration employed artists to paint murals, which paved the way for Mexican muralists to find commissions in the country. Rivera lived in the United States from 1930 to 1934. During this time, he put on an influential show of his easel work at the Museum of Modern Art. The success of Orozco and Rivera prompted U.S. artists to study in Mexico and opened doors for many other Mexican artists to find work in the country. Siqueiros did not fare as well. He was exiled to the US from Mexico in 1932, moving to Los Angeles. During this time, he painted three murals, but they were painted over. The only one of the three to survive, América Tropical (full name: América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos, or Tropical America: Oppressed and Destroyed by Imperialism), was restored by the Getty Conservation Institute and the América Tropical Interpretive Center opened to provide public access. The concept of mural as political message was transplanted to the United States, especially in the former Mexican territory of the Southwest. It served as inspiration to the later Chicano muralism but the political messages are different. Revolutionary Nicaragua developed a tradition of muralism during the Sandinista period. Aurora Reyes Flores was a political activist, teacher, and the first recognized female Mexican muralist. She focused on highlighting problems of those that she considered unprotected. Her first mural, ""Atentado a Las Maestras Rurales"" (Attack on Rural Teachers), depicts a woman who is being dragged by the hair by a man who is also tearing up a book with his other hand. Another man, whose face is covered by the large sombrero on his head, also begins beating the woman with the butt of his rifle. Behind a door stand three children witnessing the violence take place as they look on in utter shock and disbelief. The mural reflected Reyes' concerns with the education system and the struggle to improve social conditions for working women. Elena Huerta's 450 square meter work is the largest mural created by a woman in Mexico, taking her two years to complete. Located in Saltillo, Mexico, the mural shows two different scenes. One scene depicts the independence of Mexico in 1810 with Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, while the other scene shows Hidalgo alongside contemporary independence leaders who contributed to the independence movements of Mexico. Huerta was not only known for her artwork, but also for her literary works, as she was a writer and feminist. In her lifetime, she was able to create only three murals. She captured the true essence of the Mexican Muralist movement through her passion and ability to keep Mexican culture viable. As Rina Lazo worked alongside Rivera, she became heavily influenced by his artwork and even helped him on one of the most outstanding murals of the Mexican Revolution: ""Sueno de Una Tarde Dominical en la Alameda Central"" (Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in Alameda Central Park). She became Rivera's assistant for a total of ten years, right up until his death in 1957. However, she also worked on her own pieces and ultimately had to navigate through her own personal struggles on how to fully depict Mexican nationalism in her own way. Moreover, painting alongside Rivera helped her understand the concepts of Mexican muralism which captured social and political awareness but also showed the indigenous roots that have shaped Latin Americans and Mexicans. At the time, it was rare for a woman to have such popularity and independence, but despite working in a heavily male dominated field, Lazo successfully managed to become a muralist. While she was originally from Guatemala, Huerta began to grow fond of Mexico during her collaboration with Rivera despite originally being from Guatemala, ultimately showing the influence that the Mexican Revolution had through her artwork. Considered one of the first female artists of the Mexican muralism movement, she painted several murals, the most important one being located at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City.",Normal
"National Alliance (Italian: Alleanza Nazionale, AN) was a national conservative political party in Italy. It was the successor of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), a neo-fascist party founded in 1946 by former followers of Benito Mussolini that had moderated its policies over its last decades and finally distanced itself from its former ideology, a move known as post-fascismo, during a convention in Fiuggi by dissolving into the new party in 1995. Gianfranco Fini was the leader of AN from its foundation through 2008, after being elected President of the Chamber of Deputies. Fini was succeeded by Ignazio La Russa, who managed the merger of the party with Forza Italia (FI) into The People of Freedom (PdL) in 2009. A group of former AN members, led by La Russa, left PdL in 2012 to launch the Brothers of Italy (FdI), while others remained in the PdL and were among the founding members of the relaunched Forza Italia (FI) in 2013. National Alliance was launched in 1994 when the Italian Social Movement (MSI), the former neo-fascist party, merged with conservative elements of the former Christian Democracy, which had disbanded in 1994 after two years of scandals and various splits due to political corruption at its highest levels, exposed by the Mani pulite investigation, and the Italian Liberal Party, disbanded in the same year. It was officially launched in January 1995. Former MSI members dominated the new party, and the MSI's last leader, Gianfranco Fini, was elected the new party's first leader. The AN logo followed a template very similar to that of the Democratic Party of the Left, incorporating the MSI logo in a small roundel of the AN logo as a means of legally preventing others from using it. The name was suggested by an article on the Italian newspaper Il Tempo written in 1992 by Domenico Fisichella, a prominent conservative academic. Starting in the 1990s, the MSI gradually transformed into a mainstream right-wing party, culminating in its 1995 dissolution into AN. The party was part of all three House of Freedoms coalition governments led by Silvio Berlusconi. Fini was nominated Deputy Prime Minister after the 2001 Italian general election and was Foreign Minister from November 2004 to May 2006. When Fini visited Israel in late November 2003 in the function of Italian Deputy Prime Minister, he labelled the racial laws issued by the Italian fascism regime in 1938 as ""infamous"", as also Giorgio Almirante, historic leader of MSI, had done before. He also referred to the Italian Social Republic as belonging to the most shameful pages of the past, and considered fascism part of an era of ""absolute evil"", something which was hardly acceptable to the few remaining hardliners of the party. As a result, Alessandra Mussolini, the granddaughter of the former fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, who had been at odds with the party on a number of issues for a long time, and some hardliners left the party and formed Social Action. In occasion of the 2006 Italian general election, AN ran within the House of Freedoms, with new allies. The centre-right lost by 24,000 votes in favour of the centre-left coalition The Union. Individually, AN received nearly 5 million votes, amounting to 12.3%. In July 2007, a group of splinters led by Francesco Storace formed The Right, which was officially founded on 10 November. Seven MPs of AN, including Teodoro Buontempo and Daniela Santanchè, joined the new party. In November 2007, Silvio Berlusconi announced that Forza Italia would have soon merged or transformed into The People of Freedom (PdL) party. After the sudden fall of the Prodi II Cabinet in January 2008, the break-up of The Union and the subsequent political crisis which led to a fresh general election, Berlusconi hinted that Forza Italia would have probably contested its last election and the new party would have been officially founded only after that election. In an atmosphere of reconciliation with Gianfranco Fini, Berlusconi also stated that the new party could see the participation of other parties. Finally, on 8 February, Berlusconi and Fini agreed to form a joint list under the PdL banner, allied with Lega Nord (LN). After the victory of the PdL in the 2008 Italian general election, AN was merged into the PdL in early 2009. National Alliance's political programme emphasised: Distinguishing itself from the MSI, the party distanced itself from Benito Mussolini and fascism, and made efforts to improve relations with Jewish groups. For example, after far-right skinheads celebrated the then-AN politician Gianni Alemanno's election as Mayor of Rome in 2008 by making the Roman salute outside the Palazzo Senatorio, Alemanno visited Rome Synagogue, where he gave a speech praising what he called the universal values of the fight against Nazism. The shift was also present in the rhetoric of the party's leader Fini, who went from declaring himself as ""fascist for the 2000s"" in 1987 when at the head of the MSI, to describing himself as a conservative at the time of the AN's launch in 1994. With most hardliners leaving the party, it sought to present itself as a respectable conservative party and to join forces with Forza Italia in the European People's Party and eventually in a united party of the centre-right. Historian David Broder has compared the AN to the People's Party in Spain, a post-Francisco Franco party. Although the party approved the market economy and held favourable views on liberalisation and the privatisation of state-owned companies, AN was to the left of Forza Italia on economic issues and sometimes supported statist policies. That is why the party was strong in Rome and Lazio, where most civil servants live. The implosion of the Christian Democrats created space for a more economically interventionist party of the conservative right, and the AN sought closer ties to the former DC factions that joined the Berlusconi-led alliances of the right. As part of this, it also moderated its stances on the European Union and immigration, both of which were conditionally accepted by the party's leadership. Moreover, AN presented itself as a party promoting national cohesion, national identity, and patriotism. Regarding institutional reforms, the party was a long-time supporter of presidentialism and a plurality voting system, and came to support also federalism and to fully accept the alliance with Lega Nord, although the relations with that party were tense at times, especially about issues regarding national unity. Fini, a moderniser who saw Nicolas Sarkozy and David Cameron as role-models, impressed an ambitious political line to the party, combining the pillars of conservative ideology like security, family values, and patriotism with a more progressive approach in other areas, such as stem cell research and supporting voting rights for legal aliens. Some of these positions were not shared by many members of the party, most of whom staunchly opposed stem cell research and artificial insemination. National Alliance was a heterogeneous political party and within it members were divided in different factions, some of them very organised: In the party there was also a group named Ethic-Religious Council, whose board members included Gaetano Rebecchini (founder, ex-DC), Riccardo Pedrizzi (president), Franco Tofoni (vice-president), Luigi Gagliardi (secretary-general), Alfredo Mantovano, Antonio Mazzocchi, and Riccardo Migliori. This was not a faction but an official organism within the party and expressed the official position of the party on ethical and religious matters. Sometimes the group criticised Fini for his liberal views on abortion, artificial insemination, and stem-cell research, which led some notable ex-DC members as Publio Fiori to leave the party. Some members of the council, such as Pedrizzi and Mantovano, were described as members of an unofficial Catholic Right faction. The party had roughly 10–15% support across Italy, having its strongholds in Central Italy, as well as Southern Italy (Lazio 18.6%, Umbria 15.2%, Marche 14.3%, Abruzzo 14.3%, Apulia 13.2%, Sardinia 12.9%, Tuscany 12.6%, and Campania 12.6% in the 2006 Italian general election), scoring badly in Lombardy (10.2%) and Sicily (10.9%), while competing in the North-East (Friuli-Venezia Giulia 15.5% and Veneto 11.3%). The party had a good showing in the first general election in which it took part, achieving 13.5% of the popular vote in 1994 Italian general election). In the 1996 Italian general election, when Fini tried for the first time to replace Silvio Berlusconi as leader of the centre-right, the party grew its support to 15.7%. From that moment the party suffered an electoral decline but remained the third force of Italian politics. In the 2006 Italian general election, the final election in which the party participated on its own account, AN won 12.3% of the vote, securing 71 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 41 in the Senate. In the 2008 Italian general election, the party had 90 deputies (excluding Fiamma Nirenstein, Alessandro Ruben, and Souad Sbai, whose election was supported both by Forza Italia and National Alliance), and 48 senators, who were elected as part of a joint election list under the banner of The People of Freedom. The electoral results of National Alliance in general (Chamber of Deputies) and European Parliament elections since 1994 are shown in the chart below. The electoral results of National Alliance in the 10 most populated regions of Italy are shown in the table below.",Normal

The 2nd Foreign Cavalry Regiment (2e R.E.C) was created in July 1939 on the substance of the squadron groups of Morocco issued from the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment 1er R.E.C). At the outbreak of World War II, the 2nd Foreign Cavalry Regiment was stationed in Morocco and part of it were quickly attached to the 97th Reconnaissance Group of the Infantry Division (G.R.D 97) (French: Groupement de reconnaissance divisionnaire 97 (GRD97)), which engaged in combat in France during the German spring offensive of 1940, and whose commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Boyer de Latour, was killed leading at the bois de Noroy on 9 July. Following the armistice, the regiment was dissolved on November 15, 1940, and the regimental colours were entrusted to the honor guard of the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment. The 2nd Foreign Cavalry Regiment was officially dissolved on June 1, 1946, at Sidi Bel Abbès, but was recreated that November, garrisoned at Oujda, where the regiment remained until 1956. The mission of the regiment was to instruct and train reinforcements destined for the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment in the Far East. Following the Paris accords in 1954 and the departure for Indochina in 1955, the 2nd Foreign Cavalry Regiment participated to the securing of Moroccan territories, then from 1956 maintained order in Algeria, first in the sector of Laghouat, and from 1958 along the Tunisian border. In January 1962, the 2nd Foreign Cavalry Regiment made way on Biskra, but was dissolved again following the Evian accords. In 5 years of campaigning in Algeria, the 2nd Foreign Cavalry Regiment eliminated more than 1022 rebels and captured 697 arms, including 30 machine guns.

"I Corvi (Italian for ""The Crows"") is an Italian beat group who were successful in the 1960s. The group was formed in Parma in 1965, to perform cover versions of popular American and British records. The original members were Angelo Ravasini (vocals, guitar), Fabrizio ""Billo"" Levati (guitar), Italo ""Gimmi"" Ferrari (bass), and Claudio Benassi (drums). In early 1966, they took part in the first Rapallo Davoli national singing competition, finishing second. They were signed by Ariston Records, whose director, Alfredo Rossi, encouraged them to use a stage costume of black capes, and to always appear with a stuffed raven, either attached to the bass guitar or, in publicity photos, on the shoulder of one of the band members; the band duly christened the raven ""Alfredo"". Their first record, ""Un Ragazzo di Strada"" (""A Street Kid""), was a rewriting of The Brogues' ""I Ain't No Miracle Worker"", written by Annette Tucker and Nancie Mantz and with new Italian lyrics by Nicola Salerno and Franco Califano. The song was entered in the 1966 Cantagiro musical contest, becoming a popular success and the group's biggest hit. The group followed up with a version of ""Bang, Bang"" (written by Sonny Bono and originally recorded by Cher), and their first album, Un Ragazzo di Strada, which included versions of two Donovan songs. Later successful singles included ""Sospesa ad un Filo"" (""Hanging by a thread"", a rewrite of The Electric Prunes' ""I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night)"", also written by Tucker and Mantz), ""Bambolina"" (a version of ""Any Day Now"", co-written by Burt Bacharach), and ""Datemi un biglietto d'aereo"" (a version of The Box Tops' hit ""The Letter"", written by Wayne Carson). Levati and Ferrari left the group in 1969 and were replaced by guitarist Antonello Gabelli, keyboard player Massimo Vessella, and bassist Ennio Tricomi, but shortly afterwards, the group disbanded. Ravasini formed a new group, Angelo ei Corvissimi, while Benassi and Tricomi formed another group, I Nuovi Corvi (""The New Crows""), with Pino Corvino (guitar) and Giancarlo Lazzini (keyboards). They continued to perform until 1972. In 1983, I Corvi re-formed with a line-up of Ravasini, Ferrari, Tricomi, and Gabelli, and in 1989 recorded the album Hanno preso la Bastiglia! (""They took the Bastille!"") in a hard rock style. Gianluca Antolini later replaced Ferrari on bass, but the band continued to perform, with some further changes of personnel, until the late 1990s. Around 2000, Ravasini reconstituted the band with his sons Stefano and Luigi Ravasini, and other musicians. After leaving the band, Fabrizio ""Billo"" Levati became a club and radio DJ; he died in 2000, aged 53. Gimmi Ferrari died in 2006, and Angelo Ravasini in 2013. In 2014 the band was reformed by the original drummer Claudio Benassi. The renewed group started live promotion touring Italy. In 2017 a new album of rearranged songs was released. In 2020 a new song, the first original since 1989, ""L'ultimo dei Corvi"", was released. In 2021 Benassi wrote the official biography of the band.",Normal

"Village Presbyterian Church is a Presbyterian Church (USA) congregation founded on February 13, 1949, with 282 charter members, that has since grown to be one of the largest Presbyterian churches in America with a reported 4,789 members in 2013. Village Presbyterian Church was founded in February 1949 by Robert H. Meneilly. Prairie Village KS was a developing suburb in the 1940s with a high concentration of young families, and no Presbyterian church in the area. Meneilly went door-to-door in the emerging suburb to encourage residents to visit, and begin building a congregation before the building was complete. When the church opened for its first service on Sunday, Feb. 13, 1949, they drew 282 members to the congregation. In a report from Walter Cronkite which was previewed in a 1994 article in the Washington Post, Cronkite described Village Presbyterian as an “absolute perfect example of what is happening to churches all over the United States today in the split between the evangelical right and the more mainstream.” On February 5, 2017, Village Church became one church worshiping at two campuses, holding the first worship service at their first satellite campus located at 148th Street and Antioch Road in Overland Park, KS. Village Presbyterian began reconstruction of the main church space in April 2015. The mission of the rebuild was to install a new organ, make the church's sanctuary more accessible for disabled congregants, and install a new entrance and welcome center. The sanctuary renovation was completed in December, 2015 and the new organ arrived in September 2016. Village Presbyterian Church is home to one of the significant pipe organs in the region, Opus 22, built by Richards, Fowkes & Co. of Ooltewah, TN. The 3-manual, 59-stop, 74-rank mechanical action organ features a principal tonal design modeled after 18th-century Dutch organs with numerous added stops to support broad anthem and solo organ literature. The organ was played for the first time on Nov. 20, 2016 with just 5% of the organ pipes working. The organ was fully voiced and all 3,800 pipes were functioning by August 2017. In 2008, the Village Presbyterian Food Pantry opened. In August 2016, Village Presbyterian Child & Family Development Center opened. The multi-use building provides day care classrooms and support space for up to 132 students. In 2008, the current Village Presbyterian Food Pantry opened. Today, it hosts more than 300 volunteers each month. The pantry serves anyone in the area who completes an application and is near the Federal Poverty Guidelines. In August 2016, Village Presbyterian Child & Family Development Center opened. The multi-use building provides day care classrooms and support space for up to 132 students. Doctors and nurses from the Village congregation as well as the Kansas City area make four annual trips to La Romana on a medical mission to provide health care to the impoverished residents of rural bateyes and urban barrios. The church's youth department began an annual spring break mission trip to La Romana in the 1990s to work on construction projects like the Joe Hartman School. Front Porch Alliance is a partnership between Village Church and the Ivanhoe neighborhood of Kansas City. Front Porch Alliance provides mentor programs, home repair, and career services to residents of the east side neighborhood. The program was founded in 1999. The Environmental Action Committee was formed and renamed in 2007.",Normal
"FTP server return codes always have three digits, and each digit has a special meaning. The first digit denotes whether the response is good, bad or incomplete: The requested action is being initiated; expect another reply before proceeding with a new command. (The user-process sending another command before the completion reply would be in violation of protocol; but server-FTP processes should queue any commands that arrive while a preceding command is in progress.) This type of reply can be used to indicate that the command was accepted and the user-process may now pay attention to the data connections, for implementations where simultaneous monitoring is difficult. The server-FTP process may send at most, one 1xx reply per command. The requested action has been successfully completed. A new request may be initiated. The command has been accepted, but the requested action is being held in abeyance, pending receipt of further information. The user should send another command specifying this information. This reply is used in command sequence groups. The command was not accepted and the requested action did not take place, but the error condition is temporary and the action may be requested again. The user should return to the beginning of the command sequence, if any. It is difficult to assign a meaning to ""transient"", particularly when two distinct sites (Server- and User-processes) have to agree on the interpretation. Each reply in the 4xx category might have a slightly different time value, but the intent is that the user-process is encouraged to try again. A rule of thumb in determining if a reply fits into the 4xx or the 5xx (Permanent Negative) category is that replies are 4xx if the commands can be repeated without any change in command form or in properties of the User or Server (e.g., the command is spelled the same with the same arguments used; the user does not change his file access or user name; the server does not put up a new implementation.) The command was not accepted and the requested action did not take place. The User-process is discouraged from repeating the exact request (in the same sequence). Even some ""permanent"" error conditions can be corrected, so the human user may want to direct his User-process to reinitiate the command sequence by direct action at some point in the future (e.g., after the spelling has been changed, or the user has altered his directory status.) RFC 2228 introduced the concept of protected replies to increase security over FTP communications. The 6xx replies are Base64 encoded protected messages that serves as responses to secure commands. When properly decoded, these replies fall into the above categories. The second digit is a grouping digit and encodes the following information: These replies refer to syntax errors, syntactically correct commands that don't fit any functional category, unimplemented or superfluous commands. These are replies to requests for information, such as status or help. Replies referring to the control and data connections. Replies for the login process and accounting procedures. These replies indicate the status of the Server file system vis-a-vis the requested transfer or other file system action.

"The CIA Museum, administered by the Center for the Study of Intelligence, is a national archive for the collection, preservation, documentation and exhibition of intelligence artifacts, culture, and history. The collection, which in 2005 numbered 3,500 items, consists of artifacts that have been declassified; however, since the museum is on the compound of the George Bush Center for Intelligence it is not accessible to the public. Since the museum cannot be visited by the public, the CIA Museum has partnerships with Presidential Libraries and other major museums and institutions to develop public exhibitions dedicated to understanding the craft of intelligence and its role in the broader American experience. The CIA Museum has counterparts at other agencies in the United States Intelligence Community. The National Cryptologic Museum (which is open to the public in Annapolis Junction, Maryland) is the NSA counterpart to the CIA Museum and focuses on cryptology as opposed to human intelligence. The DIA Museum (Defense Intelligence Agency) is not public, is housed at its headquarters and focuses on the history of military intelligence and DIA's role. The FBI Museum housed at its headquarters is also off-limits to the public, and is focused on its history as a federal law enforcement, counterintelligence, and counter-terrorism organization. The CIA Museum's scope of collection includes material associated with all activities of the CIA's predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), material associated with activities of foreign intelligence organizations, and material associated with the history and mission of the Central Intelligence Agency.  Articles in the Museum Collection include clothing, equipment, weapons, memorabilia, and insignia designed, manufactured, or used by intelligence organizations historically and presently. The Collection also includes unique items such as weapons, clothing, and equipment developed specifically through research and development, or manufactured by units or individuals to further the mission of intelligence operations. The museum also displays Osama bin Laden's AK-47 along with a brick from the compound in which he was found at the time of his death. In September 2022, to mark the agency's 75th anniversary, a small group of journalists were given access to the museum. BBC journalist Gordon Corera mentioned seeing ""cold war spy gadgets"" such as ""'dead drop rat' in which messages could be hidden, a covert camera inside a cigarette packet, a pigeon with its own spy-camera and even an exploding martini glass."" As of 2017, The CIA Museum maintains three exhibits of important historical intelligence artifacts at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia. Dedicated in June 2002 to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the Office of Strategic Services, the CIA Museum's North Gallery houses an exhibit devoted to preserving the legacy CIA inherited from the OSS. The exhibit displays personal memorabilia from Major General William J.

"Proto-Gnosticism or pre-Gnosticism refers to movements similar to Gnosticism in the first few centuries of Christianity. Proto-Gnostics did not have the same full fledged theology of the later Gnostics but prefigured some of their views. There is however some debate regarding the existence of proto-Gnosticism in the first century. Some believe that the opponents mentioned in 1 John, Jude and 1-2 Corinthians are proto-Gnostics or partly proto-Gnostic. According to some the Corinthian church that was criticized by Paul the Apostle and which existed in the time of Paul included proto-Gnostic beliefs.",Normal
"Kwakwaka'wakw art describes the art of the Kwakwaka'wakw peoples of British Columbia. It encompasses a wide variety of woodcarving, sculpture, painting, weaving and dance. Kwakwaka'wakw arts are exemplified in totem poles, masks, wooden carvings, jewelry and woven blankets. Visual arts are defined by simplicity, realism, and artistic emphasis. Dances are observed in the many rituals and ceremonies in Kwakwaka'wakw culture. Much of what is known about Kwakwaka'wakw art comes from oral history, archeological finds in the 19th century, inherited objects, and devoted artists educated in Kwakwaka'wakw traditions. The learning of a craft is central to the education of young tribe members. Youths are encouraged to engage in craft work, and are apprenticed to more experienced experts. Some are employed by local chiefs as personal carvers, who are then tasked to produce wooden gifts bearing the house symbols to distribute in potlatch. Wealth from trade resulted in a Golden Age of potlatch art in the late 19th century, but to curb this perceived extravagance, the Canadian government outlawed the potlatch and other ceremonies with the Canadian Indian Act of 1884, which contributed to a decline in artistic production, some say. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, several artists earned their living as carvers in the manner described above, since their work was commissioned by their villages. Once the shock of those participants in the Cranmer potlatch in 1921 wore off and governments were realizing native populations were no longer on the decline, art as a means of earning a living was encouraged - as it had begun to be in Alaska. Some carvers with standing and longevity, and some apprenticed to them later stepped forward to participate in the revival of Kwakwaka'wakw art, including sculptors Dan Cranmer, Chief Willie Seaweed (1873–1967), Charlie James, Chief Mungo Martin (1879–1962) and his wife Abayah's greatgrandsons Tony Hunt (b. 1942) and Richard Hunt (b. 1951). Mary Ebbets Hunt and Abayah Martin, Mungo Martin's wife, were both important artists who produced many woven pieces. Traditionally, women were weavers, but Ellen Neel (1916–1966), Martin's niece, went on to become a noted carver. The art of the Kwakwaka'wakw peoples is similar to other styles in the realm of Northwest coast art, but with significant differences. Kwakwaka'wakw art can be defined by deep cuts into the wood, and a minimal use of paint reserved for emphasis purposes. Like other forms of Northwest coast art, Kwakwaka'wakw art employs ""punning"" or ""kenning"", a style that fills visual voids with independent figures and motifs - for example: a face painted in a whale fin. The materials used in Kwakwaka'wakw art include wood, horn, bark, shell, animal bone and various pigments. For wood, western red cedar (Thuja plicata) is preferred for large projects, as it grows in abundance along the Northwest coast. Yellow cedar (Callitropsis nootkatensis) was used for smaller objects. The wood is sometimes oiled for smaller carvings. Wood was steamed to make it more pliable. Horn is used to create tools, usually cooking utensils. To do this, the horn is softened by boiling, then bent and carved into the desired shape. For paint, red ochre is used, along with white paste from burnt clamshells and many others. Traditionally, tools have been made by the artisans themselves for personal use. Tools include adzes, carving knives, stone axes, stone hammers and paintbrushes. Brushes were sometimes made from porcupine hair. Later, the loom was used to weave blankets and curtains. Some tools were ceremonial, and thus decorated with carvings. The crafts of the Kwakwaka'wakw are made out of extensive woodwork, and include a wide variety of objects, from masks, effigies, rattles, storage boxes, food vessels to large totems and house posts. Virtually all crafts are painted to some extent. Masks were a vital part of Kwakwaka'wakw art and culture. The mask was crucial in dances in order to portray the character conveyed by the dancer. As such, a wide array of masks exist, depicting mythological beings, animals, forces of nature, and other humans. Some masks are decorated with feathers and ""hair"", usually represented by animal fur or strips of cedar bark. The following are a select few important types of masks: Jewelry amongst the Kwakwaka'wakw consisted of earrings, bracelets, necklaces, nose rings, lip piercings and more. Abalone shells, stone, ivory and wood were used in jewelry making. Contact with European settlers brought gold and silver, which were hammered into desired shapes. Silver and gold jewelry were often inscribed in patterns and mythological figures. Wooden hairpins have also been found. Copper in varying sizes was worn on the clothing of high-ranking individuals. Copper is also the term for beaten copper objects, often engraved and shaped like a ""T"" or a shield. These coppers symbolize great wealth and can be broken into pieces to give away at potlatches. Representations of shield-shaped coppers can be found on Kwakwaka'wakw poles. Textile arts in Kwakwaka'wakw culture are represented by ceremonial curtains, dance aprons, blankets and clothing. Weaving is most often done by women. The ceremonial curtain, or mawihl, is a painted curtain hung over the entrance to the dressing room used in dance ceremonies. Dancers could disappear behind the curtain as the scene demanded or to change their costumes. The mawihl was typically made from cotton, and painted with the spirit of the dancing house. The chilkat blanket was adopted by the Kwakwaka'wakw from the Tlingit and Tsimshian peoples to the north. These blankets are woven on a loom from shredded cedar bark and the wool of mountain goats. Chilkat blankets are heavy and extremely ornate; each taking almost a year to complete. As such, the blankets are highly valued amongst the Northwest coast peoples. The design has traditionally been first painted by a man, and then woven by a woman in accordance with the design. Designs are usually patterned and elaborate, showing a mosaic of ancestors and mythological figures. The fringes of the chilkat blanket are left with flowing threads of wool. A prominent weaver of chilkat blankets was Mary Ebbets Hunt. Hunt was a Tlingit woman who married an Englishman working in the Fort Rupert area, part of Kwakwaka'wakw territory. She had learned to weave from the northern tribes, and despite her reluctance to demonstrate her craft in front of Kwakwaka'wakw women, this technique was eventually passed on to the Kwakwaka'wakw. Button blankets become prevalent with the advent of the blanket trade. Button blankets or cloaks are brightly colored, usually with a navy blue base and red appliqué of Melton wool. Borders and a central motif, usually a family crest, are decorated with abalone or mother-of-pearl buttons. Dance aprons and leggings were also worn during ceremonies. The aprons were often decorated with trinkets such as small coppers, puffin beaks, deer hoofs, etc., which produced pleasing sounds while dancing. The totem pole is arguably the most complex and grandiose art form in Kwakwaka'wakw culture. Poles are placed outside family houses where they display the family's crests, history, wealth, social rank, inheritance, and privilege. The sequence of characters and symbols sculpted into a totem pole is indicative of past family events, ancestors, myths, and heraldic crests, with the bottom figure usually being the most prominent. The interpretation of the symbols is retold in a semi-legendary form when the pole is first dedicated to a certain house after completion. Kwakwaka'wakw totems are built from red cedar and can range between fifteen and fifty feet tall. The reputation of a pole's maker depended on the quality of his work. The Kwakwaka'wakw style of totem uses more protruding elements than other Northwest coast totems, such as stretching limbs, beaks jutting out, and wings thrust away from the body of the pole. Painting followed a scheme of alternating dark and light colors for contrast. Finally, like other forms of Kwakwaka'wakw art, Kwakwaka'wakw totems display a high emphasis on realism. House poles are posts supporting the homes of important tribal members. They are commissioned by the future homeowner and built by carvers of the tribe. Kwakwaka'wakw poles are noticeably simpler and bolder in construction, and tend to be thicker and well rounded. House posts depict ancestors, house symbols, and animals such as the sea lion and grizzly bear. A frontal ""entrance"" pole may be used, and is differentiated by the long opening at the bottom of the pole, and the fact that they are not supporting any part of the roof. A large variety of smaller wooden objects were carved by the Kwakwaka'wakw. These included whistles, rattles, kerfed boxes, effigies, staffs, utensils, ceremonial knives, headdresses, headbands and food vessels. Painting was traditionally used to decorate carvings and flat surfaces. Drafts for totems, masks and textiles were the first type of Kwakwaka'wakw painting. With the introduction of paper, artists branched into graphic art and produced many notable paintings. Later, local research organizations commissioned artists such as Ray Hanuse to paint interiors and exteriors with Kwakwaka'wakw motifs. Like other dancing societies of the Pacific Northwest, dance is a central part of Kwakwaka'wakw life, and is found at many rites and ceremonies. The dance is so important that each variety has to be carefully staged and prepared for. Special members of the tribe are designated to survey particular dances to see if they've been performed to satisfaction. Mistakes and poorly conducted dances could mean a loss of social position, or the stiffness of penalties; such as having to host a potlatch to regain prestige. The German anthropologist Franz Boas found a total of fifty-three different characters in Kwakwaka'wakw dance, each of them with a different role. Tsetseka (""Supernatural season"" or ""Winter Ceremonial"") is perhaps the most important dancing ritual amongst the Kwakwaka'wakw. The word comes from the Heiltsuk word for ""shaman"", and is used to refer to winter. The entire season is considered supernatural, and this is to be reflected in every ritual done during this time. The tsetseka dance is elaborately staged and planned by officials with specialized duties. Novices who are to be initiated into the dance are carefully prepared for the ceremony, with instructions on dramatic acting, dancing and proper cries. Intricate props and stage illusions are made ready, from hidden strings and tunnels for magic tricks to pounding noise on the roof in a simulation of mythical birds. The entire operation extends beyond the dancing house, as acts are deliberately planned for novices to be initiated into the ceremony. In one instance, a novice appeared to arrive on a canoe, but was drowned in an accident. Later he would be ""revived"" amidst much celebration. The figure that drowned was actually a wooden carving used to represent the novice. During tsetseka, the entire Kwakwaka'wakw living space became a sort of live theater, in which terror, drama, illusion and comedy were fully exploited to create the atmosphere of the special season. The hamatsa ritual is the most important dance in the tsetseka season. The purpose of the performance is to initiate a novice into a hamatsa dancer, the highest rank of dancer. Only individuals who have danced for twelve years through the previous three grades can attempt this accomplishment. The dance requires a large cast of characters, takes a total of four days to finish, and is steeped in ritual and drama. It is based around the legend of the hamatsa, terrible bird-like monsters that fed on human flesh. In the ceremony, the novice is possessed by a hamatsa spirit, and disappears into the woods for four days. While possessed, the novice must dance and cry as if in a frenzy, and interact with the audience in a wild and violent way. After four days, the subject has been ritually tamed until he is ""human"" again. Achieving this state signifies the novice's acceptance into the dancing society as a full member. David Neel (b. 1960), grandson of carver Ellen Neel, is a contemporary Kwakwaka'wakw painter, photographer, printmaker, and multimedia artist. His work demonstrates that Northwest Coastal art can meet the challenge of addressing current sociopolitical issues, for example his prints and masks that deal with land conflicts, radiation, oil spills, clear cutting, and overpopulation.",Normal
"General Charles Pelot Summerall (March 4, 1867 – May 14, 1955) was a senior United States Army officer. He commanded the 1st Infantry Division in World War I, was Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1926 to 1930, and was President of The Citadel between 1931 and 1953. Summerall was born in Blounts Ferry, Columbia County, Florida, on March 4, 1867, and attended the Porter Military Academy in South Carolina from 1882 to 1885. After graduation, he worked as a school teacher for three years. In 1888 he enrolled in the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York, graduating in June 1892. His fellow classmates included numerous men who would later attain general officer rank, such as Julian Robert Lindsey, Tracy Campbell Dickson, Frank W. Coe, William Ruthven Smith, James Ancil Shipton, Louis Chapin Covell, Preston Brown, George Blakely, Robert Mearns, Peter Weimer Davison, Howard Russell Hickok, Henry Howard Whitney, John E. Woodward, John McAuley Palmer and George Columbus Barnhardt. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, Summerall was assigned to the 1st Infantry Regiment, transferring to the 5th Artillery Regiment in March 1893. He performed garrison duty in California from 1893 to 1895, then served at Fort Hamilton, New York from 1895 to 1898. During the Spanish–American War, he was assigned to the Department of the Gulf as aide to the commander, Major General William Montrose Graham, and as an engineer officer in 1898 to 1899, receiving promotion to first lieutenant in March 1899. Summerall participated with his unit in the Philippine Insurrection in 1899 to 1900, and was a member of the China Relief Expedition in 1900 to 1901, participating in the attack on Peking. He was promoted to captain and assigned to the 106th Coast Artillery Company in July 1901. He served at Forts Walla Walla and Lawton, in Washington state, commanding the latter post in 1901 to 1902. He was on duty at Camp Skagway and was in charge of preliminary work at Fort Seward in Alaska. He commanded Fort Flagler in 1902 to 1903, and then was transferred to the 3rd Field Artillery Battery with duty at Camp Thomas and Fort Myer in 1903 to 1905. Summerall was the senior instructor of artillery tactics at West Point from 1905 to 1911. He was promoted to major in March 1911, and commanded the field artillery of the Maneuver Division at San Antonio, Texas. He commanded the summer camps of instruction for army and National Guard artillery in 1912 to 1914, was assistant chief of the Militia Bureau and in charge of National Guard artillery in 1915 to 1917. He was engaged in purchasing artillery ranges, and was a member of the Ordnance Board from 1915 to 1916, the commission to investigate the manufacture of munitions in 1916, the Board of Ordnance and Fortification in 1917, and the military mission to British and French armies in 1917. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1916, colonel in 1917, and brigadier general in the National Army in August 1917. Summerall commanded the 67th Field Artillery Brigade and the 1st Field Artillery Brigade in operations in France in 1917, was promoted to major general in the National Army, and successively commanded his brigade, the 1st Division, and V Corps, in the Cantigny, Soissons, St. Mihiel, and Meuse-Argonne operations in 1918. ""Late on November 9th, instructions from the Allied Commander-In-Chief were transmitted by G.H.Q., A.E.F., directing a general attack, which was executed by the First Army on November 10th–11th. Crossings of the Meuse were secured by General Summerall's (V) Corps during the night of November 10th–11th and the remainder of the army advanced on the whole front."" Summerall's actions on November 10–11 resulted in over eleven hundred American casualties. Some have criticized the allied operations in the final days of the war, including those ordered by Summerall, as causing unnecessary loss of life, but they are more understandable in the context of previous failed peace attempts and rumors. Marshal Ferdinand Foch, the Allied Supreme Commander, warned General John Joseph ""Blackjack"" Pershing, Commander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) on the Western Front, on November 5: ""It can happen that the enemy may spread rumors that an armistice is signed in order to deceive us. There is none. Let no one cease hostilities of any sort without information from the Marshal, Commander-In-Chief."" According to historian Niall Ferguson, Major General Summerall was equally capable of issuing orders that violated the laws and customs of war, as when he ordered U.S. Marine Corps officer Elton Mackin, ""Way up there to the north is a railhead... Go cut it for me. And when you cut it, you will go hungry if you try to feed the prisoners you will take... Now I say, and you remember me on this, on those three ridges, take no prisoners."" Later, Summerall commanded IX and IV Corps and served on the American Peace Commission at the Peace Conference in 1919. General John J. Pershing, in a hand-written dedication to the official Report of the First Army, wrote in 1924: ""To Major General Charles P. Summerall, whose loyal and distinguished services as Brigade, Division, and Corps Commander during Allied operations of the American Expedition army forces in the World War will ever remain the pride of his associates and will ever mark him as one of the outstanding figures of that great struggle. Especially will his name be linked with the wonderful achievements of the First Division which exemplifies his character as a soldier and a leader."" Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt Jr. wrote in a letter to future Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall: ""in my humble opinion, General Summerall was the biggest troop leader we had in the American army and you were the best tactician. I have quite often expressed this view to people whom I know and you would be pleased and surprised to know how many agree with me."" General Thomas T. Handy, discussing the impact of ""real leaders"", said ""I remember old man Summerall, 5th Corps, way back in World War I. His personality was felt all the way down through it."" War correspondent Thomas Johnson wrote: ""To command the V Corps in the place of General Cameron, came the epitome of a military leader, daring and careful, ruthless and inspiring, a Christian and a fighter, whose officers and men worshipped him, Major-General Charles P. Summerall of the 1st Division."" He later observes ""Summerall was spiritually a Civil war corps commander, mentally a scientific modern soldier, a twentieth-century Stonewall Jackson. He could deliver an exhortation to make men cry and curse and beg to get at the Germans."" In World War I, Summerall became embittered by General Joseph T. Dickman. During an attempted attack on Sedan in early November 1918, based on misleading orders by General Pershing, Summerall failed to coordinate with Dickman's I Corps and ordered his subordinate, Brigadier General Frank Parker, who had succeeded him in command of the 1st Division, to attack the city. During the attack, Parker's 1st Division entered Dickman's sector and mixed with two of his divisions and a French unit, causing confusion, delays and friendly fire incidents. Although the episode had no relevant military consequences, Gary Nichols reports, that even after Summerall became chief of staff, he attributed all criticism or resistance he encountered to supporters of Dickman, so ""it became almost impossible to criticize him without incurring his wrath."" Summerall commanded the 1st Division in 1919 to 1921, receiving promotion to brigadier general of the regular army in February 1919 and to major general in April 1920. He commanded the Hawaiian Department from August 1921 to August 1924. Colonel William ""Billy"" Mitchell visited Summerall during his command in Hawaii, and criticized the lack of air defenses for the islands. This angered Summerall, who attempted to preside over Mitchell's 1925 court-martial. Summerall testified against Mitchell, who was convicted and sentenced to a five-year suspension from duty. After commanding the Eighth and Second Corps Areas from 1924 to 1926, Summerall was appointed Chief of Staff of the United States Army. He served from 21 November 1926 until 20 November 1930, and was promoted to general in February 1929. During his tenure he directed the formation of a mechanized force and recommended an integrated mobile force of tank, artillery, engineer, and quartermaster elements. In 1927, Summerall joined the South Carolina Society of the Sons of the American Revolution, and he later became its president. Summerall retired from active service in March 1931, and was president of The Citadel from 1931 until 1953. He died in Washington, D.C., on 14 May 1955. Summerall is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. The elite rifle drill team at The Citadel is named The Summerall Guards in his honor. The Citadel's parade field, edged by the cadet barracks and most of the main buildings on campus, is named after him. The Summerall Chapel on the campus of The Citadel, built in 1936, is named for Summerall as well. Summerall Field is the main parade ground on Fort Myer, Virginia, where change of command ceremonies, retirements, the twilight tattoo and other major events are held featuring the 3d Infantry Regiment. General Summerall's military awards include the following – Summerall's received the Distinguished Service Cross as commanding general of the 1st Division. The citation for the award reads: ...for extraordinary heroism in action before Berzy-le-Sec, near Soissons, France, during the Aisne-Marne offensive, July 19, 1918. General Summerall, commanding the 1st Division, visited, with great gallantry and with utter disregard for his own safety, the extreme front lines of his division and personally made a reconnaissance of the position in the face of heavy hostile machine-gun and artillery fire, exhorting his men to renew the attack on Berzy-le-Sec, promising them a powerful artillery support, and so encouraging them by his presence and example that they declared their readiness to take the town for him. Due to his great courage and utter disregard for his own safety, the men of his division were inspired to enormous and heroic efforts, capturing Berzy-le-Sec the next morning under terrific enemy fire, and later in the day the division reached all its objectives. In contrast to the official citation, Colonel Conrad S. Babcock, commander of the 28th Infantry Regiment at Berzy-le-Sec, contended that Summerall was not at the front until after the battle. The only time I saw General Summerall near the front was on the night of the 19th in the Missy-aux-Bois ravine, Ploisy had just been captured. If he exhorted any of the 1st Battalion that evening, after their strenuous and fierce 3,000 yard advance, I was never told of it. The citation for Summerall's Distinguished Service Medal is as follows: War Department, General Order No. 12 (1919) The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Major General Charles Pelot Summerall Sr., United States Army, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I. General Summerall Commanded in turn a Brigade of the 1st Division in the operations near Montdidier, the 1st Division during the Soissons and St. Mihiel offensives and in the early battles of the Meuse-Argonne advance, and the 5th Army Corps in the latter battles of this advance. In all of these important duties his calm courage, his clear judgment, and his soldierly character had a marked influence in the attainment of the successes of his commands.  # denotes interim president",Normal

"The Electoral district of Montagu was a single-member electoral district of the Tasmanian House of Assembly. It covered the West Coast region of Tasmania and its main centre of population was the town of Zeehan. The seat was created out of part of the seat of Cumberland in a redistribution intended to be carried out for the state election, held on 19 December 1893. However, the redistribution had not yet secured royal assent at the time of the election, and Zeehan solicitor Don Urquhart won the Cumberland poll against the incumbent member, Nicholas John Brown. This ended up in the Supreme Court of Tasmania, which voided the election result. When the district of Montagu was proclaimed, a by-election was called for 2 March 1894 which was won by Urquhart, who went on to be the only member for the seat. It was abolished at the 1900 election and replaced with the seats of Lyell, covering the wider West Coast area, and Zeehan, covering only the town. Urquhart successfully transferred to the Zeehan seat. This Australian government-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",Normal

"Mehran Modiri (Persian: مهران مدیری; born 7 April 1967) is an Iranian director, producer, actor and singer. He is considered to be the leading artist in social satire in Iran. His various series, which have been broadcast through IRIB have set records in terms of viewership (an estimated 95% viewership when he is on-air), as well as make him a popular personality among the masses. His artistic career began in his teenage years acting in local plays. He then entered the world of radio and television in the early 1990s, actively writing scripts for and participating in various comedy skits during the annual Norooz comedy television shows broadcast by the IRIB. He achieved real stardom with his creation of Pavarchin (Tiptoeing), in which he won numerous awards for directing and starring in the picture. He tasted success again when he directed and starred in Noghtechin (Ellipsis), and Jayezeye Bozorg (The Grand Prize), which became major hits on television in Iran. Later, he followed Pavarchin's storyline with the making of Shabhaye Barareh which became his most popular television program yet; the show remained incomplete after it was criticized for offending rural people. This resulted in an abrupt end to the show after 92 episodes without completely explaining the Barareh history. He starred in two full-length films and had planned on entering the film industry once again after Shabhaye Barareh was completed. However, he instead produced and released his next project, the television series Baghe Mozaffar. One of his most popular tv series was The man with a thousand faces, broadcast in 2008. Also, his shows have been popular among the Iranians because of expressing the problems of the society in the form of comedy, as he believes this genre has the most effectiveness on people. Modiri has also released a music album and performed in a number of concerts. He is also a veteran of the Iran–Iraq War. In 2009 Modiri was named by Newsweek as one of the 20 people who dominate power and public discourse in Iran. Between 2015 – 2018 Modiri was mostly seen on Nasim TV with his program Dorehami. In order to support the death of Mahsa Amini and the nationwide protests, Mehran Modiri announced by publishing a video on his Instagram that none of the Iranian television channels have the right to publish his image in television advertisements and periodicals. A few days after these events, the Iranian government announced that Mehran Modiri has been banned from leaving the country, however, Iranian news agencies have announced that Mehran has left Iran. An Iranian Twitter user announced that Mehran had left Tehran for the UAE, but his final destination was not Dubai. Mehran Modiri is the last child of a family originally from the city of Arak. He has three older brothers. Modiri was born and raised in a low-income family in the south of Tehran, Iran. He worked in many physical and low-paying jobs as a child and teenager, including carpenter, porter, welder, mechanic, and baker. Mehran Modiri has acted in various TV series. Most of the popularity and fame he has garnered among the people of Iran emanates from his participation in these programs. Mehran Modiri with 7 awards holds the record for most Hafez Awards won by an individual until 2018",Normal

"The Rolyat Hotel, now the Stetson University College of Law, is located in Gulfport, Florida in Pinellas County on the west coast of Florida. In the early 1900s, Gulfport experienced its share of the Great Florida Land Boom, with the development of Pasadena-on-the-Gulf, now called Pasadena Estates. Pasadena Progress was the official newsletter published for the new Pasadena-on-the-Gulf community. This development was designed as a ""residential paradise"", and the Rolyat Hotel was the last phase of construction before the Great Depression hit. Built in 1925, the Hotel Rolyat (Taylor spelled backwards) was named after I.M. Jack Taylor, its owner and the president of Pasadena Estates, also known as ""Handsome Jack"" Taylor. The architectural firm of Kiehnel & Elliott of Miami, Florida designed the Spanish-themed hotel under the direction of project architect Paul Reed. George A. Fuller Construction Company of New York City served as the general contractor and John Wanamaker supplied the furnishings and china. The Rolyat opened January 1, 1926 with celebrities in attendance and champagne flowing in the main fountain. Designed to replicate a Spanish feudal castle with buildings surrounding a central plaza. The main tower was designed to resemble the Torre Del Oro (Tower of Gold) in Seville, Spain. The Rolyat boasted 100 guest rooms on its property of several buildings, towers, fountains and arcades.

"Star Trek is a 2009 American science fiction action film directed by J. J. Abrams and written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. It is the 11th film in the Star Trek franchise, and is also a reboot that features the main characters of the original Star Trek television series portrayed by a new cast, as the first in the rebooted film series. The film follows James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) aboard the USS Enterprise as they combat Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan from their future who threatens the United Federation of Planets. The story takes place in an alternate reality that features both an alternate birth location for James T. Kirk and further alterations in history stemming from the time travel of both Nero and the original series Spock (Leonard Nimoy). The alternate reality was created in an attempt to free the film and the franchise from established continuity constraints while simultaneously preserving original story elements. The idea for a prequel film which would follow the Star Trek characters during their time in Starfleet Academy was discussed by series creator Gene Roddenberry in 1968. The concept resurfaced in the late 1980s, when it was postulated by Harve Bennett as a possible plotline for what would become Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, but it was rejected in favor of other projects by Roddenberry. Following the critical and commercial failure of Star Trek: Nemesis and the cancellation of Star Trek: Enterprise, the franchise's executive producer Rick Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendresen wrote an unproduced film titled Star Trek: The Beginning, which would take place after Enterprise. After the separation of Viacom and CBS Corporation in 2005, former Paramount Pictures president Gail Berman convinced CBS to allow Paramount to produce a new film in the franchise. Orci and Kurtzman were soon approached to write the film, and Abrams was approached to direct it. Kurtzman and Orci used inspiration from novels and graduate school dissertations, as well as the series itself. Principal photography commenced on November 7, 2007, and ended on March 27, 2008. The film was shot in locations around California and Utah. Abrams wanted to avoid using bluescreen and greenscreen, opting to use sets and locations instead. Heavy secrecy surrounded the film's production and was under the fake working title Corporate Headquarters. Industrial Light & Magic used digital ships for the film, as opposed to miniatures used in most of the previous films in the franchise. Production for the film concluded by the end of 2008. Star Trek was heavily promoted in the months preceding its release; pre-release screenings for the film premiered in select cities around the world, including Austin, Texas, Sydney, Australia, and Calgary, Alberta. It was released in the United States and Canada on May 8, 2009, to critical acclaim. The film was a box office success, grossing over $385.7 million worldwide against its $150 million production budget. It was nominated for several awards, including four Academy Awards at the 82nd Academy Awards, ultimately winning Best Makeup, making it the first (and to date only) Star Trek film to win an Academy Award. It was followed by the sequels Star Trek Into Darkness and Star Trek Beyond in 2013 and 2016, respectively. In 2233, the Federation starship USS Kelvin investigates a ""lightning storm"" in space. A Romulan ship, Narada, emerges from the storm and attacks the Kelvin, then demands that Kelvin's Captain Robau come aboard to negotiate a truce. Robau is questioned about the current stardate and an ""Ambassador Spock"", whom he does not recognize. Narada's commander, Nero, kills him, and resumes attacking the Kelvin. George Kirk, Kelvin's first officer, orders the ship's personnel, including his pregnant wife Winona, to abandon ship while he pilots the Kelvin on a collision course with Narada, since the Kelvin's autopilot is disabled. Kirk sacrifices his life to ensure Winona's survival as she gives birth to James Tiberius Kirk. Seventeen years later on the planet Vulcan, a young Spock is admitted to the Vulcan Science Academy. Realizing that the Academy views his human mother, Amanda, as a ""disadvantage"", he joins Starfleet instead. On Earth, Kirk becomes a reckless but intelligent adult. Following a bar fight with Starfleet cadets accompanying Nyota Uhura, Kirk meets Captain Christopher Pike, who encourages him to enlist in Starfleet Academy, where Kirk meets and befriends doctor Leonard McCoy. Three years later, Commander Spock accuses Kirk of cheating during the Kobayashi Maru simulation. Kirk argues that cheating was acceptable because the simulation was designed to be unbeatable. The disciplinary hearing is interrupted by a distress signal from Vulcan. With the primary fleet out of range, the cadets are mobilized. McCoy and Kirk board Pike's ship, the Enterprise. Realizing that the ""lightning storm"" observed near Vulcan is similar to the one that occurred when he was born, Kirk convinces Pike that the distress signal is a trap. When the Enterprise arrives, they find the fleet destroyed and Narada drilling into Vulcan's core. Narada attacks Enterprise and Pike surrenders, delegating command of the ship to Spock and promoting Kirk to first officer. Kirk, Hikaru Sulu, and Chief Engineer Olson perform a space jump onto the drilling platform. While Olson is killed mid-jump, Kirk and Sulu disable the drill, but are unable to stop Nero launching ""red matter"" into Vulcan's core, forming an artificial black hole that destroys Vulcan. The Enterprise rescues Spock's father, Sarek, and the high council before the planet's destruction, but Amanda falls to her death before the transporter can lock onto her. As Narada approaches Earth, Nero tortures Pike to gain access to Earth's defense codes. Spock maroons Kirk on Delta Vega after he attempts mutiny. On the planet, Kirk encounters an older Spock from an alternate timeline, who explains that he and Nero are from 2387. In the future, Romulus was threatened by a supernova, which Spock attempted to stop with red matter. His plan failed, resulting in Nero's family perishing along with Romulus, while the Narada and Spock's vessel were caught in the black hole and sent back in time. They were sent back 25 years apart, during which time Nero attacked the Kelvin, changing history and creating a parallel universe. After Spock's arrival, Nero stranded him on Delta Vega to watch Vulcan's destruction. Reaching a Starfleet outpost, Kirk and the elder Spock meet Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott, who devises a trans-warp transporter system, allowing him and Kirk to beam onto Enterprise. Following the elder Spock's advice, Kirk provokes younger Spock into attacking him, forcing Spock to recognize himself as emotionally compromised and relinquish command to Kirk. After talking with Sarek, Spock decides to help Kirk. While Enterprise hides within the gas clouds of Titan, Kirk and Spock beam aboard Narada. Kirk fights Nero and rescues Pike, while Spock uses the elder Spock's ship to destroy the drill. Spock leads Narada away from Earth and sets his ship to collide with Narada. Enterprise beams Kirk, Pike, and Spock aboard. The older Spock's ship and Narada collide, igniting the red matter. Narada is consumed in a black hole that Enterprise barely escapes. Kirk is promoted to captain and given command of Enterprise, while Pike is promoted to rear admiral. Spock encounters his older self, who persuades his younger self to continue serving in Starfleet, encouraging him to do what feels right rather than what is logical. Spock becomes first officer under Kirk's command. Enterprise goes to warp as the elder Spock speaks the ""where no one has gone before"" monologue. Chris Doohan, the son of the original Scotty, James Doohan, makes a cameo appearance in the transporter room. Pegg e-mailed Doohan about the role of Scotty, and the actor has promised him his performance ""would be a complete tribute to his father"". Chris Doohan previously cameoed in Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Greg Grunberg has a vocal cameo as Kirk's alcoholic stepfather. Grunberg was up for the role of Olson but dropped out due to a scheduling conflict. Grunberg was also interested in playing Harry Mudd, who was in an early draft of the script. Brad William Henke filmed scenes in the role which were cut out. Diora Baird appears in a deleted scene as an Orion cadet that Kirk mistakes for Gaila. Star Trek: Enterprise star Dominic Keating also auditioned for the role. Paul McGillion auditioned for Scotty, and he impressed producers enough that he was given another role as a 'Barracks Leader'. James Cawley, producer and star of the webseries Star Trek: New Voyages, appears as a Starfleet officer, while Pavel Lychnikoff and Lucia Rijker play Romulans, Lychnikoff a Commander and Rijker a CO. W. Morgan Sheppard, who played a Klingon in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, appears in this film as the head of the Vulcan Science Council. Wil Wheaton, known for portraying Wesley Crusher on Star Trek: The Next Generation, was brought in, through urging by Greg Grunberg, to voice several of the other Romulans in the film. Star Trek fan and Carnegie Mellon University professor Randy Pausch (who died on July 25, 2008) cameoed as a Kelvin crew member, and has a line of dialogue. Majel Barrett, the widow of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, reprised her role as the voice of the Enterprise's computer, which she completed two weeks before her death on December 18, 2008. The film was dedicated to her, as well as Gene, to whom the film was always going to be commemorated as a sign of respect. Orci and Kurtzman wrote a scene for William Shatner, where old Spock gives his younger self a recorded message by Kirk from the previous timeline. ""It was basically a Happy Birthday wish knowing that Spock was going to go off to Romulus, and Kirk would probably be dead by the time,"" and it would have transitioned into Shatner reciting ""where no man has gone before"". But Shatner wanted to share Nimoy's major role, and did not want a cameo, despite his character's death in Star Trek Generations. He suggested the film canonize his novels where Kirk is resurrected, but Abrams decided if his character was accompanying Nimoy's, it would have become a film about the resurrection of Kirk, and not about introducing the new versions of the characters. Nimoy disliked the character's death in Generations, but felt resurrecting Kirk would also be detrimental to this film. Nichelle Nichols suggested playing Uhura's grandmother, but Abrams could not write this in due to the Writers Guild strike. Abrams was also interested in casting Keri Russell, but they deemed the role he had in mind for her too similar to her other roles. As early as the 1968 World Science Fiction Convention, Star Trek creator Roddenberry had said he was going to make a film prequel to the television series. But the prequel concept did not resurface until the late 1980s, when Ralph Winter and Harve Bennett submitted a proposal for a prequel during development of the fourth film. Roddenberry rejected Bennett's prequel proposal in 1991, after the completion of Star Trek V: The Final Frontier. Then David Loughery wrote a script entitled The Academy Years, but it was shelved in light of objections from Roddenberry and the fanbase. The film that was commissioned instead ended up being Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. In February 2005, after the financial failure of the tenth film, Star Trek: Nemesis (2002), and the cancellation of the television series Star Trek: Enterprise, the franchise's executive producer Rick Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendresen began developing a new film entitled Star Trek: The Beginning. It was to revolve around a new set of characters, led by Kirk's ancestor Tiberius Chase, and be set during the Earth-Romulan War—after the events of Enterprise but before the events of the original series. In 2005, Viacom, which owned Paramount Pictures, separated from CBS Corporation, which retained Paramount's television properties, including ownership of the Star Trek brand. Gail Berman (no relation to executive producer Rick Berman), then president of Paramount, convinced CBS' chief executive, Leslie Moonves, to allow them eighteen months to develop a new Star Trek film, otherwise Paramount would lose the film rights. Berman approached Mission: Impossible III writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman for ideas on the new film, and after the film had completed shooting she asked their director, Abrams, to produce it. Abrams, Orci, and Kurtzman, plus producers Damon Lindelof and Bryan Burk, felt the franchise had explored enough of what took place after the series, Orci and Lindelof consider themselves trekkies, and feel some of the Star Trek novels have canonical value, although Roddenberry never considered the novels to be canon. Kurtzman is a casual fan, while Burk was not. Abrams' company Bad Robot Productions produced the film with Paramount, marking the first time another company had financed a Star Trek film. Bill Todman, Jr.'s Level 1 Entertainment also co-produced the film, but, during 2008, Spyglass Entertainment replaced them as financial partner. In an interview, Abrams said that he had never seen Star Trek: Nemesis because he felt the franchise had ""disconnected"" from the original series. For him, he said, Star Trek was about Kirk and Spock, and the other series were like ""separate space adventure with the name Star Trek"". He also acknowledged that as a child he had actually preferred the Star Wars movies. He noted that his general knowledge of Star Trek made him well suited to introduce the franchise to newcomers, and that, being an optimistic person, he would make Star Trek an optimistic film, which would be a refreshing contrast to the likes of The Dark Knight. He added that he loved the focus on exploration in Star Trek and the idea of the Prime Directive, which forbids Starfleet to interfere in the development of primitive worlds, but that, because of the budgetary limitations of the original series, it had ""never had the resources to actually show the adventure"". He noted he only became involved with the project as producer initially because he wanted to help Orci, Kurtzman, and Lindelof. On February 23, 2007, Abrams accepted Paramount's offer to direct the film, after having initially been attached to it solely as a producer. He explained that he had decided to direct the film because, after reading the script, he realized that he ""would be so agonizingly envious of whoever stepped in and directed the movie"". Orci and Kurtzman said that their aim had been to impress a casual fan like Abrams with their story. Abrams noted that, during filming, he had been nervous ""with all these tattooed faces and pointy ears, bizarre weaponry and Romulan linguists, with dialogue about 'Neutral Zones' and 'Starfleet'  I knew this would work, because the script Alex and Bob wrote was so emotional and so relatable. I didn't love Kirk and Spock when I began this journey – but I love them now."" ""We're from different worlds, Alex  was born here, and I was born in Mexico City and lived there until I was nine. Kirk and Spock are opposites from two worlds. That's us in a nutshell. We're drawn to each by what each of us lacks. The story of this film is about two guys who are such opposites that they might end up strangling each other but instead they bond and thrive together. That's us. We can go warp speed together."" Roberto Orci on the film's emotional context. Orci said getting Leonard Nimoy in the film was important. ""Having him sitting around a campfire sharing his memories was never gonna cut it"" though, and time travel was going to be included in the film from the beginning. Kurtzman added, saying the time travel creates jeopardy, unlike other prequels where viewers ""know how they all died"". The writers acknowledged time travel had been overused in the other series, but it served a good purpose in creating a new set of adventures for the original characters before they could completely do away with it in other films. Abrams selected the Romulans as the villains because they had been featured less than the Klingons in the series and thought it would be ""fun"" to have them meet Kirk before they do in the series. Orci and Kurtzman noted it would feel backward to demonize the Klingons again after they had become heroes in later Star Trek series, and the Romulan presence continues Spock's story from his last chronological appearance in ""Unification"", an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation set in 2368. The episode of the original continuity in which Kirk becomes one of the first humans to ever see a Romulan, ""Balance of Terror"", served as one of the influences for the film. Orci said it was difficult giving a good explanation for the time travel without being gimmicky, like having Nero specifically seeking to assassinate Kirk. Orci noted while the time travel story allowed them to alter some backstory elements such as Kirk's first encounter with the Romulans, they could not use it as a crutch to change everything and tried to approach the film as a prequel as much as possible. Kirk's service on Farragut, a major backstory point to the original episode ""Obsession"", was left out because it was deemed irrelevant to the story of Kirk meeting Spock, although Orci felt nothing in his script precluded it from the new film's backstory. There was a scene involving Kirk meeting Carol Marcus (who is revealed as the mother of his son in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan) as a child, but it was dropped because the film needed more time to introduce the core characters. Figuring out ways to get the crew together required some contrivances, which Orci and Kurtzman wanted to explain from old Spock as a way of the timeline mending itself, highlighting the theme of destiny. The line was difficult to write and was ultimately cut out. The filmmakers sought inspiration from novels such as Prime Directive, Spock's World and Best Destiny to fill in gaps unexplained by canon; Best Destiny particularly explores Kirk's childhood and names his parents. One idea that was justified through information from the novels was having Enterprise built on Earth, which was inspired by a piece of fan art of Enterprise being built in a shipyard. Orci had sent the fan art to Abrams to show how realistic the film could be. Orci explained parts of the ship would have to be constructed on Earth because of the artificial gravity employed on the ship and its requirement for sustaining warp speed, and therefore the calibration of the ship's machinery would be best done in the exact gravity well which is to be simulated. They felt free to have the ship built in Iowa because canon is ambiguous as to whether it was built in San Francisco, but this is a result of the time travel rather than something intended to overlap with the original timeline. Abrams noted the continuity of the original series itself was inconsistent at times. Orci and Kurtzman said they wanted the general audience to like the film as much as the fans, by stripping away ""Treknobabble,"" making it action-packed and giving it the simple title of Star Trek to indicate to newcomers they would not need to watch any of the other films. Abrams saw humor and sex appeal as two integral and popular elements of the show that needed to be maintained. Orci stated being realistic and being serious were not the same thing. Abrams, Burk, Lindelof, Orci and Kurtzman were fans of The Wrath of Khan, and also cited The Next Generation episode ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" as an influence. Abrams' wife Katie was regularly consulted on the script, as were Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof's wives, to make the female characters as strong as possible. Katie Abrams' approval of the strong female characters was partly why Abrams signed on to direct. Orci and Kurtzman read graduate school dissertations on the series for inspiration; they noted comparisons of Kirk, Spock and McCoy to Shakespearian archetypes, and Kirk and Spock's friendship echoing that of John Lennon and Paul McCartney. They also noted that, in the creation of this film, they were influenced by Star Wars, particularly in pacing. ""I want to feel the space, I want to feel speed and I want to feel all the things that can become a little bit lost when Star Trek becomes very stately"" said Orci. Star Wars permeated in the way they wrote the action sequences, while Burk noted Kirk and Spock's initially cold relationship mirrors how ""Han Solo wasn't friends with anyone when they started on their journey."" Spock and Uhura were put in an actual relationship as a nod to early episodes highlighting her interest in him. Orci wanted to introduce strong Starfleet captains, concurring with an interviewer that most captains in other films were ""patsies"" included to make Kirk look greater by comparison. USS Kelvin, the ship Kirk's father serves on, is named after J.J. Abrams' grandfather, as well as the physicist and engineer Lord Kelvin (William Thomson). Kelvin's captain, Richard Robau (Faran Tahir), is named after Orci's Cuban uncle: Orci theorized the fictional character was born in Cuba and grew up in the Middle East. Another reference to Abrams' previous works is Slusho, which Uhura orders at the bar where she meets Kirk. Abrams created the fictitious drink for Alias and it reappeared in viral marketing for Cloverfield. Its owner, Tagruato, is also from Cloverfield and appears on a building in San Francisco. The red matter in the film is in the shape of a red ball, an Abrams motif dating back to the pilot of Alias. The film's production designer was Scott Chambliss, a longtime collaborator with Abrams. Chambliss worked with a large group of concept illustrators, including James Clyne, Ryan Church, creature designer Neville Page, and Star Trek veteran John Eaves. Abrams stated the difficulty of depicting the future was that much of modern technology was inspired by the original show, and made it seem outdated. Thus the production design had to be consistent with the television series but also feel more advanced than the real world technology developed after it. ""We all have the iPhone that does more than the communicator,"" said Abrams. ""I feel like there's a certain thing that you can't really hold onto, which is kind of the kitschy quality. That must go if it's going to be something that you believe is real."" Prop master Russell Bobbitt collaborated with Nokia on recreating the original communicator, creating a $50,000 prototype. Another prop recreated for the film was the tricorder. Bobbitt brought the original prop to the set, but the actors found it too large to carry when filming action scenes, so technical advisor Doug Brody redesigned it to be smaller. The phaser props were designed as spring-triggered barrels that revolve and glow as the setting switches from ""stun"" to ""kill"". An Aptera Typ-1 prototype car was used on location. Production designer Scott Chambliss maintained the layout of the original bridge, but aesthetically altered it with brighter colors to reflect the optimism of Star Trek. The viewscreen was made into a window that could have images projected on it to make the space environment palpable. Abrams compared the redesign to the sleek modernist work of Pierre Cardin and the sets from 2001: A Space Odyssey, which were from the 1960s. He joked the redesigned bridge made the Apple Store look ""uncool"". At the director's behest, more railings were added to the bridge to make it look safer, and the set was built on gimbals so its rocking motions when the ship accelerates and is attacked was more realistic. To emphasize the size of the ship, Abrams chose to give the engine room a highly industrial appearance: he explained to Pegg that he was inspired by RMSTitanic, a sleek ship in which there was an ""incredible gut"". Abrams selected Michael Kaplan to design the costumes because he had not seen any of the films, meaning he would approach the costumes with a new angle. For the Starfleet uniforms, Kaplan followed the show's original color-coding, with dark gray (almost black) undershirts and pants and colored overshirts showing each crew member's position. Command officers wear gold shirts, science and medical officers wear blue, and operations (technicians, engineers, and security personnel) wear red. Kaplan wanted the shirts to be more sophisticated than the originals and selected to have the Starfleet symbol patterned on them. Kirk wears only the undershirt because he is a cadet. Kaplan modelled the uniforms on Kelvin on science fiction films of the 1940s and 1950s, to contrast with Enterprise-era uniforms based on the ones created in the 1960s. For Abrams, ""The costumes were a microcosm of the entire project, which was how to take something that's kind of silly and make it feel real. But how do you make legitimate those near-primary color costumes?"" Lindelof compared the film's Romulan faction to pirates with their bald, tattooed heads and disorganized costuming. Their ship, Narada, is purely practical with visible mechanics as it is a ""working ship"", unlike the Enterprise crew who give a respectable presentation on behalf of the Federation. Chambliss was heavily influenced by the architecture of Antoni Gaudí for Narada, who created buildings that appeared to be inside out: by making the ship's exposed wires appear like bones or ligaments, it would create a foreboding atmosphere. The ship's interior was made of six pieces that could be rearranged to create a different room. The Romulan actors had three prosthetics applied to their ears and foreheads, while Bana had a fourth prosthetic for the bitemark on his ear that extends to the back of his character's head. The film's Romulans lack the V-shaped ridges on the foreheads, which had been present in all of their depictions outside the original series. Neville Page wanted to honor that by having Nero's crew ritually scar themselves too, forming keloids reminiscent of the 'V'-ridges. It was abandoned as they did not pursue the idea enough. Kaplan wanted aged, worn, and rugged clothes for the Romulans because of their mining backgrounds and found some greasy looking fabrics at a flea market. Kaplan tracked down the makers of those clothes, who were discovered to be based in Bali, and commissioned them to create his designs. Barney Burman supervised the makeup for the other aliens: his team had to rush the creation of many of the aliens, because originally the majority of them were to feature in one scene towards the end of filming. Abrams deemed the scene too similar to the cantina sequence in Star Wars and decided to dot the designs around the film. A tribble was placed in the background of Scotty's introduction. Both digital and physical makeup was used for aliens. Principal photography for the film began on November 7, 2007, and culminated on March 27, 2008; however second unit filming occurred in Bakersfield, California, in April 2008, which stood in for Kirk's childhood home in Iowa. Filming was also done at the City Hall of Long Beach, California; the San Rafael Swell in Utah; and the California State University, Northridge in Los Angeles (which was used for establishing shots of students at Starfleet Academy). A parking lot outside Dodger Stadium was used for the ice planet of Delta Vega and the Romulan drilling rig on Vulcan. The filmmakers expressed an interest in Iceland for scenes on Delta Vega, but decided against it: Chambliss enjoyed the challenge of filming scenes with snow in southern California. Other Vulcan exteriors were shot at Vasquez Rocks, a location that was used in various episodes of the original series. A Budweiser plant in Van Nuys was used for Enterprise's engine room, while a Long Beach power plant was used for Kelvin's engine room. Following the initiation of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike on November 5, 2007, Abrams, himself a WGA member, told Variety that while he would not render writing services for the film and intended to walk the picket line, he did not expect the strike to impact his directing of the production. In the final few weeks before the strike and start of production, Abrams and Lindelof polished the script for a final time. Abrams was frustrated that he was unable to alter lines during the strike, whereas normally they would have been able to improvise new ideas during rehearsal, although Lindelof acknowledged they could dub some lines in post-production. Orci and Kurtzman were able to stay on set without strikebreaking because they were also executive producers on the film; they could ""make funny eyes and faces at the actors whenever they had a problem with the line and sort of nod when they had something better"". Abrams was able to alter a scene where Spock combats six Romulans from a fistfight to a gunfight, having decided there were too many physical brawls in the film. The production team maintained heavily enforced security around the film. Karl Urban revealed, "" level of security and secrecy that we have all been forced to adopt. I mean, it's really kind of paranoid crazy, but sort of justified. We're not allowed to walk around in public in our costumes and we have to be herded around everywhere in these golf carts that are completely concealed and covered in black canvas. The security of it is immense. You feel your freedom is a big challenge."" Actors like Jennifer Morrison were only given the scripts of their scenes. The film's shooting script was fiercely protected even with the main cast. Simon Pegg said, ""I read  with a security guard near me – it's that secretive."" The film used the fake working title of Corporate Headquarters. Some of the few outside of the production allowed to visit the set included Rod Roddenberry, Ronald D. Moore, Jonathan Frakes, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, Ben Stiller, Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg (who had partially convinced Abrams to direct because he liked the script, and he even advised the action scenes during his visit). When the shoot ended, Abrams gave the cast small boxes containing little telescopes, which allowed them to read the name of each constellation it was pointed at. ""I think he just wanted each of us to look at the stars a little differently,"" said John Cho. After the shoot, Abrams cut out some scenes of Kirk and Spock as children, including seeing the latter as a baby, as well as a subplot involving Nero being imprisoned by the Klingons and his escape: this explanation for his absence during Kirk's life confused many to whom Abrams screened the film. Other scenes cut out explained that the teenage Kirk stole his stepfather's antique car because he had forced him to clean it before an auction; and that the Orion he seduced at the Academy worked in the operations division. Afterward, she agrees to open the e-mail containing his patch that allows him to pass the Kobayashi Maru test. Abrams chose to shoot the film in the anamorphic format on 35mm film after discussions about whether the film should be shot in high-definition digital video. Cinematographer Dan Mindel and Abrams agreed the choice gave the film a big-screen feel and the realistic, organic look they wanted for the film setting. Abrams and Mindel used lens flares throughout filming to create an optimistic atmosphere and a feeling that activity was taking place off-camera, making the Star Trek universe feel more real. ""There's something about those flares, especially in a movie that potentially could be incredibly sterile and CG and overly controlled. There's just something incredibly unpredictable and gorgeous about them."" Mindel would create more flares by shining a flashlight or pointing a mirror at the camera lens, or using two cameras simultaneously and therefore two lighting set-ups. Editor Mary Jo Markey later said in an interview that he had not told her (or fellow editor Maryann Brandon) this, and initially contacted the film developers asking why the film seemed overexposed. Industrial Light & Magic and Digital Domain were among several companies that created over 1,000 special effect shots. The visual effects supervisors were Roger Guyett, who collaborated with Abrams on Mission: Impossible III and also served as second unit director, and Russell Earl. Abrams avoided shooting only against bluescreen and greenscreen, because it ""makes me insane"", using them instead to extend the scale of sets and locations. The Delta Vega sequence required the mixing of digital snow with real snow. Star Trek was the first film ILM worked on using entirely digital ships. Enterprise was intended by Abrams to be a merging of its design in the series and the refitted version from the original film. Abrams had fond memories of the revelation of Enterprise's refit in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, because it was the first time the ship felt tangible and real to him. The iridescent pattern on the ship from The Motion Picture was maintained to give the ship depth, while model maker Roger Goodson also applied the ""Aztec"" pattern from The Next Generation. Goodson recalled Abrams also wanted to bring a ""hot rod"" aesthetic to the ship. Effects supervisor Roger Guyett wanted the ship to have more moving parts, which stemmed from his childhood dissatisfaction with the ship's design: The new Enterprise's dish can expand and move, while the fins on its engines split slightly when they begin warping. Enterprise was originally redesigned by Ryan Church using features of the original, at 1,200 feet (370m) long, but was doubled in size to 2,357 feet (718m) long to make it seem ""grander"", while the Romulan Narada is five miles long and several miles wide. The filmmakers had to simulate lens flares on the ships in keeping with the film's cinematography. Carolyn Porco of NASA was consulted on the planetary science and imagery. The animators realistically recreated what an explosion would look like in space: short blasts, which suck inward and leave debris from a ship floating. For shots of an imploding planet, the same explosion program was used to simulate it breaking up, while the animators could manually composite multiple layers of rocks and wind sucking into the planet. Unlike other Star Trek films and series, the transporter beam effects swirl rather than speckle. Abrams conceived the redesign to emphasize the notion of transporters as beams that can pick up and move people, rather than a signal composed of scrambled atoms. Lola Visual Effects worked on 48 shots, including some animation to Bana and Nimoy. Bana required extensive damage to his teeth, which was significant enough to completely replace his mouth in some shots. Nimoy's mouth was reanimated in his first scene with Kirk following a rerecording session. The filmmakers had filmed Nimoy when he rerecorded his lines so they could rotoscope his mouth into the film, even recreating the lighting conditions, but they realized they had to digitally recreate his lips because of the bouncing light created by the camp fire. The sound effects were designed by Star Wars veteran Ben Burtt. Whereas the phaser blast noises from the television series were derived from The War of the Worlds (1953), Burtt made his phaser sounds more like his blasters from Star Wars, because Abrams' depiction of phasers were closer to the blasters' bullet-like fire, rather than the steady beams of energy in previous Star Trek films. Burtt reproduced the classic photon torpedo and warp drive sounds: he tapped a long spring against a contact microphone, and combined that with cannon fire. Burtt used a 1960s oscillator to create a musical and emotional hum to the warping and transporting sounds. Michael Giacchino, Abrams' most frequent collaborator, composed the music for Star Trek. He kept the original theme by Alexander Courage for the end credits, which Abrams said symbolized the momentum of the crew coming together. Giacchino admitted personal pressure in scoring the film, as ""I grew up listening to all of that great  music, and that's part of what inspired me to do what I'm doing  You just go in scared. You just hope you do your best. It's one of those things where the film will tell me what to do."" Scoring took place at the Sony Scoring Stage with a 107-piece orchestra and 40-person choir. An erhu, performed by Karen Han, was used for the Vulcan themes. A distorted recording was used for the Romulans. Varèse Sarabande, the record label responsible for releasing albums of Giacchino's previous scores for Alias, Lost, Mission: Impossible III, and Speed Racer, released the soundtrack for the film on May 5. The music for the theatrical trailers were composed by Two Steps from Hell. The first teaser trailer debuted in theaters with Cloverfield on January 18, 2008, which showed Enterprise under construction. Abrams himself directed the first part of the trailer, where a welder removes his goggles. Professional welders were hired for the teaser. The voices of the 1960s played over the trailer were intended to link the film to the present day; John F. Kennedy in particular was chosen because of similarities with the character of James T. Kirk and because he is seen to have ""kicked off"" the Space Race. Orci explained that: ""If we do indeed have a Federation, I think Kennedy's words will be inscribed in there someplace."" Star Trek's later trailers would win four awards, including Best in Show, in the tenth annual Golden Trailer Awards. Paramount faced two obstacles in promoting the film: the unfamiliarity of the ""MySpace generation"" with the franchise and the relatively weak international performance of the previous films. Six months before the film's release, Abrams toured Europe and North America with 25 minutes of footage. Abrams noted the large-scale campaign started unusually early, but this was because the release delay allowed him to show more completed scenes than normal. The director preferred promoting his projects quietly, but concurred Paramount needed to remove Star Trek's stigma. Abrams would exaggerate his preference for other shows to Star Trek as a child to the press, with statements like ""I'm not a Star Trek fan"" and ""this movie is not made for Star Trek fans necessarily"". Orci compared Abrams' approach to The Next Generation episode ""A Matter of Honor"", where William Riker is stationed aboard a Klingon vessel. ""On that ship when someone talks back to you, you would have to beat them down or you lose the respect of your crew, which is protocol, whereas on a Federation ship that would be a crime. So we have to give  a little bit of leeway, when he is traveling the 'galaxy' over there where they don't know Trek, to say the things that need to be said in order to get people onto our side."" Promotional partners on the film include Nokia, Verizon Wireless, Esurance, Kellogg's, Burger King and Intel Corporation, as well as various companies specializing in home decorating, apparel, jewelry, gift items and ""Tiberius"", ""Pon Farr"" and ""Red Shirt"" fragrances. Playmates Toys, who owned the Star Trek toy license until 2000, also held the merchandise rights for the new film. The first wave was released in March and April 2009. Playmates hope to continue their toy line into 2010. The first wave consists of 3.75"", 6"" and 12"" action figures, an Enterprise replica, prop toys and play sets. to recreate the whole bridge, one would have to buy more 3.75"" figures, which come with chairs and consoles to add to the main set consisting of Kirk's chair, the floor, the main console and the viewscreen. Master Replicas, Mattel, Hasbro and Fundex Games will promote the film via playing cards, Monopoly, UNO, Scrabble, Magic 8-Ball, Hot Wheels, Tyco RC, 20Q, Scene It? and Barbie lines. Some of these are based on previous Star Trek iterations rather than the film. CBS also created a merchandising line based around Star Trek caricatures named ""Quogs"". In February 2008, Paramount announced they would move Star Trek from its December 25, 2008, release date to May 8, 2009, as the studio felt more people would see the film during summer than winter. The film was practically finished by the end of 2008. Paramount's decision came about after visiting the set and watching dailies, as they realized the film could appeal to a much broader audience. Even though the filmmakers liked the Christmas release date, Damon Lindelof acknowledged it would allow more time to perfect the visual effects. The months-long gap between the completion of the production and release meant Alan Dean Foster was allowed to watch the whole film before writing the novelization, although the novel would contain scenes absent from the final edit. Quinto narrated the audiobook. A surprise public screening was held on April 6, 2009, at the Alamo Drafthouse theater in Austin, Texas, hosted by writers Robert Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and producer Damon Lindelof. The showing was publicized as a screening of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, followed by a ten-minute preview of the new Star Trek film. A few minutes into Khan, the film appeared to melt and Nimoy appeared on stage with Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof, asking the audience, ""wouldn't you rather see the new movie?"" Following the surprise screening in Texas, the first of many premieres across the world was held at the Sydney Opera House in Sydney on April 7, 2009. For almost two years, the town of Vulcan, Alberta had campaigned to have the film premiere there, but because it had no theater, Paramount arranged instead a lottery where 300 winning residents would be taken to a prerelease screening in Calgary. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 17, 2009, in North America, November 16 in the United Kingdom and October 26 in Australia and New Zealand. In Sweden and Germany, it was released on November 4. First week sales stood at 5.7 million DVDs along with 1.1 million Blu-ray Discs, giving Paramount Pictures their third chart topping release in five weeks following Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. Official screenings in the United States started at 7pm on May 7, 2009, grossing $4 million on its opening day. By the end of the weekend, Star Trek had opened with $79,204,300, as well as $35,500,000 from other countries. Adjusted and unadjusted for inflation, it beat Star Trek: First Contact for the largest American opening for a Star Trek film. The film made US$8.5 million from its IMAX screenings, breaking The Dark Knight's $6.3 million IMAX opening record. The film is the highest-grossing in the United States and Canada from the entire Star Trek film franchise, eclipsing The Voyage Home and Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Its opening weekend numbers alone outgross the entire individual runs of The Undiscovered Country, The Final Frontier, Insurrection and Nemesis. Star Trek ended its United States theatrical run on October 1, 2009, with a box office total of $257,730,019, which places it as the seventh highest-grossing film for 2009 behind The Hangover. The film grossed $127,764,536 in international markets, for a total worldwide gross of $385,494,555. While foreign grosses represent only 31% of the total box office receipts, executives of Paramount were happy with the international sales, as Star Trek historically was a movie franchise that never has been a big draw overseas. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of 355 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.110. The website's consensus reads: ""Star Trek reignites a classic franchise with action, humor, a strong story, and brilliant visuals, and will please traditional Trekkies and new fans alike."" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 82 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale. Ty Burr of the Boston Globe gave the film a perfect four star rating, describing it as ""ridiculously satisfying"", and the ""best prequel ever"". Burr praised the character development in the film, opining that ""emotionally, Star Trek hits every one of its marks, functioning as a family reunion that extends across decades, entertainment mediums, even blurring the line between audience and show."" He continued: ""Trading on affections sustained over 40 years of popular culture, Star Trek does what a franchise reboot rarely does. It reminds us why we loved these characters in the first place."" Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an 'A−' grade, commenting that director Abrams ""crafts an origin story that avoids any hint of the origin doldrums"". Similar sentiments were expressed by Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, who gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars. He felt that the acting from the cast was the highlight of the filming, asserting that the performance of Pine radiated star quality. Likewise, Travers called Quinto's performance ""sharp"" and ""intuitive"", and felt that Quinto ""gave the film a soul"". Manohla Dargis of the New York Times wrote, ""Star Trek  isn't just a pleasurable rethink of your geek uncle's favorite science-fiction series. It's also a testament to television's power as mythmaker, as a source for some of the fundamental stories we tell about ourselves, who we are and where we came from. Slate's Dana Stevens felt that the film was ""a gift to those of us who loved the original series, that brainy, wonky, idealistic body of work that aired to almost no commercial success between 1966–69 and has since become a science fiction archetype and object of cult adoration"". Time Out London's Tom Huddleston praised the aesthetic qualities of the film, such as the design of Enterprise, and praised the performances of the cast. He wrote, ""The cast are equally strong: Quinto brings wry charm to an otherwise calculating character, while Pine powers through his performance in bullish, if not quite Shatner-esque, fashion."" The chemistry between Pine and Quinto was well received by critics. Gleiberman felt that as the film progressed to the conclusion, Pine and Quinto emulated the same connection as Kirk and Spock. Tim Robey of The Telegraph echoed similar attitudes; ""The movie charts their relationship  in a nicely oblique way."" Robey resumed: ""It's the main event, dramatically speaking, but there's always something more thumpingly urgent to command their attention, whether it's a Vulcan distress signal or the continuing rampages of those pesky Romulans."" Burr opined that Abrams had an accurate understanding of the relationship between Kirk and Spock, and wrote, ""Pine makes a fine, brash boy Kirk, but Quinto's Spock is something special – an eerily calm figure freighted with a heavier sadness than Roddenberry's original. The two ground each other and point toward all the stories yet to come."" Similarly, The Guardian writer Peter Bradshaw expressed: ""The story of Kirk and Spock is brought thrillingly back to life by a new first generation: Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, who give inspired, utterly unselfconscious and lovable performances, with power, passion and some cracking comic timing."" Some film critics were polarized on Star Trek. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the film a 'B+' grade, and asserted that it was ""a reconsideration of what constitutes Star Trek, one that deemphasizes heady concepts and plainly stated humanist virtues in favor of breathless action punctuated by bursts of emotion. It might not even be immediately recognizable to veteran fans."" In concurrence, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that ""the Gene Roddenberry years, when stories might play with questions of science, ideals or philosophy, have been replaced by stories reduced to loud and colorful action."" Ebert ultimately gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars. Similarly, Marc Bain of Newsweek opined: ""The latest film version of Star Trek  is more brawn than brain, and it largely jettisons complicated ethical conundrums in favor of action sequences and special effects."" Slate journalist Juliet Lapidos argued that the new film, with its ""standard Hollywood torture scene"", failed to live up to the intellectual standard set by the 1992 Next Generation episode ""Chain of Command"", whose treatment of the issue she found both more sophisticated and pertinent to the ongoing debate over the United States' use of enhanced interrogation techniques. A 2018 article by Io9Gizmodo ranked all 11 versions of the USS Enterprise seen in the Star Trek franchise up to that point. The version seen in the film placed in the second lowest position. The film garnered numerous accolades after its release. In 2010, it was nominated for four Academy Awards at the 82nd Academy Awards, for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, and Best Makeup. Star Trek won in the category for Best Makeup, making it the first Star Trek film to receive an Academy Award. The film was nominated for three Empire Awards, to which it won for Best Sci-FiFantasy. In October 2009, Star Trek won the Hollywood Award for Best Movie, and attained six Scream Awards at the 2009 Scream Awards Ceremony. The film attained a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards. Star Trek received several nominations. The film was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media, but was beaten out by Up, also composed by Michael Giacchino. At the 36th People's Choice Awards, the film received four nominations: the film was a contender for Favorite Movie, Zoe Saldana was nominated for Favorite Breakout Movie Actress, and both Pine and Quinto were nominated for Favorite Breakout Movie Actor. On June 15, 2009, the film was nominated for five Teen Choice Awards. In addition, Star Trek was nominated for five Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards and was named one of the top-ten films of 2009 by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures. The film's major cast members signed on for two sequels as part of their original deals. Abrams and Bryan Burk signed to produce and Abrams signed to direct the first sequel. The sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan Noonien Singh, was released on May 15, 2013. A third film, Star Trek Beyond, directed by Justin Lin and starring Idris Elba as the main antagonist, was released on July 22, 2016, to positive reviews. In July 2016, Abrams confirmed plans for a fourth film, and stated that Chris Hemsworth would return as Kirk's father. Most of the cast and producers of Beyond have also agreed to return; however, Abrams stated Anton Yelchin's role would not be recast following his death.",Normal
"American country music artist Crystal Gayle has released 15 music videos and 68 singles, including six as a collaborative artist, four as a featured artist, and six promos. Gayle's debut single was 1970's ""I've Cried (The Blue Right Out of My Eyes)"" via Decca Records, which reached number 23 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. Encouraged by her sister to develop her own musical style, Gayle signed with United Artists Records where she began recording country pop material. That year ""Wrong Road Again"" reached number 6 on the country chart, launching several major hits including ""I'll Do It All Over Again"" and her first #1 hit, ""I'll Get Over You"". She released ""Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue"" in 1977 which became her signature song and brought her crossover pop success. It topped the country chart, reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, and became an international hit. Its success elevated her career and was followed by three more number-one country singles: ""Ready for the Times to Get Better"", ""Why Have You Left the One You Left Me For"", and the top-twenty pop hit ""Talking in Your Sleep"". Transitioning to Columbia Records in 1979, ""Half the Way"" became Gayle's third top-20 pop hit and reached number 2 on the Billboard country chart. She continued to regularly top the country chart, with crossovers into the Hot 100 during the 1980s. Examples include 1980's ""It's Like We Never Said Goodbye"" and ""If You Ever Change Your Mind"". ""The Woman in Me"" (1981) reached number 3 on the country chart and number 76 on the Hot 100. From 1982 to 1984, she had four number-one country hits, including the crossover successes ""Baby, What About You"" and ""The Sound of Goodbye"". Featured on Eddie Rabbitt's ""You and I"" (1982), she garnered a 10th chart-topping country single and second top-10 on the Hot 100. The number-one hit ""Makin' Up for Lost Time"" (1985) started a two-year collaboration with Gary Morris. In 1986, a cover of ""Cry"" and the original ""Straight to the Heart"" became her final number-one hits, as toward the end of the decade, her success declined. Her 1990 cover of ""Never Ending Song of Love"" became her last appearance on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. Gayle has continued issuing singles and has been featured on other artists' releases. In 2010, she was featured on Mishavonna's holiday single ""Christmas Everywhere"".",Normal

"Lulu Atlantis and the Quest for True Blue Love is a 2008 novel by Patricia Martin. Lulu Atlantis lives in Sweet Pea Lane. She has a baby brother and a dad that is busy trying to save endangered animals. Lulu tells her troubles to her best friend, a spider named Harry. Harry is a talking spider that offers good advice. The spider says in order for her to find true blue love, she will have to go farther than her backyard. The four stories, that are linked together, makes her realize that she is loved. A Publishers Weekly review says, ""The scenarios are whimsical; the emotions run true."" A Kirkus Reviews review says, ""There's enough good old-fashioned curiosity and, quite frankly, weirdness in this early chapter book to overcome its potentially cutesy underpinnings. With descriptive sentences and a penchant for eclectic storytelling, this is an author to watch."" Charlotter Decker, of Library Media Connection, reviewed the book saying, ""This would be a good read-aloud. Let’s hope for more stories featuring Lulu.""

"Beverly K. ""Bev"" Hansen (born August 18, 1944 in Oroville, California) is an American politician from California and a member of the Republican Party. A former staffer to State Senator Jim Nielsen, Hansen was first elected to the California State Assembly in 1986 from the 8th District, representing Lake and Napa counties and parts of Sonoma and Yolo counties. A moderate, she won easily in 1988 and 1990, but opted not to seek reelection in 1992. This was mainly because her district had been redrawn after the 1991 reapportionment and had become decidedly more Democratic, making it a longshot for any Republican. She spent most of 1992 campaigning with and for fellow GOP Assemblyman Bill Filante, who had fallen ill during his run for congress. Had Filante won and been unable to serve, Hansen was mentioned as a possible candidate to replace him. This did not happen as Filante eventually lost to Democrat Lynn Woolsey and died shortly after the election. Hansen did, however, run for the California State Senate in a 1993 special election for the 4th district left vacant when Democratic incumbent Mike Thompson won election to the neighboring 2nd district (where his home wound up after reapportionment). She lost the GOP primary to then Shasta County Supervisor Maurice Johannessen by a wide margin. Hansen is a lobbyist for Lang, Hansen O'Malley, and Miller Governmental Relations.",Normal

"Chennamaneni Rajeshwara Rao (31 August 1923 - 9 May 2016) was an Indian communist leader and politician from the state of Telangana (former part of Andhra Pradesh). Between 1957 and 2004 he got elected six times to the State Legislative Assembly. Rajeshwara Rao was active in the Quit India Movement and the struggle against the Nizam's rule of Hyderabad. During the resistance he spent 5 years underground and in jail before entering electoral politics following the integration of Hyderabad state into the Indian Union. He was a long-time member of the Communist Party of India and in 1999 joined the Telugu Desam Party. He retired from active politics in 2009. Rajeshwara Rao was born to Chennamaneni Chandramma and Srinivasa Rao in the Marupaka village of Vemulawada Urban mandal, Karimnagar district, on 31 August 1923. He was the third child and had eight sisters and three brothers. According to his autobiography, he was interested in issues of social justice in Telangana from an early age on and often had the opportunity to observe the discussions of Andhra Mahasabha leaders, Polkampalli Venkatrama Rao and Baddam Yella Reddy, particularly when its fourth conference was held in Sircilla in 1935. Influenced by this movement he later came into contact with Marxist ideology. In 1942, he joined the Communist Party of India and in 1944 became regular member of the party. Rajeshwara Rao attended Karimnagar High School till 1943 and subsequently entered Osmania University to become a lawyer. Rajeshwara Rao was part of the Osmania University Students Union and the All Hyderabad Students Union. During his student years, Rajeshwara Rao worked as a student organizer and went on to become a leader of the Osmania University Students Union. He participated in the railway strike. He graduated in 1947, B.Sc. and left University as part of the Quit College Movement to actively participate in the ongoing Freedom struggle, he later completed his LL.B. in 1963. As a student Rajeshwara Rao joined the Telangana Armed Struggle against Nizam of Hyderabad and actively participated in Freedom Movement of India. He worked under veteran Telangana Armed Struggle leader Ravi Narayana Reddy. Due to his active participation in the Telangana Rebellion against the ruling Nizam of Hyderabad, Rajeshwara Rao lived underground from September 1947 till October 1951 when he was arrested under the Preventive Detention Act (PDA). In this period of underground and jail life, Rajeshwara Rao, his wife Lalitha, their two daughters Aruna and Kalpana, both born in this period, and his brother Ch. Hanumantha Rao faced severe hardships. Rajeshwara Rao worked closely with famous Urdu poet Makhdoom Mohiuddin when they all lived in underground dens in Sabzeemandi and chikkadpally, before being arrested. While underground, he organised different student actions, like hosting the Indian flag on Independence day, 15 August as well as the training of students for the armed struggle of Telangana. In 1948, he got elected General Secretary of the AHSU in a secret meeting and led a delegation to the South East Asian Youth Conference in Kolkata the same year. He also attended the second congress of the CPI in Calcutta in 1948. After he was released on parole in February 1952, Rajeshwara Rao advocated the implementation of the Tenancy and Land Reform legislation and was soon rearrested. Only after the ruling of the Indian Supreme Court declaring the PDA unconstitutional, Rajeshwara Rao was ultimately freed months later. He served as the Acting District Secretary of the CPI till 1956 and subsequently got elected D.C. Secretary. Rajeshwara Rao was active in movements like the Andhra Mahasabha, during the Telangana Armed Struggle, as a farmers organizer (Kisan), and later as a long time legislator. Highly influenced by leaders like Anabheri Prabhakara Rao and Singireddy Bhupathi Reddy in Karimnagar district, Rajeshwara Rao worked with tenants and landless against the feudal system of the Nizam. He supported the implementation of land and tenant reforms and the redistribution of government lands in the last decade of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s. Rajeshwara Rao highlights in his autobiography the close work with Baddam Yella Reddy, Amritlal Shukla, K.V.Damodhara Rao, Eleti Raji Reddy, Joginipalli Ananda Rao, Polasani Chokka Rao, Mukund Lal Mishra, Baddam Malla Reddy, Japa Laxma Reddy, Ch. Venkat Rama Rao, Desini Mallayya, Annaboina Mallayya, Poodari Yellaiah, L. Muttayya, S. Nambaiah, Thakur Raja Ram Singh, Shyam Sunder Singh and many others. Rajeshwara Rao could not contest the first general elections held in February 1952 because he was released from jail on the last date of nomination and could not reach Metpalli, where he was supposed to contest on behalf of People's Democratic Front - a proxy for the Communist Party of India which was still banned at this time. In 1957, Rajeshwara Rao was elected to the first Legislative Assembly of Andhra Pradesh from the Choppadandi constituency. Throughout his career as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), he served the Karimnagar district and got re-elected five times from Sircilla and once from Choppadandi in the following years. He worked as Chief Whip of the CPI in the state parliament between 1957 and 1962 and then returned to university to finish his law degree in 1963. In the following three years he practised law in the Karimnagar District Court before re-entering the Legislative Assembly in 1967 and working as the CPI floor leader till 1972. He also served as a member of the CPI central committee for several years. Rajeshwara Rao was President of the Freedom Fighters Steering Committee appointed by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, from 1996 to 1998 and was instrumental in achieving pensions for freedom fighters of the Telangana Rebellion. Despite being one of the founding stalwarts of the Communist Movement in Telangana, in 1999, he sent a shockwave in political circles by snapping decades old relations with CPI and joined Telugu Desam Party (TDP) led by Chandra Babu Naidu. Rajeshwara Rao lost the subsequent elections in 1999 but got elected as an TDP MLA in 2004. After serving the term he retired in 2009. After leaving the CPI, Rajeshwara Rao continued to work through an NGO, the Self Employed Welfare Society (SEWS) with a number of projects supported by the German government, the European Union and Andhra Pradesh government. He was also working for the Freedom Fighters’ Organization, of which he was president until his demise. Rajeshwara Rao along with Devender Goud and others was instrumental in the TDP to convince Chandrababu Naidu to adopt separate Telangana resolution in TDP Mahanadu in May 2008. However, due to Naidu's reluctance Devender Goud quit the TDP. After Rajeshwara Rao's retirement from active politics at the age of 87, his son Ch Ramesh was elected in 2009 to the assembly as a candidate of TDPTRS alliance. Rajeshwara Rao's 30-year legislative career started in 1957 when he was elected as an MLA and became Chief Whip of the Communist Party, while Puchalapalli Sundarayya was the leader and Ravi Narayana Reddy and Arutla Kamala Devi were Deputy Leaders. Due to Rajeshwara Rao, his main concern was to serve the poor population of Telangana throughout his career. Besides supporting extensive land reforms he implemented a rural development program in Sircilla to electrify 175 villages by establishing a Cooperative Electric Supply Society (CESS) in the course of 5 years. He initiated the Mula Vagu (Nimmapalli) irrigation Project for the benefit of dry land farmers. He promoted education, upgraded schools and opened new colleges and a polytechnic and degree college in Siricilla. The policies also brought a 50% power subsidy to all powerloom weavers of Siricilla region. He contributed to the report of the backward class commission. Rajeshwara Rao moved a motion of privilege in the AP assembly against C. Rajagopalachari, the then CM of Madras, for his un-parliamentary remarks about communists. This notice was admitted by the speaker of the house and a notice was issued to the CM of Madras, upon which the CM regretted his remarks. Rajeshwara Rao has very openly expressed his serious concern about the quality and calibre of the people's representatives when compared to earlier decades. He argued that people with ability and capacity stay away from politics, while people with vested interests are very much interested to acquire political power. Moreover, he thinks that the membership of a party must be based on the actual contribution of the person to the service of the people. Besides the criticism Rajeshwara Rao faced when he objected to his own party's line, he also spurred controversy for leaving the CPI and for his remarks that the founder of the TDP, N.T. Rama Rao should be hanged for ignoring the development of Andhra Pradesh. In May 1944, Rajeshwara Rao married Smt. Lalita Devi, they have four children, Aruna, Kalpana, Prabha and Ramesh.The Chennamaneni family represents a unique combination of different political ideologies. Rajeshwara Rao was a staunch communist, freedom fighter and a proven parliamentarian, while one of his brothers, the renowned economist Ch. Hanumantha Rao, is a nehruvian socialist and served as a member of the National Planning Commission under Rajiv Gandhi led Congress Government. Whereas another brother Ch. Venkateshwar Rao is a social worker. His youngest brother is Ch. Vidyasagar Rao, member of the BJP and presently the governor of Maharashtra. Rajeshwara Rao's son, Ramesh serves as a MLA from Vemulawada, and his nephew (sister's son), B. Vinod Kumar is a Member of Parliament; both of them belong to the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS).",Normal

"Pečine (pronounced ) is a village in the mountains above the right bank of the Idrijca River in the Municipality of Tolmin in the Littoral region of Slovenia. It includes the hamlets of Črni Vrh, Kabiunk, Kal, Maraževec, Podkal, Travnik, and Stari Rut. The name Pečine is a plural form derived from the word peč 'large cliff, rocky wall' (which developed from the earlier meaning 'hollow in a cliff', ultimately from 'place for cooking'). Like similar names (e.g., Peč, Pečice, Pečke, etc.), it refers to a local landscape element. In the hamlet of Stari Rut, 1 km northwest of Pečine, are the remains of an ancient hill fort. This site is still referred to as Castle Peak (Slovene: Vrh gradu) locally. A silver Roman fibula found in the area, now kept at the museum in Tolmin, attests to early settlement here. During the Second World War, the village was bombarded by German forces in February 1944, destroying several houses. A battle took place between German forces and Yugoslav Partisan units in the hamlet of Travnik on 19 March 1945, and another engagement at the hill to the west known as Lorčevo brdo in April 1945. The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saints Hermagoras and Fortunatus and belongs to the Diocese of Koper. The church and its portico were renovated in 1896, and in 1932 it was decorated with paintings by Cene Lapanja (1886–1966) from the neighboring village of Ponikve.

"Pest risk analysis (PRA) is a form of risk analysis conducted by regulatory plant health authorities to identify the appropriate phytosanitary measures required to protect plant resources against new or emerging pests and regulated pests of plants or plant products. Specifically pest risk analysis is a term used within the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) (Article 2.1) and is defined within the glossary of phytosanitary terms. as ""the process of evaluating biological or other scientific and economic evidence to determine whether an organism is a pest, whether it should be regulated, and the strength of any phytosanitary measures to be taken against it"". In a phytosanitary context, the term plant pest, or simply pest, refers to any species, strain or biotype of plant, animal or pathogenic agent injurious to plants or plant products and includes plant pathogenic bacteria, fungi, fungus-like organisms, viruses and virus like organisms, as well as insects, mites, nematodes and weeds. Introduced plant pests can lower crop yields and have environmental impacts. The spread of plant pests from one geographical area to another is an issue of international concern. The principal international agreement aimed at addressing the spread of plant pests through international trade is the International Plant Protection Convention, a multilateral treaty for international cooperation in plant protection aimed at preventing the spread of pests of plants and plant products, and promoting appropriate measures for their control (IPPC, Article I.1). In accordance with the WTO Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement the IPPC aims to protect plants while limiting interference with international trade. A key principle of the IPPC is that contracting parties (signatories) provide ‘technical justification’ to support phytosanitary decision making affecting trade. The IPPC recognises pest risk analysis as the appropriate format for such technical justification. The responsibility for conducting pest risk analysis sits within government, specifically within a country's National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO) and comes as an obligation when countries become contracting parties to the IPPC (IPPC Article IV, 2a). IPPC standards, referred to as International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM), have been developed to assist NPPOs. The primary ISPMs relevant to pest risk analysis are ISPM 2, Framework for pest risk analysis, ISPM 11, Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests and ISPM 21, Pest risk analysis for regulated non-quarantine pests. Although ISPMs relating to pest risk analysis provide guidance regarding the factors to consider when conducting analyses, they do not provide instructions as to how to actually perform a pest risk analysis. However, many countries including Australia, New Zealand and the USA, have developed procedures to assess the pest risks associated with the import of plant commodities. Devorshak (2012) describes the principles of pest risk analysis, how analyses can be performed and the use of pest risk analysis in regulatory plant protection. A general guide to the principles of pest risk analysis for plant pests and a description of some of the problems and difficulties that may be encountered when undertaking such analyses are included in text by Ebbels (2003) which also covers wider plant health issues. In accordance with ISPM 11, a pest risk analysis consists of three stages. Common reasons for initiating a pest risk analysis include: Within the initiation stage of a pest risk analysis the reason for conducting the analysis, the identity of the pest and or pathways being analysed and the area in relation to which the analysis is conducted (the pest risk analysis area) is provided. There are three steps to the assessment of pest risk. The purpose of pest categorization is to determine whether a pest identified during the initiation stage satisfies the criteria of being a quarantine pest. A quarantine pest is a pest of potential economic importance to the area endangered thereby and not yet present there, or present but not widely distributed and being officially controlled. Pest categorization includes all the main elements considered in Step 2 of a pest risk assessment but the elements are considered in less detail and pest categorization is essentially a quick assessment of whether the analysis should continue. The categorization step provides an opportunity to eliminate a pest from analysis at an early stage in the pest risk analysis process thus avoiding unnecessary in-depth examination. Pest categorization can be done with relatively little information, provided that the information available is sufficient to carry out the categorization. Assessing the likelihood of pest entry requires assessment of each of the pathways with which a pest may be associated, from its origin to its establishment in the pest risk analysis area. In a pest risk analysis initiated by a specific pathway, often an imported commodity or goods associated with an imported commodity, e.g. packing materials, the probability of pest entry is evaluated for that specific pathway. For a pest risk analysis initiated for a specific pest, all probable pathways are evaluated for that individual pest. To estimate the likelihood of establishment of a pest, biological information about the pest including its life cycle, its hosts or habitat needs, or a diseases epidemiology, together with characteristics of the abiotic environment affecting pest survival such as temperature, precipitation and perhaps soil type affecting its geographic range limit need to be considered. The environmental conditions under which the pest does not survive are also important to understand. Conditions in the pest risk analysis area can then be compared with conditions in areas where the pest survives, and in areas where the pest is known not to be able to survive, so as to assess the likelihood that the pest will establish in the pest risk analysis area. Computer simulation models can be used to inform assessments of likelihood of establishment. When assessing the likelihood and magnitude of pest spread, the pest's ability to disperse from a point of introduction to new areas within the pest risk analysis area is assessed. The assessment should consider pest population dynamics and the natural mobility of the pest and take into account potential spread via wind, water, soil, seed and pollen, and insect, fungal or nematode vectors as well as spread via human activities such as movement of host material. In this step the potential impacts that could be expected to result from a pest's introduction and spread is identified, described and, as much as possible, quantified. Pest impacts can take many forms; they may be economic environmental or social impacts. Information on the species impacts in areas where it is already present, and particularly in areas where it has already spread to, together with information influencing the elements of risk in the pest risk analysis area, inform the assessment of potential consequences. Impacts reported from invaded areas are recognized as the best indicator of potential impacts in the pest risk analysis area . However, regarding environmental impacts, if the pest has not previously spread then the absence of any environmental impact in the area of pest origin should not be interpreted to mean that no environmental impact should be expected in the pest risk analysis area. This is because environmental impacts are difficult to predict and a lack of impact in the origin is not a good predictor that there will be no impacts in regions where a pest is introduced. Recognising that risk is a combination of likelihood and consequences, the results of steps 2 and 3 are combined to provide an overall estimation of pest risk. For a quarantine pest, pest risk management is the process of evaluation and selection of options to reduce the risk of introduction and spread of the pest. Conclusions from the pest risk assessment (Stage 2) are used to support decisions regarding the level of risk presented by the pest. If a pest is judged to present an unacceptable risk then phytosanitary measures should be identified that will reduce the risk to an acceptable level. Phytosanitary measures should accord with IPPC principles of necessity, managed risk, minimal impact, transparency, harmonization, non-discrimination and technical justification. ISPM 11 provides more information about each stage of pest risk analysis for quarantine pests. The level of detail in a pest risk analysis will be limited by the amount and quality of information available, the tools, and time available before a decision is required. Quantitative and qualitative techniques are used in pest risk analysis but pest risk analysis need only be as complex as is required by the circumstances to support a phytosanitary decision and provide the necessary technical justification to defend decisions regarding phytosanitary measures. Nevertheless, a pest risk analysis should be based on sound science, be transparent and consistent with other pest risk analyses conducted by the NPPO. Examples of pest risk analysis are available in the EPPO Platform on PRA. Estimating the likelihood of pest introduction and of the consequences that could result involves many uncertainties. Uncertainty is always part of pest risk analysis; very often there is a lack of data necessary to reach secure conclusions. The subjective nature of pest risk analysis is also a source of uncertainty. ISPM 11 recognises that pest risk analysis involves many uncertainties, largely since estimates and extrapolations are made from real situations where the pest occurs to a hypothetical situation in the pest risk analysis area. In most cases analyses performed during pest risk analysis use historical data to forecast potential future events. It is important to document the areas of uncertainty and the degree of uncertainty in the assessment, and to indicate where expert judgement has been used. This is necessary for transparency and may also be useful for identifying and prioritizing research needs. Pest risk analysis, as conducted under the IPPC and SPS Agreement, has been criticised for being reactive, only coming into effect after a pest problem has been identified. For example, many pests now subject to phytosanitary measures, supported by pest risk analysis, only became recognised as potential risks once they had already escaped from their geographical centres of origin and caused impacts in other parts of the world. Some ‘newly escaped’ organisms were previously unknown to science before they escaped and current international standards for pest risk analysis cannot assess risks from unknown organisms. In addition, a pest risk analysis will focus on a pest at the species level assuming the pest to be genetically stable but this can be a great oversimplification if the pest has a short generation time with capacity for rapid genetic change. During the assessment of impact, assessors focus on impacts on known hosts or habitats. However, if a pest adapts to a new host plant or habitat once established in the pest risk analysis area, impacts will be underestimated. Risk analyses for invasive species have also been criticised for being narrowly focused, subjective, often arbitrary and unquantified, and subject to political interference.",Normal

"Ghostly Haunts was an American horror-suspense anthology comic book series published by Charlton Comics from 1971 to 1978. The book was ""hosted"" by Winnie the Witch, a ""moddish"" blue-skinned witch. Ghostly Haunts was part of a wave of new horror and suspense comics published by Charlton during this period. Its sister titles, with many of the same creators, were the Charlton anthologies The Many Ghosts of Doctor Graves (with host Dr. M. T. Graves), Ghostly Tales (with host Mr. L. Dedd, later I. M. Dedd), Ghost Manor (with host Mr. Bones), Haunted (with hosts Impy and then Baron Weirwulf), and Scary Tales (with host Countess R. H. Von Bludd). Although Charlton's low page-rates and slapdash production values typically resulted in few notable characters or stories; Ghostly Haunts featured some memorable stories in the old EC Comics vein, especially in its later issues (one theory for this being that the Charlton line was so obscure that it often evaded the eye of the Comics Code Authority censors). Ghostly Haunts debuted with issue #20, taking over the numbering of Ghost Manor volume one. Ghostly Haunts was published bimonthly; it went on a publishing hiatus between issues #53 and #54, which lasted from January to August 1977. Charlton's horror titles all went on hiatus during this period; Ghostly Haunts was cancelled shortly thereafter, with its April 1978 issue, #58, being the final one published. Altogether, Ghostly Haunts published 39 issues. Regular contributors to Ghostly Haunts included Jack Abel, Vince Alascia, Pat Boyette, Nicola Cuti, Steve Ditko, Joe Gill, Fred Himes, Wayne Howard, Sanho Kim, Rich Larson, Pete Morisi, Steve Morisi, Don Newton, Charles Nicholas, Don Perlin, Warren Sattler, Joe Staton, and Tom Sutton. Ghostly Haunts was primarily edited by George Wildman, who took over the title from Sal Gentile with issue #26 (August 1972), and helmed the book for the rest of its run.",Normal

"Chavakachcheri Urban Council (Tamil: சாவகச்சேரி நகர சபை Cāvakaccēri Nakara Capai; CUC) is the local authority for the town of Chavakachcheri in northern Sri Lanka. CUC is responsible for providing a variety of local public services including roads, sanitation, drains, housing, libraries, public parks and recreational facilities. It has 11 members elected using the open list proportional representation system. Results of the local government election held on 18 May 1983: According to the pro-LTTE TamilNet, the Sri Lankan government had suspended all local government in the north and east of the country in 1983 using emergency regulations. The civil war prevented elections from being held for CUC until 1998 as the LTTE did not hold elections when it controlled the area. In March 1994 elections were held in the east and in Vavuniya in the north. However, elections weren't held in other areas of the north, including the Jaffna peninsula, because most of these areas were at that time controlled by the rebel Tamil Tigers. In August 1995 the Sri Lankan military launched an offensive to recapture the Jaffna peninsula. By December 1995 the military had captured most of the Valikamam region of the peninsula, including the city of Jaffna. By 16 May 1996 the military had recaptured the entire peninsula. In late 1996 the government announced elections would be held for 23 local authorities in Jaffna District, Kilinochchi District, Mannar District and Vavuniya District but following opposition from Tamil political parties postponed them. On 3 December 1997 the government announced that elections would be held for the 17 local authorities on the Jaffna peninsula. The Tamil political parties were still opposed to holding elections as ""normalcy"" hadn't returned to the peninsula. The peninsula was under the firm grip of the Sri Lankan military and civil government had little, if any, role in the administration of the peninsula. The Tamil Tigers were also firmly against the elections being held. Despite these objections the elections were held on 29 January 1998. Results of the local government election held on 29 January 1998: On 1 January 2002 local authority elections were called for the entire country. It was later announced that elections would be held on 25 March 2002 in the north and east, and on 20 March 2002 in the rest of the country. The normal life term of Sri Lankan local government bodies is four years. The life term of CUC expired in February 2002 but the central government extended this by another year, as the law allows. On 21 March 2002 the Election Commissioner announced that the elections in the north and east, except for eight local authorities in Ampara District, had been postponed until 25 September 2002. On 17 September 2002 elections in the north and east were postponed, for a second time, until 25 June 2003. Elections should have been held when the extension expired in February 2003 but in January 2003, following a request from the Tamil National Alliance, the central government instead dissolved CUC using emergency powers and instead put in place special commissioners to administer the local area. In June 2003 elections in the north and east were postponed, for a third time, until 24 January 2004. In January 2004 elections in the north and east, except for local authorities in Ampara District, were postponed, for a fourth time, until 23 October 2004. On 27 January 2006 local authority elections were called for the entire country. It was later announced that elections would be held on 30 March 2006 across the entire country. The Election Commissioner subsequently postponed the elections in the north and Batticaloa District until 30 September 2006. On 23 September 2006 elections in the north and Batticaloa District were postponed until 30 June 2007. CUC continued to be administered by special commissioners until the 2011 elections. Results of the local government election held on 23 July 2011: The following candidates were elected: Rapiyel Thevasagayampillai (TNA), 1,807 preference votes (pv); Kumarasamy Sathasivamoorthy (TNA), 1,311 pv; Kandiah Mylvaganam (TNA), 1,104 pv; Arunachalam Balamayuran (TNA), 1,103 pv; Kasilingam Satkunadevan (TNA), 964 pv; Ponnuthurai Selvaratnam (TNA), 763 pv; Gnanapirakasam Kishor (TNA), 749 pv; Paramasami Sritharan (TNA), 690 pv; Soosaimuthu Alexander (UPFA), 540 pv; Thanapalasingam Sutharshan (TNA), 454 pv; and Nadarasa Thirukumaran (UPFA), 425 pv.

"In computer science, a mutator method is a method used to control changes to a variable. They are also widely known as setter methods. Often a setter is accompanied by a getter, which returns the value of the private member variable. They are also known collectively as accessors. The mutator method is most often used in object-oriented programming, in keeping with the principle of encapsulation. According to this principle, member variables of a class are made private to hide and protect them from other code, and can only be modified by a public member function (the mutator method), which takes the desired new value as a parameter, optionally validates it, and modifies the private member variable. Mutator methods can be compared to assignment operator overloading but they typically appear at different levels of the object hierarchy. Mutator methods may also be used in non-object-oriented environments. In this case, a reference to the variable to be modified is passed to the mutator, along with the new value. In this scenario, the compiler cannot restrict code from bypassing the mutator method and changing the variable directly. The responsibility falls to the developers to ensure the variable is only modified through the mutator method and not modified directly. In programming languages that support them, properties offer a convenient alternative without giving up the utility of encapsulation. In the examples below, a fully implemented mutator method can also validate the input data or take further action such as triggering an event. The alternative to defining mutator and accessor methods, or property blocks, is to give the instance variable some visibility other than private and access it directly from outside the objects. Much finer control of access rights can be defined using mutators and accessors. For example, a parameter may be made read-only simply by defining an accessor but not a mutator. The visibility of the two methods may be different; it is often useful for the accessor to be public while the mutator remains protected, package-private or internal. The block where the mutator is defined provides an opportunity for validation or preprocessing of incoming data. If all external access is guaranteed to come through the mutator, then these steps cannot be bypassed. For example, if a date is represented by separate private year, month and day variables, then incoming dates can be split by the setDate mutator while for consistency the same private instance variables are accessed by setYear and setMonth. In all cases month values outside of 1 - 12 can be rejected by the same code. Accessors conversely allow for synthesis of useful data representations from internal variables while keeping their structure encapsulated and hidden from outside modules. A monetary getAmount accessor may build a string from a numeric variable with the number of decimal places defined by a hidden currency parameter. Modern programming languages often offer the ability to generate the boilerplate for mutators and accessors in a single line—as for example C#'s public string Name { get; set; } and Ruby's attr_accessor :name. In these cases, no code blocks are created for validation, preprocessing or synthesis. These simplified accessors still retain the advantage of encapsulation over simple public instance variables, but it is common that, as system designs progress, the software is maintained and requirements change, the demands on the data become more sophisticated. Many automatic mutators and accessors eventually get replaced by separate blocks of code. The benefit of automatically creating them in the early days of the implementation is that the public interface of the class remains identical whether or not greater sophistication is added, requiring no extensive refactoring if it is. Manipulation of parameters that have mutators and accessors from inside the class where they are defined often requires some additional thought. In the early days of an implementation, when there is little or no additional code in these blocks, it makes no difference if the private instance variable is accessed directly or not. As validation, cross-validation, data integrity checks, preprocessing or other sophistication is added, subtle bugs may appear where some internal access makes use of the newer code while in other places it is bypassed. Accessor functions can be less efficient than directly fetching or storing data fields due to the extra steps involved, however such functions are often inlined which eliminates the overhead of a function call. In file student.h: In file student.c: In file main.c: In file Makefile: In file Student.h: In file Student.cpp: This example illustrates the C# idea of properties, which are a special type of class member. Unlike Java, no explicit methods are defined; a public 'property' contains the logic to handle the actions. Note use of the built-in (undeclared) variable value. In later C# versions (.NET Framework 3.5 and above), this example may be abbreviated as follows, without declaring the private variable name. Using the abbreviated syntax means that the underlying variable is no longer available from inside the class. As a result, the set portion of the property must be present for assignment. Access can be restricted with a set-specific access modifier. In Common Lisp Object System, slot specifications within class definitions may specify any of the :reader, :writer and :accessor options (even multiple times) to define reader methods, setter methods and accessor methods (a reader method and the respective setf method). Slots are always directly accessible through their names with the use of with-slots and slot-value, and the slot accessor options define specialized methods that use slot-value. CLOS itself has no notion of properties, although the MetaObject Protocol extension specifies means to access a slot's reader and writer function names, including the ones generated with the :accessor option. The following example shows a definition of a student class using these slot options and direct slot access: D supports a getter and setter function syntax. In version 2 of the language getter and setter classstruct methods should have the @property attribute. A Student instance can be used like this: This is a simple class in Delphi language which illustrates the concept of public property for accessing a private field. In this example of a simple class representing a student with only the name stored, one can see the variable name is private, i.e. only visible from the Student class, and the ""setter"" and ""getter"" are public, namely the ""getName()"" and ""setName(name)"" methods. In this example constructor-function Student is used to create objects representing a student with only the name stored. Or (using a deprecated way to define accessors in Web browsers): Or (using prototypes for inheritance and ES6 accessor syntax): Or (without using prototypes): Or (using defineProperty): Using traditional Objective-C 1.0 syntax, with manual reference counting as the one working on GNUstep on Ubuntu 12.04: Using newer Objective-C 2.0 syntax as used in Mac OS X 10.6, iOS 4 and Xcode 3.2, generating the same code as described above: And starting with OS X 10.8 and iOS 6, while using Xcode 4.4 and up, syntax can be even simplified: Or, using Class::Accessor Or, using the Moose Object System: PHP defines the ""magic methods"" __getand__set for properties of objects. In this example of a simple class representing a student with only the name stored, one can see the variable name is private, i.e. only visible from the Student class, and the ""setter"" and ""getter"" is public, namely the getName() and setName('name') methods. This example uses a Python class with one variable, a getter, and a setter. In Racket, the object system is a way to organize code that comes in addition to modules and units. As in the rest of the language, the object system has first-class values and lexical scope is used to control access to objects and methods. Struct definitions are an alternative way to define new types of values, with mutators being present when explicitly required: In Ruby, individual accessor and mutator methods may be defined, or the metaprogramming constructs attr_reader or attr_accessor may be used both to declare a private variable in a class and to provide either read-only or read-write public access to it respectively. Defining individual accessor and mutator methods creates space for pre-processing or validation of the data Read-only simple public access to implied @name variable Read-write simple public access to implied @name variable This example illustrates the VB.NET idea of properties, which are used in classes. Similar to C#, there is an explicit use of the Get and Set methods. In VB.NET 2010, Auto Implemented properties can be utilized to create a property without having to use the Get and Set syntax. Note that a hidden variable is created by the compiler, called _name, to correspond with the Property name. Using another variable within the class named _name would result in an error. Privileged access to the underlying variable is available from within the class.",Normal

"Florinda is an ABS-CBN weekly television series format adapted from the movie of the same title originally starred by Susan Roces in 1973. which was aired from September 7 to October 2, 2009, replacing The Wedding and was replaced by Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up. This is the third and final installment of Sineserye Presents: The Susan Roces Cinema Collection. This series is currently streaming on Jeepney TV YouTube Channel every 7:00 pm, replacing Lorenzo's Time. Florinda is a 1973 suspense thriller. It was serialized in Tagalog Klasiks and was written by Rico Bello-Omagap and the movie was directed by Armando Herrera. The film starred Susan Roces in the title role, Florinda. The ensemble cast also includes Dante Rivero, Rosemarie Gil, Ramil Rodriguez, and the late Jay Ilagan. The Film revolves on an avenging love between the titular character, Florinda and the man she truly loves - Rodrigo (in the remake renamed as Ramil) but one day before their wedding, an unlikely disappearance begins with Rodrigo which causes Florinda to panic but one night she will finally find out all the dark secrets locked within their new home. Strange things start to happen and she is being haunted by strange and disturbing dreams, including a ghostly corpse of a man. She soon realizes that there is something evil lurking beneath the old house. Florinda is a final installment of The Susan Roces Cinema Collection in which genres Susan Roces' classic blockbuster suspense films turned into a four-week primetime series of the Queen of Philippine Movies. Ramil requests Florinda to help him restore his ancestral home. On their site visit, Florinda relives painful memories she once had there. It seems Ramil's mother, Doña Cristina, greatly disapproves of her relationship with the lad, so the old lady persistently sets them apart up until her final breath. Despite his mother’s refusal, Ramil decides to ask Florinda's hand in marriage. Surprisingly, even from her grave, Doña Cristina openly expresses her displeasure. On the day of the wedding, Ramil fails to show up; immediately, Florinda goes in search. With no idea where her groom could have gone, Florinda breaks down. Mother and daughter, Criselda and Mara, finally reach Florinda's new-found home after accepting Ramil's job offer a few days back. Florinda instantly recognizes the Criselda from the past, since the said lady used to serve Ramil's family. On the other hand, upon learning about her sister Florinda's paranormal experiences, Rachelle consults an expert. To her surprise, the professional confirms that there is, in fact, a vengeful spirit residing in their new home. Rachelle’s friends Gladys and Archie only played a trick on her: The paranormal experience they have encountered is merely an act the two staged. On the other hand, Florinda somehow feels Doña Cristina persistently haunting her, but she puts the thought aside. Despite the rather unusual experiences, she continues to go in search for her missing groom, thus making other people think that she is gradually losing her mind. Aware of her sister’s current state, Rachelle then tries to convince Florinda to undergo psychological treatment. Instead of being thankful for her sister’s support, Florinda furiously exclaims that she is not ill. Florinda finally grows convinced that there is a bothered spirit residing in her house after Caloy confirmed her story. Immediately, she consults her housemaid Criselda regarding the matter. Aside from Criselda, Florinda also informs Eric; she relays to the policeman all the information she had gathered from Caloy, including the fact that the kid saw Ramil enter the house. Rachelle is starting to grow impatient of her sister who keeps on insisting about Donya Cristina's bothered soul roaming around. It is shown at a part on the series that Criselda loved Ramil and wanted marry him. So for her, killing Florinda is the only way to marry Ramil. A killing begins to her wrath of murdering Florinda, killing Florinda and Rachelle's trusted people. When Ramil escapes from Criselda, she finds the chance to stab Florinda. But when Criselda nearly stabs Florinda, the ghost of Doña Cristina appeared to her. In the end, Criselda goes to a mental prison, while Mara is imprisoned for being an accomplice when she helped Florinda, Rachelle and Ramil escape. Florinda is in a hospital due to the stab to her leg and refuses Ramil's offer of marriage. She makes Rachelle the caretaker of the house. When Florinda finally went out of hospital, she prays at a church and finds Caloy. To her surprise, she finally knew that Caloy was a ghost and they lived happily ever after.",Normal
"The 1987 Busch 500 was the 20th stock car race of the 1987 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season and the 27th iteration of the event. The race was held on Saturday, August 22, 1987, before an audience of 48,477 in Bristol, Tennessee, at Bristol International Speedway, a 0.533 miles (0.858km) permanent oval-shaped racetrack. The race took the scheduled 500 laps to complete. At race's end, Richard Childress Racing's Dale Earnhardt managed to dominate a majority of the race, leading 415 laps to take his 29th career NASCAR Winston Cup Series victory and his ninth victory of the season. With the victory, Earnhardt was able to increase his driver's championship lead over Bill Elliott to 545 points. To fill out the top three, Blue Max Racing's Rusty Wallace and Bud Moore Engineering's Ricky Rudd finished second and third, respectively. The Bristol Motor Speedway, formerly known as Bristol International Raceway and Bristol Raceway, is a NASCAR short track venue located in Bristol, Tennessee. Constructed in 1960, it held its first NASCAR race on July 30, 1961. Despite its short length, Bristol is among the most popular tracks on the NASCAR schedule because of its distinct features, which include extraordinarily steep banking, an all concrete surface, two pit roads, and stadium-like seating. It has also been named one of the loudest NASCAR tracks. Qualifying was split into two rounds. The first round was held on Friday, August 21, at 7:35 PM EST. Each driver had one lap to set a time. During the first round, the top 15 drivers in the round were guaranteed a starting spot in the race. If a driver was not able to guarantee a spot in the first round, they had the option to scrub their time from the first round and try and run a faster lap time in a second round qualifying run, held on Saturday, August 22, at 1:00 PM EST. As with the first round, each driver had one lap to set a time. For this specific race, positions 16-30 were decided on time, and depending on who needed it, a select amount of positions were given to cars who had not otherwise qualified but were high enough in owner's points; up to two provisionals were given. Terry Labonte, driving for Junior Johnson & Associates, managed to win the pole, setting a time of 16.576 and an average speed of 115.758 miles per hour (186.294kmh) in the first round.

"PTV Vissim is a microscopic multi-modal traffic flow simulation software package developed by PTV Planung Transport Verkehr AG in Karlsruhe, Germany. The name is derived from ""Verkehr In Städten - SIMulationsmodell"" (German for ""Traffic in cities - simulation model""). PTV Vissim was first developed in 1992 and is today a global market leader. The scope of application ranges from various issues of traffic engineering (transport engineering, transportation planning, signal timing), public transport, urban planning over fire protection (evacuation simulation) to 3d visualization (computer animation, architectural animation) for illustrative purpose and communication to the general public. PTV Vissim is part of the PTV Vision Traffic Suite which also includes PTV Visum (traffic analysis and forecasting) and PTV Vistro (signal optimisation and traffic impact). The basic traffic model ruling the movement of vehicles was developed by Rainer Wiedemann in 1974 at Karlsruhe University. It is a car-following model that considers physical and psychological aspects of the drivers. The model underlying pedestrian dynamics is the Social Force Model by Dirk Helbing et al. from 1995. ""Microscopic simulation"", sometimes called microsimulation, means each entity (car, train, person) of reality is simulated individually, i.e. it is represented by a corresponding entity in the simulation, thereby considering all relevant properties. The same holds for the interactions between the entities. The opposite would be a ""macroscopic simulation"", in which the description of reality is shifted from individuals to ""averaged"" variables like flow and density. The corresponding product from the same manufacturer is called Visum. In Vissim the following types of traffic can be simulated, and mutually interact: In VISSIM, all vehicles run along links, which represent traffic moving in one direction only along a road. Links are joined together with Connectors. Vehicle conflict points such as yielding or merging at junctions must be modelled explicitly using Priority Rules, Conflict Areas or Signal Heads. Signals can be modelled with fixed-time plans, or various modules such as VAP (Vehicle Actuated Programming) are available to model on-demand signals and other types of control and coordination.

"Iola is a city in Grimes County, Texas, United States, on Farm to Market Road 39 and the Burlington-Rock Island Railroad, at the headwaters of Ragan Creek in northwestern Grimes County. As of the 2010 census the population was 401. On November 6, 2007, it became the fifth incorporated city in Grimes County after a residential vote. Iola is believed to have been named for Edward Ariola, one of Stephen F. Austin's colonists who settled in the vicinity in 1836. In 1852 the community's first church, Zion Methodist, was constructed; the building also served as a schoolhouse. The settlement's first gristmill, Monroe's Gin, began operating during the 1860s. The post office opened in 1871 and, though discontinued the next year, was permanently reestablished in 1877. A Masonic Lodge was formed in 1876. By the 1880s the town had several churches, cotton gins, and gristmills. The population stood at 109 by 1890. Between 1906 and 1907 both the Trinity and Brazos Valley Railway and the Houston and Texas Central Railway extended lines through Iola, and a new townsite was laid out along the tracks near the T&BV depot. A tap line of the Texas and New Orleans Railroad connected Iola with Navasota. The coming of the railroad invigorated the community. A print shop was established, and a newspaper appeared, the Iola Enterprise, edited and published by Rev. A. J. Frick, pastor of Zion Methodist Church. In 1909 the Iola State Bank was organized. The population reached 300 in 1910, and by 1936 the town had an estimated 500 people and twelve businesses. After World War II the population declined somewhat to an estimated 300 in 1950. Since then it has remained virtually level. During the 1970s and 1980s several nearby oilfields opened. In 1990 Iola had a population estimated at 331 and twelve businesses. In 2000 the population remained the same, but there were 39 businesses. Iola is located in northwestern Grimes County between Bryan, 23 miles (37km) to the southwest, and Huntsville, 36 miles (58km) to the east. Navasota, the largest city in Grimes County, is 32 miles (51km) to the south.

It also runs the largest non-commercial queer space in the MENA region through its community center and prioritizes decriminalization, labor rights, housing, hate speech, and economic empowerment as advocacy priorities. Its current executive director is Tarek Zeidan. Prior to Helem’s inception in 2001, a group of gay and lesbian activists created “Gay Lebanon”, a chat page on YAHOO! Chats to set up social and personal meetings. Members of the chat group interested in more political action and mobilization created the underground group called Club Free whose main purpose was to create spaces for dialogue and debate on queer rights and challenges facing the community. Following many incidents of discrimination and violence against LGBTQ individuals in Lebanon and in other countries in the MENA region— including the infamous Egyptian Queen Boat raid in 2001 (also known as the case of the Cairo 52)—Club Free members decided to mobilize further and founded the very first organization in the Arab region dedicated to the rights of the LGBTQ community, calling it “Helem”. In 2003, Helem activists staged a public boycott targeting the Beirut branches of Dunkin’ Donuts, stating that the international coffee chain had refused to serve “gay and gay-looking customers” and ask them to leave the premises. The boycott was significant as it was the first recorded incident of its kind to target a private institution in the MENA region and hold it accountable for homophobic and transphobic discrimination. The boycott received wide media attention in Lebanon. Another milestone for the group was in February 2003, when Helem activists took part in the global protest against the American invasion of Iraq, raising the pride flag as part of the 10,000-person-strong protest in Beirut. The protest marked the first time on record that a rainbow flag was raised on Arab soil. On September 24, 2004, Helem formally applied for registration as a non-governmental organization at the Lebanese Ministry of Interior and established its first public community center in the Hamra area of Beirut on Spears Street. The organization offered an emergency hotline for LGBTQ individuals in crisis, a queer-identified community space, and the first outreach and education programs promoting safe sex and information about HIV. The public announcement of Helem’s space prompted a backlash from political and religious figures in Lebanon, with one of Beirut municipality’s council members openly calling on the government to release an injunction to thwart Helem’s work, as it was alleged to be promoting perversion. Conservative Muslim clerics also accused the government of approving and authorizing “a gay rights group,"" claims that were then echoed by Lebanon’s previous Interior Minister Ahmed Fatfat. As a result, Helem was illegally denied its formal registration papers by the Ministry of Interior, sparking a decades long legal fight for registration that continues as of July, 2021. While other subsequent gay rights groups were able to register as general “human rights” organizations, Helem has chosen to maintain its insistence on registering as a fully recognized LGBTQ-rights organization. In 2004, members of the Lebanese queer diaspora established satellite organizations for Helem in Paris, France and Montreal, Canada. The Montreal group continues its work to this day as a locus for community support for all queers of Lebanese or MENA descent residing in Canada. In 2005, Helem organized its first event in honor of the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia under the slogan “I Exist!”, sending a clear message to the Lebanese society of the group’s intention to be visible, active, and political. It also published the first public LGBT magazine in the Arab region, “Barra” (Arabic for “Out”), which provided space for LGBTQ writers to challenge dominant media narratives on gender and sexuality. Another prominent Helem publication of this era was ""Homophobia: Views and Positions"" (Arabic: رهاب المثلية: مواقف وشهادات) in 2006. This was one of Helem’s first publications that tackled the subject of homophobia. With a preface written by renowned queer Lebanese author Rabih Alameddine, the book dove into scientific and political cases against homophobia and denounced their prevalence in Lebanese and Arab society. In 2009, Helem organized its first public action, together with other human rights organizations, to oppose the governmental violence and oppression targeting minorities in Lebanon. The protest was in response to several incidents of violence by Lebanese citizens and police officers against gay men in Achrafieh, a neighborhood of Beirut. The protest was significant because it was the first public protest for LGBTQ rights in the region where demonstrators were visible and open about their identities and demands in front of the media and public. In 2012, Helem organized another landmark protest and launched the “Abolish the Examinations of Shame” campaign, following the events of the Cinema Plaza crackdown (during which 36 men were arrested at a local cinema and subsequently coerced by police officers into undergoing anal probe tests to determine their sexual orientation). Helem held this protest in front of the Lebanese Ministry of Justice in Beirut, drawing larger crowds, under the slogan ""Get Off Our Ass"" (Arabic: “حلو عن طيزنا”) demanding immediate halt to the use of the anal examinations as part of investigations aimed to determining a person’s sexual orientation. Helem was successful in halting rectal examinations by mobilizing and coordinating with the Lebanese Psychological Association, the Lebanese Psychiatric Society, and the Beirut Syndicate of Physicians to condemn these practices. The syndicate proceeded to ban their members from cooperating with law enforcement when asked to conduct future anal examinations—though this practice continues illegally in certain parts of the country in the absence of efficient oversight and accountability. In 2013, Antoine Chakhtoura, the mayor of the Dekweneh municipality, a suburb of Beirut, ordered the shutdown of an LGBT-frequented night club, Ghost, after a violent raid by members of the police force where gay and trans* members of the community were illegally arrested and violated by municipal police forces. Helem staged another even larger protest in front of the Palace of Justice against the actions of the mayor, resulting in increased support for the release of the detainees. The incident became the inspiration for Lebanese band Mashrou' Leila’s song Tayf (Arabic: طيف) on their album Ibn El Leil. In 2014, the Lebanese Internal Security Forces police raided the Agha Hammam (a Turkish bathhouse) in the Beirut neighborhood of Hamra after a person in custody alleged that the bathhouse was a meeting place for MSM (males who have sex with males) encounters. Helem protested the raid and, together with other organizations and allies, launched an investigation which revealed the arbitrary arrest and torture of 27 men who were present at the venue. A statement was issued thereafter in which Helem and other organizations denounced the incident as a violent act of homophobia and organized another public protest, this time in front of the infamous Hbeish police station, to release the detainees. In 2015, Helem restructured its mission and vision and expanded its work to include development and humanitarian aid, in addition to human rights advocacy. This included programs that specifically addressed the needs of the massive influx of LGBTQ refugees in Lebanon from Syria and other neighboring countries, as well as prioritization of social and economic rights such as labor, housing, education and healthcare along with decriminalization, hate speech, and civic engagement. In 2019, Helem took part in the October 17 Lebanese Revolution (2019–2021 Lebanese protests) which witnessed an unprecedented level of queer visibility and leadership among the protesters, who mobilized to denounce and oppose rampant levels of government corruption and who called for economic and social reforms for all people in Lebanon. Helem erected a tent in the middle of revolution square under the banner “All of Us Means All of Us (Arabic: كلنا يعني كلنا ) to encourage queer people to take an active part in the protests, to provide a safe space for them to mobilize and organize, as well as to clearly state to protesters the inclusion and involvement of LGBTQ people in the revolution. The tent was destroyed along with the rest of the city by government-aligned vandals on October 29, 2020. Following Lebanon’s political unrest, Helem initiated relief efforts and initiatives in response to the economic collapse which was exacerbated by the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. These relief efforts doubled after the devastating explosion of one of Port of Beirut’s warehouses on August 4, 2020—better known as Beirut explosion—which resulted in a death rate of up to 200 individuals and left 300,000 Beiruti inhabitants displaced, of whom many were members of the LGBTQIA+ community. Helem’s community center was 600 meters away from the epicenter of the blast and suffered extreme damage as a result, though the organization did not suspend its services and activities throughout this period and continues to be a safe space and source of aid for the LGBTQ community in Lebanon. Helem was the first officially-registered and publicly visible LGBT organization in the Middle EastNorth Africa region. On January 23, 2009, the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC) announced Helem as the winner of Felipa de Souza Award in honor of their work to improve LGBTI rights and the rights of those who face discrimination for their HIV status.",Normal

"Gopchang (Hangul: 곱창) can refer to the small intestines of cattle (or large intestines of pig) or to a gui (grilled dish) made of the small intestines. The latter is also called gopchang-gui (곱창구이; ""grilled intestines""). The tube-shaped offal is chewy with rich elastic fibers. In Korean cuisine, it is stewed in a hot pot (gopchang-jeongol, 곱창전골), grilled over a barbecue (gopchang-gui), boiled in soup with other intestines (naejang-tang), or made into a sausage (sundae). In the past, gopchang was a popular, nutritious, and cheap dish for the general public. Rich in iron and vitamins, it was served as a health supplement for improving a weak constitution, recovering patients, and postpartum depression. Today, gopchang is also regarded as a delicacy and is more expensive than the regular meat of the same weight. It is a popular anju (food served and eaten with soju), as it helps break down alcohol. The intestines are cleaned thoroughly, rubbed with wheat flour and coarse salt, and rinsed several times. The fat is trimmed off, and the cleaned gopchang is soaked in water to remove any traces of blood. Garlic, ginger, onion, cooking wine, black pepper, and Korean pepper are common marinating ingredients, mainly used for eliminating any unpleasant odors and tenderizing the meat of gopchang. Ingredients for gopchang-gui marinade are juiced, rather than minced, so that they don't burn during the grilling process. Common ingredients include soy sauce, gochutgaru (chili powder), mullyeot (rice syrup), cheongju (rice wine), onion juice, apple juice, garlic juice, scallion juice, and ginger juice. The gopchang is first marinated in the seasonings and spices, then grilled on a lightly greased pan or griddle. Onions and bell peppers are often grilled together with gopchang. Grilled gopchang is often served dipped in salt and sesame oil. After that, usually Bokkumbab (Hangul: 볶음밥; ""fried rice"") is cooked with Gopchang oil. Gopchang of pork big intestines is usually called dwaeji-gopchang (돼지곱창; ""pig gopchang""). In Korean cuisine, food similar to gopchang prepared with beef blanket tripe is called yang-gopchang (양곱창; ""rumen gopchang""), while the one prepared with beef reed tripe is called makchang (막창; ""last tripe""), and the one with beef large intestines is called daechang (대창; ""big innards""). Internationally, gopchang could be compared to chitterlings (pork's small intestines) or Latin American chunchullo (beef, pork, or lamb's small intestines). The SpanishPortuguese term tripas or the English tripe also occasionally referred to as small beef's intestines, attesting to the practice of consuming animal intestines as a truly worldwide phenomenon. Some foods have tripe in their dishes, such as stir-fried tripe and gopchang jeongol. 'Nak-Gop-Sae(낙곱새)' is a spicy soup with octopus, tripe, and shrimp, and is also loved as a side dish that is sometimes good to eat with alcohol. It is said that this food was first developed in Busan, South Korea.",Normal
"Jonathan Lee Hensley (August 19, 1983 – June 1, 2015) was an American radio personality and artist manager. Best known as the host of the nationally syndicated Are You Ready for the Country? radio program, Hensley interviewed more than a hundred celebrities and entertainers from the launch of his radio career in 2002 until his death in 2015. Hensley was born in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, and graduated from Muhlenberg North High School. At the age of 14, Hensley created the company ""Web Pages R Us"" with classmate Brad Turner to raise money for them to attend a Tom Petty concert. Hensley attended ITT Technical Institute college for two years after high school, and began broadcasting music and interviews from his studio apartment while studying. The internet radio station, DarkSide of the Radio, launched Hensley's career in broadcasting, becoming a highly popular online radio station. Hensley was also a very close friend of the internet personality Angry Grandpa. After dropping out of college in 2003, Hensley launched his first commercial radio show titled Are You Ready for the Country?. The show was eventually syndicated and picked up by over 20 commercial radio stations across the country, and by the age of 25, Hensley had interviewed rock icons such as Chris Robinson, John Paul Jones, Porter Wagoner, Loretta Lynn, Merle Haggard and Kris Kristofferson on the show. The show became known for its diverse content and styles of music, steering clear of popular and current songs while including rock, blues, bluegrass, country and what Gram Parsons used to call ""Cosmic American Music."" Hensley handled new media for a number of recording artists including Al Green and Percy Sledge. He also handled artist management and promotion for acts such as Mark Collie, Goose Creek Symphony, Shooter Jennings and Shane Tutmarc. In 2005, Hensley began handling new media and online contentdesign for rockabilly pioneer Wanda Jackson. He played a role in helping raise awareness about Jackson not being a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, reaching out to Elvis Costello and Bob Dylan to see if they would help raise awareness of it. Costello complied by writing to the nomination committee, sparking a lot of interest for the campaign, while Dylan responded by questioning on-air why Jackson was not a member of the Hall of Fame during his popular radio show broadcast on SiriusXM. Following the successful attempt, Jackson was finally inducted in 2009. Shortly after her induction, Jackson, her husband Wendell Goodman and Hensley were bouncing around ideas for a new recording project, deciding on an album made up of duets with other artists. One of the artists that Hensley reached out to was Jack White of The White Stripes, who accepted and offered to make the record on his Third Man Records label. The collaborative album, The Party Ain't Over, was eventually released in 2011. In the early hours of June 1, 2015, Hensley was found unresponsive in his bedroom by a friend staying at his house, and declared dead soon after. Toxicology results showed alcohol and Xanax in his system and were attributed to his death. He was 31 years old.",Normal
"The Bilberry goat (Irish: Fiaghabhar na bhFraochán) is a breed of feral goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) which is believed to have lived in one herd on Bilberry Rock in Waterford City in the south of Ireland for hundreds of years. Unlike any other breed found in Ireland, the Bilberry herd is thought to be related to Pashmina, Maltese or Cashmere goats. Locals believe they came over with the Huguenots from France over 300 years ago and have lived on Bilberry Rock ever since. The goats are feared close to extinction; numbering only 7 in the year 2000 and 21 in 2005. A group of volunteers formed the Bilberry Goat Heritage Trust in 2000 to protect and support the herd. The population has continued to recover and reached 42 in 2008. The herd is led by a dominant nanny. Bilberry goats are large, with shaggy coats and very large horns. Two members of the British Feral Goat Society, Dr.Shirley Goodyer and Dr. Ray Werner, together with Robert-Jan Prins, a breeder of Dutch Landrace goats, reported that they were ""amazed to see a primitive herd still living in the wild"", and that the goats are a ""unique ancient breed."" The Bilberry Goat Trust was set up to protect these goats from extinction. The 14-acre (5.7 ha) piece of land where they graze used to be a commonage but was sold to a developer who wanted to build houses in the whole area. This would render the Bilberry Herd extinct and appeals were made sparking publicity. Zoning authorities decided to reduce the goats' area to 12.5 acres (5.1ha). The Irish Wildlife Trust is actively involved in the campaign. The feral goat is not a protected species and Bilberry Rock is not a Natural Heritage Area under the Wildlife Act 2000.",Normal

"A peak meter is a type of measuring instrument that visually indicates the instantaneous level of an audio signal that is passing through it (a sound level meter). In sound reproduction, the meter, whether peak or not, is usually meant to correspond to the perceived loudness of a particular signal. The term peak is used to denote the meter's ability, regardless of the type of visual display, to indicate the highest output level at any instant. A peak-reading electrical instrument or meter is one which measures the peak value of a waveform, rather than its mean value or RMS value. As an example, when making audio recordings it is desirable to use a recording level that is just sufficient to reach the maximum capability of the recorder at the loudest sounds, regardless of the average sound level. A peak-reading meter is typically used to set the recording level. In modern audio equipment, peak meters are usually made up of a series of LEDs (small lights) that are placed in a vertical or horizontal bar and lit up sequentially as the signal increases. They typically have ranges of green, yellow, and red, to indicate when a signal is starting to overload. A meter can be implemented with a classic moving needle device such as those on older analog equipment (similar in appearance in some ways to a pressure gauge on a bicycle pump), or by other means. Older equipment used actual moving parts instead of lights to indicate the audio level. Because of the mass of the moving parts and mechanics, the response time of these older meters could have been anywhere from a few milliseconds to a second or more. Thus, the meter might not ever accurately reflect the signal at every instant of time, but the constantly changing level, combined with the slower response time, led to more of an average indication. By comparison, a peak meter is designed to respond so quickly that the meter display reacts in exact proportion to the voltage of the audio signal. This can be useful in many applications, but the human ear works much more like an average meter than a peak meter. The analog VU meters are actually closer to the human ear's perception of sound level because the response time was intentionally slow - around 300 milliseconds, and thus, many audio engineers and sound professionals prefer to use older analog style metering because it more accurately relates to what a human listener will experience in terms of relative loudness.",Normal

"Blackout is the fourth studio album by Dropkick Murphys, released in 2003. A music video for ""Walk Away"", the album's first official single, was also released. The song went on to become a minor radio hit and received some minor airplay on MTV. ""Fields of Athenry"" was also released as a single. The album was released with a DVD, which contained live videos for ""Rocky Road to Dublin"" and ""Boys on the Docks"", a music video for ""Gonna Be a Blackout Tonight"", and a trailer for their then upcoming untitled full-length DVD, which became On the Road With the Dropkick Murphys and was released the following year in March 2004. ""The Dirty Glass"" was originally featured on the 2002 split Face to Face vs. Dropkick Murphys and re-recorded for the album with the band's then merchandise seller, Stephanie Dougherty, who shared vocals with Ken Casey and also appeared on the album's final track, ""Kiss Me, I'm Shitfaced"". The track ""Time to Go"", a homage to the Boston Bruins, was released as a promotional CD for the Bruins and also featured in Tony Hawk's Underground and NHL 2005. The track ""This Is Your Life"" was featured in the 2003 video game Backyard Wrestling: Don't Try This at Home. In 2005, the band released a two-song CD single for the family of Andrew K. Farrar, Jr., a sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps who was killed on January 28, 2005 in Al Anbar, Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Farrar, who was a big fan of the Murphys, made a request to his family that if he did not survive his tour of duty, he wanted their version of ""The Fields of Athenry"" to be played at his funeral. The single features a slower version of ""The Fields of Athenry"" that was originally recorded and placed in Farrar's casket, although the band decided to release the alternate version.

"Raven: The Dragon's Eye is a BBC Scotland children's adventure game show, and the third spin-off to the main series, Raven. It comprises one series, which aired first on the CBBC Channel in 2009. In a similar manner to the previous spin-off, Raven: The Secret Temple, warriors compete as teams and attempt to collect objects (stones, in this series) by completing tasks. Unlike previous Raven series, the opening titles always include a safety message from Raven: ""Our Raven Warriors are always supervised and have their safety checked by experts. Please do not copy the challenges yourself."" Returning from the successful Secret Temple quest and able to unfreeze his homeland, Raven discovers that his arch-enemy Nevar plans to locate the Dragon's Eye, a mystical stone that affords the bearer great power. Determined to stop Nevar from obtaining the Eye, Raven embarks on a quest to destroy it with sixteen of his warriors, who group into teams of four. As Nevar approaches, a new character emerges from the forest— Ervan, former ally of Nevar's under his command— who appears to offer help; Raven must decide whether he is friend or foe. Raven (James Mackenzie): Raven returns to stop Nevar from seizing the Dragon's Eye. Though he is unwilling to reject his assistance outright, Raven grows steadily more suspicious of Ervan as the quest comes to an end. Nevar: Once again, Raven's nemesis takes up the role as the main antagonist of the series. This mysterious creature, clad in black hooded robes and his contorted face hidden behind an iron mask, Nevar hunts for the Dragon's Eye, with which he plans to take over Raven's kingdom. Still with hordes of demons at his command, he proves a difficult obstacle for Raven's warriors to overcome. He has been the re-occurring villain for three series now, Raven: The Island, Raven: The Secret Temple and now Raven: The Dragon's Eye, as well as being the antagonist for the original Raven series. At the end of the final episode, he was seemingly destroyed along with Ervan and the eye itself, but Nevar is seen on the top of the Castle of Shadows and looks on, hinting to more future quests. Ervan (Daniel Jackson): A former soldier under Nevar's command, offering help to Raven and his warriors, and providing Raven with a set of stones that will allow the warriors to be brought back. Wolves: Pennant Run, Spear Strike Bears: Barrel Roll, Shot Hurl Otters: Ring Line, Symbol Square Eagles: Shield Race, Shape Build Archer's Aim: Warriors aim at the targets using a bow and arrow— one stone falls for each hit. Cursed Earth: Warriors use blocks to step over the Cursed Earth trying not to touch the floor and collecting stones as they go. If they touch the floor or run out of time they are eliminated. (Eliminations: Miran, Larim and Nardel of the Bears— all three surviving members of the team were eliminated after mistakenly placing one of their blocks out of bounds. Hareb and Arros of the Wolves— only Hareb was brought back.) Catapult Drop: Warriors use a catapult to knock cages containing stones off giant posts. It is untimed but they have limited amo. Letter Path: One warrior crosses the Letter Path— questions are posed for each step they stand on and the answer begins with that letter. For each incorrect answer a stone is lost. Long Board: Warriors paddle their way on a longboard to collect stones out on the loch. If they fail to make it back in time they are eliminated. (Eliminations: Janot of the Bears— who was brought back) Magnetic Maze: Warriors are underneath a maze. Using a magnet to move another magnet on top towards the hole in the middle to earn stones. Puzzle Count: Questions are on the wall to which the answer is a number. The warriors must step on squares whose combined totals equal the answer to the question. For each mistake a stone is lost. River Rope: Warriors are in a coracle and use a rope to pull themselves along and take stones as they go but if they fall into the river or drift too far away from the ropes they are eliminated. There are two paths to take, an easier route and a harder one with two stones on each path. (Eliminations: Ahrdin of the Eagles— who was not brought back.) The Chest: Warriors work together to use logs to move a large heavy chest towards various keys which are needed to open doors on it that contain stones. When they run out of time the chest disappears. The Climb: Warriors climb up a rock using ropes to aid them collecting stones as they go. Once the time runs out all remaining stones disappear. The Descent: Warriors abseil down a rockface into a boat collecting stones as they go. Thrall Threads: Warriors step between threads which have small bells hung from them. They have to make it to the other side and collect stones as they go. If they ring a bell then the Tree Spirits eliminate them. (Eliminations: Lemec and Cermal of the Wolves— only Lemec was brought back as the team only had enough stones for one warrior, Halsem of the Otters— who was brought back, Janot of the Bears— who could not be brought back as he had already been eliminated, Kelin of the Eagles— who was brought back.) White Water: Warriors are in a boat and paddle down rapids and attempt to collect stones as they go. Rope Reach: The warriors have to collect stones from a rope bridge across a river. Three stones hang within reach of the ropes, but one goes down an unstable ladder and is much harder to retrieve. This one must be retrieved. (Eliminations: Kelin of the Eagles— second and therefore irreversible elimination) The Torrent: This was a race through the river between six warriors, with the first four finishers qualifying to join Varan and Gydan of the Eagles because they had the most stones and went through to the porthole. As the Otters came 2nd with 34 stones they had a head start before the Wolves who came 3rd with 24 stones. In the remainder of the quest, it was Arkil who was 1st to go through, Hareb was 2nd, Lemec was 3rd and Vesak was 4th. It was close because he was in last place in most of the challenge but Halsem struggled to climb the waterfall. Halsem told Kasha that only one person could climb at a time allowing Vesak to catch up. He got the 2nd rope before Kasha did climb the waterfall and overtook Halsem when climbing the waterfall and just beat him to the plunge pool which leads to the porthole. Therefore, the last two warriors Halsem and Kasha were eliminated. Kasha would have got through had she climbed and Halsem not told her to. The six strongest, brightest and bravest warriors continue their quest to destroy the dragons eye but first all 6 of them had to take part in the final leadership trials to see who shall be their leader. Long Throw: The warriors each have two attempts to throw a javelin as far as they can. The top four— in this case, Gydan, Arkil, Hareb and Lemec— move on to the next challenge. Rock Range: The warriors throw three rocks at a target on the ground, trying to get as close to the centre as possible. If the rock does not enter the target, it will not count. The top two– in this case, Gydan and Lemec– move on to the final challenge. Combat Ring: Each warrior must attempt to grab the cloth tied to their opponent's back. The warrior who wins the best of three bouts— in this case, Lemec— earns leadership of the final six. Day 17 River Raft: Using a crossbow and arrows with hooks, the warriors must drag a boat on a river to the shore so they can get in and journey downstream. Hareb was first to shoot and managed to snag a hooked arrow to a large ragged cloth on the boat. However, when the other warriors were pulling it to shore it got stuck to a nearby tree and the arrow came off. Varan was next to fire, but they could not dislodge it from the tree and the arrow fell into the river. Vesak was next to fire and managed to get the arrow in a hole in the cloth, dislodging it from the tree and getting it to shore. River Escape: The warriors must now travel downstream and grab a ladder along the river (like the one in Rope Reach) and climb up it after securing it to the boat. This duty was befallen to leader Lemec who managed to secure the raft to the ladder so that the other warriors could get up it. If any of the warriors fall into the river, they will be lost to the quest. Vesak was trying to get onto the ladder but he did not secure his legs to the ladder and despite Lemec trying to pull him back into the boat, his grip gave in and he fell into the river, eliminating him. Shuttle Line: Using a nearby zipline, the warriors must find a way to cross the river to the other side. However they need to set it up correctly as if any warriors fall in the river they will be lost. Hareb, Arkil and Lemec managed to set it up successfully and the warriors managed to get all the warriors across, despite the zipline needing effort to get them to shore. Demon Shields: Using an unusual mechanism of blocks, the warriors must retrieve shields that will defend them from nearby demons. Lemec, Hareb, Gydan and Arkil managed to escape the demons by retrieving their respective shields, but Varan only just managed to escape after she could not unclip the shield from the rope holding the shield up. Day 18 Demon Trap: Using long boards and paddles, the warriors must cross a lake to the other side of the bank as their path is blocked by quicksand. However, there are demons on the lake who are trying to catch the warriors. If they are caught, they are eliminated. Varan was the last to get her board into on the lake and could not paddle fast enough. She was caught by the demons, making her the second to fail on the journey to the Castle of Shadows. Buried Treasure: Using symbols in the journal they received after the leadership challenges, they must find a series of parchments buried under a series of stones with the same symbols on them. However, they must be careful of approaching demons. Gydan and Arkil were given the responsibility of digging while Hareb and Lemec figured out the symbols. With the four parchments intact, they head to their next challenge. While this challenge is going on, Ervan and Nevar distract Raven and switch Raven's staff for a fake that Ervan crafted in an earlier day. Magic Potion: The remaining warriors now must collect blocks so that they can send one warrior up the stack and retrieve a potion that will reveal what is on the blank parchment. Hareb was given the role of the climber while Lemec gives her the blocks and Gydan and Arkil were given the task of pulling a safety rope so that if Hareb falls, she'll be safe. They retrieve the potion and pour it on the parchments, revealing a map to The Castle of Shadows. Golden Portal: The warriors must decipher an inscription on a stone using a letter guild in the journal. They figure out that the inscription is a riddle, 'In light I am seen, but in darkness, I am'. They figure out that the answer is shadow and Gydan is given the task of firing an arrow into a hole but misses. Hareb is then given the task and then activates the portal to the next part of their journey to the Dragon's Eye. Upon arriving in the Forgotten Kingdom, Raven discovers that his staff was swapped when he tries to destroy one of the guards. Day 19 Demon Patrol: The four remaining warriors must construct a destroyed catapult while the demons patrol the castle perimeter meaning they have to hide when they come close enough that they can see the warriors. If they are spotted they are eliminated from the quest. Having built the catapult and found ammunition, the warriors hide as more guards approach them. Catapult Attack: The warriors must use the catapult and the ammunition in order to fire at the patrolling demons to dispose them. Lemec is first to fire the catapult but misses and the warriors hide. Hareb is next but again misses, causing the warriors to hide again. Arkil is next to fire and manages to hit a demon, but another approaches as Gydan takes the catapult and disposes of the demon. Hareb takes aim again and fared much better than her first attempt. But the warriors hide again as another demon comes too close. Gydan manages to hit him and now they can advance after collecting the weapons that they were carrying. The Gauntlet: Using the shields that they collected on day 17, the warriors must dodge and reflect the aim of the demons that stand on the castle walls above them. If they are hit by any missiles, they are eliminated. By Lemec's instructions, Arkil is told to go first, Gydan second, Hareb third and Lemec who went last. All the warriors survive to move to the castle entrance. Blast Path: The warriors now face a dilemma. The warriors must enter the castle but using a pathway that has been trapped with noxious gas holes. Using the weapons that they collected at Catapult Attack, they must collect the cylinders that hang above their reach and place them in the holes. This challenge was a race, as the last warrior to cross the path would be taken by the gases. Arkil, Hareb and Gydan made it past the path, but leader Lemec could not place the cylinders fast enough and she was eliminated. However, they are now captured after Nevar forced them to enter without Raven, meaning they are trapped. Day 20 Break Out: The warriors have been tied together and watched by a guard. When the demon begins to rest, the warriors escape from their ropes but they can not escape the room they are in until they get rid of the guard by the door. Arkil managed to conceal the journal and the warriors find a recipe for a potion that will vanquish demons. After they make the potion, they throw it onto the demon and he is no more, making their escape. During this challenge, Raven retrieves his real staff back after deflecting a shot by Nevar to Ervan who was holding it. The Force: The final three warriors must now step onto a pathway of symbols that have three in one row and they must step onto the symbols at random and remember the way they have come. If they step on an incorrect symbol, they will be sent back to the start. The first warrior to finish will earn an advantage in the next challenges. That warrior being Arkil, as she managed to remember a symbol that she has stepped on, whereas Gydan (who was also on the same row) stepped onto the wrong symbol. He then finished 2nd and earned an advantage over Hareb as she was last to complete the path. Deadly Ground: The warriors must now cross the castle courtyard by traversing an obstacle course that consists of a climbing net and slice, a balance beam with turning paddles to trip them up and a balance beam with pendulums swinging. Arkil is to go first then followed by Gydan and with Hareb bringing up the rear. Arkil only barely made it to the end as she slips while coming off the balance beam at the end. However, when Gydan slips like Arkil, his foot touches the deadly ground and he is eliminated just before he reaches the lair of the Eye. In the end, Hareb soon joins Arkil as they enter the Eye's lair. The Lair: Now Hareb and Arkil must battle it out in a competition of bravery and fear. After entering a small tunnel cage face up, they must place their hands into 4 boxes containing maggots, snails, hedgehogs and millipedes as they try to find a key in just one of the boxes. Hareb is beaten to the key by Arkil and now only she remains to retrieve the Dragon's Eye. Once at the cage containing the Eye, Arkil must open it, despite rats scurrying around inside of the cage. Once she collects the Eye, she is teleported to the castle courtyard, where Raven is waiting. Ervan then shows up and reveals that it was he who wrote the journal that led Raven and Arkil to the Castle of Shadows. Demanding Arkil to give him the Eye, Ervan threatens the two with stones that were found with the Eye which are deadly upon contact with anything close to the Eye. However, Nevar appears and kills Ervan. Raven then takes the Eye from Arkil. Despite being briefly tempted by the power it possesses, he completes the mission and destroys it with his staff, with Nevar seemingly killed in the blast. Arkil is then given a staff of gold by the Spirit Lord as a reward for Arkil's bravery and strength. She is then known as ""Arkil, protector of the golden staff, savior of the spirits of the forest, hero of the Dragon's Eye"". As Raven and Arkil head off, Nevar is seen on top of the Castle of Shadows, not destroyed as thought. Warriors are given 4, 5 or 6 letter names, chosen from letters from their real names. Sixteen warriors started the quest, and there are four teams of warriors. Each team has four members, with two boys and two girls in each, with the exception of the Wolves. The four leaders were chosen in leadership trials on day one. Lemec was also chosen to be the leader of the final week warriors after a series of trials, but was lost on the Blast Path, leaving no leader for the final day. Warriors in blue cells made it through to the finals, and the warrior in gold was the winner. The warrior in second is silver and bronze for the third. *Not enough stones to be brought back. **Team chose not to bring warrior back. ***Entire team eliminated in one challenge. +Eliminated on one of the final challenges, with no option to be brought back.",Normal

"Christopher Chapman CM RCA (January 24, 1927 – October 24, 2015) was a Canadian film writer, director, editor and cinematographer. Best known for his award-winning 1967 short film A Place to Stand, he also pioneered the multi-dynamic image technique used in films and television shows. Chapman was born in Toronto, shortly after midnight on January 24, 1927, and just minutes after his twin brother Francis. Christopher and his twin had four elder siblings, Philippa, Howard, Robert, and Sally. Another brother, Julian, died in infancy. They were children of distinguished architect Alfred Hirschfelder Chapman (of Chapman and Oxley) and concert pianist Doris Chapman. In the 1950s, Christopher spent a year in England designing cars for the Ford Motor Company before returning to Canada and becoming a filmmaker. Chapman was married to Barbara-Glen Chapman (née Kennedy), his wife of 44 years. He died at the age of 88 on October 24, 2015, at his residence in ReachView Village, a long-term care facility in Uxbridge, Ontario. He was survived by his wife and son Julian Chapman (former Deputy Commander of 4th Canadian Division, Canadian Army Brigadier General). Over his career, Chapman made approximately 40 films for television, the National Film Board of Canada, theatrical release, tourism organizations, science centres, and international expositions. Chapman's first film, The Seasons, won the Canadian Film Award (CFA) for Film of the Year in 1954. In 1965 Christopher and Francis Chapman jointly won the Canadian Film Award for Best Colour Cinematography at the 17th Canadian Film Awards for Expedition Bluenose. Another of his films to win the CFA Film of Year was his 1967 short, A Place to Stand, which also received two Academy Award nominations in 1968, winning the one for Best Live-Action Short. The film, commissioned by the Government of Ontario, featured Chapman's innovative multi-dynamic image technique (or 'the Brady Bunch effect'), wherein moving panes of moving images are used within the single context of the screen. Over a year of filming, Chapman shot 70 kilometres (43mi) of film, which he then edited into 18 minutes, though the images moving across the screen were the equivalent of an hour and three-quarters of film. The process exhausted Chapman and he was still unsure of using it until its first screening occurred: ""There were a couple of stenographers, who were eating their lunch watching the screening, and they were agog,"" Chapman said. ""But I wanted to run. I was exhausted and thought it was a failure, but a chap grabbed me as I was going out the door. He'd been standing at the back of the screening room and said he was blown away by it. It was Steve McQueen."" In 1968, McQueen starred in The Thomas Crown Affair, directed by Norman Jewison, a film that used Chapman's split-screen technique. Jewison added the multiple-image sequences into the film after seeing A Place to Stand. Over the years since, many films and television series have used the technique, with the most recent known to be the American series 24, which, by using the technique, documented the simultaneous actions of its characters. In 1970, Chapman directed a film for the Hudson’s Bay Company, called Impressions, as part of HBC's 300th anniversary celebrations. Impressions, another film of Chapman’s to use his multiple-dynamic technique, follows the HBC's 300-year history using both historic and modern images: iconic images of the fur trade are paired with modern department stores; scenes of farming are shown with oil production are seen, and so on. In 1984, Francis and Christopher Chapman collaborated on a three-dimensional nature film for the nascent Science North. Nominated: Best Documentary Short Subject (40th Academy Awards) Nominated: Best Short Film (Chicago International Film Festival) In addition to his film honors, Chapman was appointed a member of the Order of Canada in 1987 and awarded a Doctor of Laws by Ryerson University in 2000. Chapman served as president of both the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts and the Directors Guild of Canada. He was also a member of The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto.",Normal

"Johann Katzianer (Slovene: Ivan Kacijanar), or Hans Katzianer, Freiherr zu Katzenstein und Fledingen (1491, Begunje (German: Vigaun) – 27 October 1539, Hrvatska Kostajnica) was a Carniolan aristocrat and an Imperial Army commander. He is first mentioned in 1527 when Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor gathered an army to support his claims on the throne of Hungary, which had become vacant after King Louis II of Hungary was killed in the Battle of Mohács (1526) against the Ottomans. Katzianer took part in Ferdinand's Hungarian campaign of 1527–1528 against the voivode of Transylvania, John Zápolya, who had also been proclaimed King, supported by a large faction of the nobility in the Hungarian kingdom. Katzianer distinguished himself in the Battle of Tarcal in September 1527 and especially in the Battle of Szina in March 1528, but alienated himself from the population by the violence and misbehavior of his troops. In 1529 he participated in the Siege of Vienna against Suleiman the Magnificent. At the head of the light cavalry, he harassed the retreating Turks and liberated many Christian prisoners. In 1530, he replaced bishop Krištof Ravbar as the governor (Landeshauptmann) of Duchy of Carniola. He served in that post until 1538 when he was replaced by Nikola Jurišić. After the death of Nicholas, Count of Salm in the same year, he was named commander in chief (Obristfeldhauptmann) of the troops in Hungary, where he held off under difficult circumstances new attacks from John Zápolya and Suleiman the Magnificent. He gained a great victory in the Battle of Leobersdorf (1532) where he destroyed a Turkish army led by Kasim Bey. In 1537 he was commander of an army of 24,000 men to besiege Osijek. The Katzianer's Campaign was a complete disaster and Katzianer was blamed for fleeing and abandoning his army to be annihilated in the Battle of Gorjani. He was arrested and sent to Vienna to be tried but escaped before the verdict on 31 January 1538 to Fortress Kostajnica in Croatia. Here he contacted enemies of the Habsburgs to plot against Ferdinand, but the young Count Nikola IV Zrinski had him murdered and was stabbed during dinner.",Normal

"Robert Neville St George (2 July 1897 – 27 October 1980) was a rugby league footballer. He represented the New Zealand rugby league team in 2 test matches in 1925. In the process he became the 178th player to represent New Zealand. He also represented the North Island and Auckland representative side. St George played his club rugby league in Auckland for the Marist Old Boys side initially before moving to Devonport United (North Shore Albions) where he spent most of his career. Robert Neville St George was born on July 2, 1897, in the Auckland suburb of Papatoetoe, New Zealand. While his first name was Robert he went by Neville for much of his life, reverting back to Robert later. His parents were Lillian Neville, and Robert Montgomery St George. Robert Sr. had been born in Papakura, Auckland, in 1874 and Lillian had come to New Zealand as an infant and lived in Onehunga, Auckland. Lillian died on October 12, 1916, aged 42 when Neville was 19 years old and his father Robert remarried in 1919 to Fanny Jewell Huxtable. Neville’s religion was stated as being Presbyterian on his enlistment form. He had 6 siblings, the eldest born in 1886 was unnamed in the New Zealand Births, Deaths and Marriages records, Stewart Lyell (b.1899), Lillian Edith Melba (b.1903), Laurel Margaret (b.1906), Ella Mavis (b.1908), and Allen Alfred St George (b.1910). Allen, better known as Ed would also go on to represent New Zealand at rugby league in 1932 and the two hookers would directly oppose each other on two occasions in club rugby league in 1930. Neville was a fitter by trade and at the time of his enlistment in World War 1 was living at Pine Lodge, Great North Road, Grey Lynn. His last employer at the time was “Westfield Freezing Works, Westfield” and he had spent some time living at 53 Williamson Avenue in late 1917. He also listed 24 Bond Street in Devonport as an address. It was this suburb that he would spend much of his following years living in. St George enlisted for the war effort on 18 October, 1917 and embarked on April 23, 1918, on board the Willochra, disembarking in the Suez. St George served overseas for 1 year, 32 days. He suffered from influenza at one point and was admitted to hospital on October 18, 1918, then again was taken to hospital on February 3, 1919, before being considered no longer physically fit for war service “on account of illness contracted on active service” though the war was in its final stages by this point. St George was discharged on July 25, 1919. He was awarded the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. Soon after returning from the war St George joined the newly formed Marist Old Boys rugby league club who had been admitted to the first grade championship in their inaugural season of 1919. He had recently turned 22 years of age. On July 26 he was listed in the match day squad for the seniors against North Shore Albions for their Roope Rooster round 1 match but it is unlikely he took the field. He appears to have made his debut on August 16 in their semi final loss to Maritime 22-21. He took Marist’s goal kicks and the Auckland Star wrote that “St George did quite well at goal kicking. If he had made the same success of some of the easy kicks as he did of a very difficult one his side would have been the conquerors”. He converted their second try before he had “a shot at goal from between the halfway and twenty-five lines,  a beautiful goal just as halftime sounded” to make the score 11-10 to Maritime. He played in a curtain raiser between Marist and Maritime on September 20 which acted as a curtain raiser to the match between Auckland v Australia match at Carlaw Park. The 1920 season saw St George establish a regular spot in the playing thirteen of the Marist 1st grade side. He was also elected on to their management committee. He played in 11 of their 13 matches. His only points of the season came in round 2 when he kicked a penalty goal in a 5-5 draw with Newton Rangers. After a round 3 loss to Maritime at Victoria Park before a crowd of 3,000 the Observer newspaper said that he and Tait “were the most prominent forwards”. The following week he was part of the Marist side which won the clubs first ever match on the first grade competition after they had failed to register a victory in 1919. The only other specific mention of him during a match report was after a 10–5 win over City Rovers in the final round of the first grade championship on the Auckland Domain before a crowd of 6,000. During the second half “the Marist forwards broke away, and St George, getting the ball, had a clear run for a try, but was outpaced and tackled close to the line”. With the win the Marist side finished the season in third place with a 7 win, 1 draw, 3 loss record. The 1921 season saw St George play only about 2 matches for Marist which were at the beginning of the season. The newspapers published squad lists and St George’s name was appearing well beyond the first thirteen names listed from rounds 3 onwards. Then at the July 13 Auckland Rugby League management committee meeting he had his transfer request to North Shore Albions approved. It is unknown if he had requested a transfer due to not receiving playing time for Marist or because he had moved to the Devonport area where North Shore were based. After transferring to Devonport United, St George made his first grade debut almost immediately, playing for them against Ponsonby on July 16 in the first round of the Roope Rooster at the Auckland Domain. Devonport lost the match 34-11. Just two weeks later St George was selected to play in an Auckland trial match to help select two touring teams to travel south. He was chosen in the Probables side in the prop position. The match was to be a curtain raiser to the Auckland match against Wellington at the newly opened Carlaw Park. St George missed selection for the Auckland tour and it was his last match for the season. The 1922 season was very different for St George. He played in 15 matches for the Devonport first grade side and also played in 4 representative or trial matches. In Devonport’s first championship match of the season at the Devonport Domain he scored 2 tries and kicked a penalty in a 32–17 loss to City. His first try came a “after a scramble on City’s line  managed to notch a try”, while the second came after he chased a long kick and he “picked the leather up and dashed over”. He also set up their last try with a cross field kick. Then on full time St George featured in their final try after he “kicked over the City line”, with Alf Scott scoring. He played in 4 further matches before being mentioned in a match report for the 20-8 loss to Ponsonby. The Auckland Star said that “the best of the Devonport forwards were  Scott, St George, and Wheeler, and in the backs Stan Webb, Bert Laing, and Tommy Taylor”. Laing was a current New Zealand rugby league international, and Webb would go on to become one in the mid 1920s. Against City on July 1 it was reported that “St George and  Hand were prominent among the pack” for Devonport. On July 15 in a 21–7 win over Fire Brigade he set up a try when he picked up “and sent the ball out to Douglas who scored”. He missed the conversion. The Star said that he played “a great game” along with several other members of their forward pack. He scored a try and kicked a conversion in a 37–15 win over Richmond Rovers at the Auckland Domain. His try came after he took a pass from Douglas near the line following a long run down field by Wheeler whose kick was gathered by Douglas. St George then played 3 more matches for Devonport before being selected in the Auckland B team to play Cambridge. The full Auckland team was playing Hawke's Bay at Carlaw Park on the same day. The match was played at Victoria Square in Cambridge and saw Auckland B win 22-8. After the match the Waikato Independent newspaper said that in the middle stages “St George was hooking to advantage for the visitors, and the visiting rear guard began a series of rear guard movements which were fine to watch”. He took a conversion attempt late in the match which missed. St George played in Devonport’s final match of the season which was Roope Rooster first round loss to City before being selected to play for Auckland Province against the touring New South Wales side. The Auckland Province side was a team selected from the greater region including the Waikato which at the time included the 'South Auckland' competition which was based in the northern Waikato. The teams were however generally dominated by Auckland club players. The match was played at the Auckland Domain before a crowd of over 5,000 and saw New South Wales win narrowly, 21-20. Then on October 7, St George was selected to make his full Auckland debut in a match against a newly formed and short lived Bay of Plenty team at the Tauranga Domain. St George played at prop, with Wally Somers in the hooking position. Auckland won the match 33 points to 26. The 1923 season saw St George play 14 matches for Devonport but no representative matches at all. His only points were a single conversion in a match against Newton on July 28, and a conversion against City on September 8. Following the later match he was chosen in the reserves for Auckland Province in a match against Auckland but he did not take the field. The 1924 season saw St George play 17 matches for Devonport and once again he was not selected for any representative matches. After Devonport’s round 2 match against Ellerslie United he was said to be prominent among their players. The following week St George was sent off midway through the second half for the first time in his career along with future New Zealand representative Alf Townsend of City. They were opposing hookers and there had been issues with the scrum with the New Zealand Herald commenting “the action of the referee, Mr  Bull, in sending the City and Devonport hookers off the field on Saturday, might be taken as the first step on the part of referees to make a serious attempt to improve the scrums”. Two weeks later against Ponsonby he was said to be “prominent” along with captain Alf Scott. Following a win over Athletic on June 21 the Herald said that “St George is a much improved player, and is a tower of strength to his side”. His only points of the season came in a 32–13 win over Mangere Rangers at Victoria Park. His successful conversion gave Devonport a 27-0 lead. He appeared to only attempt goal kicks occasionally for Devonport and mostly late in matches. The Auckland Star in the same match said that St George was “always to the fore in forward movements” along with Jim O'Brien. Devonport were having their best season since 1916 when they came second in the championship. After 15 matches Devonport had a 11 win, 1 draw, 3 loss record, while Marist Old Boys were 2 points behind them but with a game in hand. The Auckland Rugby League decided to make the two teams play off for the title and Marist won narrowly by 20 points to 17 before a club record crowd of 17,000 at Carlaw Park. The 1925 season was the busiest and most significant of St George’s career. He played in 22 matches, including 4 for Auckland, 1 for the North Island, and his only 2 appearances for New Zealand. In a round 4 loss to Ponsonby it was said that “St George’s hooking of the ball in the scrums was a feature of the play, and he beat a recognised hooker like Lowrie badly”. A week later in a match with Athletic he “gave his side a good share of the ball and in this department he has shown much improvement”. After 4 further matches for Devonport, St George was named as a reserve for an A and B team trial but was then named for the Auckland C team to play South Auckland on June 27. Ultimately however he did end up playing for the Auckland A team against Auckland B. Auckland B lost the match 5 points to 0 at Carlaw Park. After the match was completed St George took a place on the reserve bench for the North Island team to play the South Island in the inaugural inter island match. Typically reserves did not take the field as they were only permitted to replace injured players, and often this was only allowed in the first half of matches. However during the first half Alf Townsend, the North Island hooker, broke a rib and did not take the field for the start of the second half, instead being replaced by St George. The North Island led 11-7 at the break and went on to win 27 points to 9 in rainy, muddy conditions. After the match the New Zealand selectors chose the 23 man touring squad to travel to Australia. St George was not selected and the Auckland Star stated: “St George (Devonport) is a hooker who must have just missed a trip”. Prior to the New Zealand teams departure they played against Auckland with St George hooking for the local side. The New Zealand side won 16-9. During the first half the Herald said that “St George kept beating Lowrie for the ball” in the scrums. St George then returned to the Devonport side for their second to last match in the championship. They defeated Newton Rangers 11-3 with it said that “St George, in the forwards, played a fine game, showing to good advantage in the loose play”. They lost their last match and finished in 4th place of the 7 sides. His final matches for them in the season were their 15-12 first round win over his former side Marist in the Roope Rooster and their 22-11 semi final loss to City on August 15. St George was selected for the Auckland team to play the returning New Zealand side from Australia. He was called into the side to replace the unavailable Alf Townsend for the August 29 match. Auckland was well beaten, by 41 points to 27 in the match at Carlaw Park before a crowd of over 15,000. Early in the match Arthur Singe picked the ball “up off the ground  whipped the leather to St George, who scored in a good position”. After the conversion the score was tied at 5-5. St George was then named in the New Zealand test side to play against the touring Queensland side. His weight was given as 13 stone, 3 pounds. The Auckland Star said “St George, who has given some fine exhibitions of hooking this season, will be making his first appearance in big football, but he has earned his place and can be relied upon to get his share of the ball”. He would be between his Devonport team mate Jim O'Brien, and Ernie Herring of Athletic and was matched against Jim Bennett who played had played 3 matches for Australia in 1924 and would represent Queensland on 36 occasions from 1921 to 1930. The first test was played on September 5 at Carlaw Park and saw 18,000 spectators in attendance. New Zealand won a thrilling match by 25 points to 24. Queensland had led 19 to 5 at one point before a spirited comeback by the New Zealand side with St George involved in several attacking movements. After the match the Auckland Star said that “Herring, Singe and St George were good”. He was then named in the Auckland side to play the tourists in a midweek fixture, once again matched up with Jim Bennett. This time he stood between Jim O'Brien once more and his name sake Jim O'Brien of Marist Old Boys. Auckland drew the match 18-18 once again at Carlaw Park before a crowd of 6,000. St George was then selected for the New Zealand side for the second test, again at Carlaw Park, on September 13. This time his propping partner would be the Marist version of Jim O'Brien and Ernie Herring once more on his other side. And for the third time he was against Jim Bennett in the middle of the Queensland front row. The Devonport Jim O'Brien dropping back into the second row. Queensland ran out comfortable winners by 35 points to 14. The Herald said that “the visiting forwards played solidly and won the ball from the scrum on the majority of occasions, although the New Zealand hooker, St George, did his part well”. St George’s final match of the season was for Auckland in a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against South Auckland. After trailing for some time Auckland came back strongly to win 36 to 19. St George scored Auckland's final try late in the match after he “broke away and ran over to score” with Frank Delgrosso converting. In 1926 St George played 3 matches for Auckland, and played in a New Zealand trial to help the selectors pick the 26 man touring side for the England and Wales tour. He only played 10 games for Devonport during the season after suffering an injury in their season opening match against Ponsonby on April 24. In the match he was well matched by Ponsonby hooker, Stevens, but Devonport lost Lyall Stewart to injury after 20 minutes and then in the second half they lost Julius Laing and Clarence Webb also to injury and ended up with just 3 players in their forward pack (St George, Jim O'Brien, and Horace Dixon). Devonport had lead 21-16 at the time but could not hold on and lost 31-21. The New Zealand Herald said that “St George aided his team by securing a good share of the ball from the scrum”. The newspaper made no mention of St George’s injury but noted that “in at least three cases,  so severe that it will be many weeks before they can again assist their teams”. The following week they lost to Richmond and it was said “Devonport missed their hooker, St George, and rarely got possession from the scrums”. He returned to play in round 6 on June 5, in a win over City 14-5 where he kicked a conversion. It was Devonport’s first win of the season after at one stage having “eight of their best players on the side-line with injuries”. “The winners were reinforced by Webb, Cleaver, Stewart and St George, all good players who had been injured early in the season, and there is no doubt that the quartet made a big difference”. After the June 12 matches the Herald speculated on who might be selected for the New Zealand side and said “among the local players there is no outstanding hooker, but several get their share of the ball every Saturday. St George (Devonport) has represented New Zealand in this position on several occasions, and has often met with success. Somers (Newton) is perhaps the best hooker in the code, but his play is not up to representative standard. No forward, however, has greater claims than Townsend (City), whose success against Queensland last season is readily recalled…”. The following week Devonport played Ponsonby and “St George and Lowrie about evenly divided the hooking honours”. St George was then picked in a 20 man Auckland squad to go into training to play against Waikato on June 26. The choice of hooker was between him and Townsend and in the end the selectors chose Townsend with St George on the reserve bench. On July 3 St George played in a New Zealand trial match for an A Team against a B Team, although the match was a curtain raiser to the inter-island match between the North Island and South Island. His 'A Team' lost 25 points to 16 at Carlaw Park. In a 31-13 Devonport win over Marist Old Boys on July 24 “St George made an opening and sent Len Scott away with a 40 yards run” for a try. He was also involved in a try to Allan Seagar. It was reported that he “gave his side the greater share of the ball from the scrums and also showed good form I other departments. After the match he was named in the Auckland reserves to meet the New Zealand team which was departing for the tour of England and Wales. He was then named in the starting side, with Townsend unavailable. The Auckland side won easily by 52 points to 32 before a crowd of 14,000. St George kicked a conversion late in the match which gave Auckland a 47-24 lead. He was then chosen for the Auckland squad to prepare for a match against Otago. St George’s failure to make the New Zealand touring side was commented on in the Auckland Star in early August:"" Carroll is a failure as a hooker and why the selectors preferred him to St George or Townsend is hard to understand"". In the match between Auckland and the touring side the Herald said “St George has on many occasions proved himself a capable hooker, but on Saturday he was at his best and outplayed Carroll, his vis-à-vis. Auckland gained the ball from scrums with monotonous regularity”. St George supposedly next played for Auckland in their match with Otago at Carlaw Park on August 7. He was named in the match day side at prop but was not mentioned in match reports and prop Harry Douglas who was not named in the side reportedly came off injured so it is more likely he didn't play. Auckland won by 14 points to 4 to retain the Northern Union Challenge Cup. Auckland of course were missing 14 of their players from selection who had gone on tour. He was selected again for Auckland in their match with Canterbury on August 28. Auckland won by 33 points to 15 before a crowd of 7,000 at Carlaw Park. He played in 3 further matches for Devonport to finish the season including in their Roope Rooster final loss to Richmond Rovers on October 16. A week prior he had been named as a reserve in Auckland’s match with South Auckland but did not play. Early in 1927 it was rumoured that St George and Alf Townsend had been approached by the newly formed City rugby union club to play for them. The City delegate to the Auckland Rugby Union had said that they would not poach rugby players and would “include not more than two ex-League players”. Then on 5 April Mr. J.J. Hamill, chairman of Auckland Rugby League received a letter from P. Kelly and “certified by A.C. Townsend and R.N. St George : “You will probably have read the report of the Rugby Union’s meeting in last Tuesday’s ‘Star’ and note the statement that the new City club would countenance no pirating from the existing rugby clubs or from another code. For your information I shall explain that on two occasions during the last three weeks a deputation (whose names were given) waited on Messrs R.N. St George and A.C. Townsend at the Newmarket railway workshops, the object being to induce the league players named to join up with the new City rugby union club. It is pleasing to record the loyalty of the two league players and the failure of the deputation”. In April, St George was selected to train for the Auckland match against the returning New Zealand team from their controversial England and Wales tour which had seen 7 players eventually banned for life for striking during the tour. He was listed in the reserves for the match but ultimately played in place of Townsend. Auckland won the match by 24 points to 21. He was opposed by Jim Parkes at hooker and it was noticed by reporters that the New Zealand forwards remained in the scrum until the ball was hooked clear. They had been criticised in England for breaking from the scrum too early and not supporting their hooker enough. They noted that “Parkes was therefore more than able to hold his own with the opposing hooker, St George”. They went on to say that “St George raked splendidly” and “gave his side plenty of the ball”. St George’s first game for Devonport came in their opening match of the championship on May 7 against City Rovers. He was once again up against one of his hooking rivals, Alf Townsend. City won the match 23-19 but the Auckland Star said that “St George ranking with a larger share of success than his vis-a-vis”. He kicked a conversion in a 12–8 loss to Marist, and then a penalty in a 47–3 win over Grafton as well as setting up a try. In their next match with Richmond Rovers, won by Devonport 17-13 St George kicked a penalty but was later sent off after having words with the referee. Shortly afterwards Stewart (Richmond), Stan Prentice (Richmond), and Jim O'Brien (Devonport) were also sent off. At this point of the season the Auckland Star wrote a review of the season and when discussing the prospects of the hookers for possible representative honours said “there are two first rate players in Lowrie and Somers, with St George and A. Townsend for a further choice”. These four players were the dominant hookers in Auckland for the greater part of the 1920s. In Devonport’s match with Ponsonby on June 11 St George scored a rare try in their 9-6 win at Carlaw Park before 7,000 spectators. He “plunged over” after picking up the ball near the line in muddy conditions after Horace Dixon was tackled on the line and the ball rolled free. He was singled out by the Auckland Star which said “St George is deserving of worthy mention for the reason that he invariably beat a champion hooker in Lowrie for the ball in the set scrums”. While the Herald said “the wet turf suited St George, who played his best game this season”. He scored again the following week in a 32–8 win over Newton Rangers at the Devonport Domain before 1,000 local supporters. His try came “from a melee in midfield,  secured and threaded his way through the opposition, crossing well out”. He was given kicking duties late in the match but missed both conversion attempts. The next time Devonport played Ponsonby St George was up against Kenneth Peckham at hooker. The Sun newspaper said that “Ken Peckham, who hooked for the Ponies, is after the style of a rugby hooker, inasmuch as he works with one leg. But it did not take the veteran leaguer, St George, very long to see this weak point, and he wasted no time in “cooking” Ken’s tactics in the front row”. He was then selected as a reserve for Auckland’s match with Buller. Wally Somers had been selected at hooker but had broken a bone in his foot, however St George also became unavailable and Joseph Peckham came into the side. He was then picked to play for Auckland against South Auckland on October 15 but declared himself unavailable on the Friday. Unusually Auckland chose not to play a recognised hooker and instead used Payne, and they lost the match 29-12 and the Northern Union Challenge Cup for the first time in 5 years. He finished his season playing for Devonport in a charity match for the unemployment fund against Ponsonby on October 22. The 1928 season saw St George play 13 games for Devonport. After a 24-6 round 1 win over City the Auckland Star said that he showed “excellent form” along with others in their forward pack. Then, following a 12–7 win in round 4 over Richmond the Herald said that he had gained “the ball time and again”. The Sun newspaper featured a portrait photograph of him and said “without the services of St George there is just the possibility that Shore may have lost the game. As a hooker St George, a big hefty fellow, is a crack-a-jack, and from 90 percent of the scrums he got the ball, and this gave the “black” rearguard members some golden opportunities which in many cases they took full advantage of”. He missed the next match against Ponsonby with his place taken by Ernest Ruby. They “sadly missed  services” with Ponsonby dominating the scrums. With the representative season approaching the newspapers noted that St George and Wally Somers “have shown enough form to warrant serious consideration when it comes to choosing a hooker”. The Sun said in the same week that “St George, that invincible hooker, can always be relied upon to secure the ball from the majority of the scrums”. He was chosen in the reserves for Auckland’s first match of the season against South Auckland, with Somers preferred at hooker. A few weeks later he played against Somers when Devonport met Newton on June 30. Newton won 23-16 at Carlaw Park with the Herald saying “St George surprised by his ability in getting the ball from the scrums against such a fine hooker as Somers. It was only in the final stages when the Devonport forwards were tiring that Somers gained the advantage, which up to that point was in favour of his opponent”. Following a match against Marist Old Boys on July 7, St George was selected for an Auckland Possibles team to play a trial. He was opposed by Gordon Campbell of Marist in the midweek match. It was said that “there was not a great deal between St George and Campbell as hookers on the full run of the day, but the Devonport man was a shade the best, and has the physique for the middle of the front arch”. He was chosen in the practice squad for the Auckland match with Canterbury on July 21 but was only picked in the reserves for the match with Payne chosen at hooker. He was however selected to start in Auckland’s next match against South Auckland on July 25 but was replaced by Somers before the match. St George was then chosen in the reserves for the Auckland Province to play the touring England side on August 8. However he replaced Bob Stephenson from the Waikato in the starting side. He was matched up again Ben Halfpenny, the St. Helens R.F.C player. England won the match by 14 points to 9 before 15,000 spectators at Carlaw Park. St George then returned to the Devonport side which won their 3rd first grade championship after a 14 year wait since their previous wins in 1913 and 1914. A picture of the victorious side was taken after their win over Ellerslie which sealed the title on September 1. He then played in the Stormont Shield final against Marist with Devonport losing 9-8. He showed ""clear cut superiority in the scrums"". It appeared as though St George had semi retired from the sport as he did not start the 1929, missing their first 4 matches. It was speculated in the Sun newspaper after 3 matches that “it is on the cards that St George and ”Snowy” Dixon may be seen out with Devonport in the big game next Saturday. League fans would welcome their return. St George is one of the finest hookers in the game in Auckland”. A week later it was confirmed that he would indeed return in the round 5 match against Richmond Rovers. The Sun said “with its last season’s hooker, St George, back in the fold, Shore will probably see more of the ball in the scrum downs than Richmond…”. Devonport won 15 to 7, and then in a 24 to 9 win the following week against Newton “St George gave his side a good share of the ball”. His third game of the season was significant in that it was his 100th first grade match for Devonport. A feat achieved by relatively few players in Auckland club rugby league. The match was drawn 13-13 with the Sun reporting that ""St George was also in the limelight a good deal, although in the scrums he was not seeing so very much of the ball against the Marists hooker Campbell"". St George ultimately played in 13 games for Devonport but was not selected for any representative matches. He had turned 32 in July and was now in the later stages of his career. Devonport finished runner up to Ponsonby in the 1st grade championship with an 11 win, 1 draw, 3 loss record. The two teams had been tied after round 14 and a playoff for the title was required with Ponsonby winning 5-0 before a crowd of 11,000. Alf Scott and Syd Rule were said to be Devonport’s best forwards but were “well supported by St George and Dixon”. His last match of the season was against Huntly in Huntly on September 14. He was up against Bob Stephenson, the man he had replaced the previous season in the Auckland Provincial side which played England. The Sun reported that “hooking honours were fairly even. St George had nothing on Stephenson, who is noted for his tenacity in sticking to the ball”. The 1930 season was to be St George’s last playing. He turned out in 13 matches for Devonport after speculation at the start of the season that he may be retiring. The NZ Truth reported that “St George is an unlikely starter”. In the meantime his younger brother Allen Alfred St George, better known as Ed, made his debut for Newton Rangers. He was also a hooker and was said to have played a “good game”. Neville St George’s first match came in round 4 against Ellerslie at the Devonport Domain with Ellerslie upsetting the home side 13-5. A week later he “hooked well” in their loss to City and “had things all his own way in the scrum” with City’s representative hooker out. He was singled out by the newspapers in several matches and then on July 5 he came up against his brother for the first time when Devonport met Newton at Carlaw Park in the main match. Devonport won the match 5 points to 0. Neville played well while the Auckland Star said “another St George was one of the shining lights in the Newton pack”. The older St George’s only points of the season came in round 10 against Richmond. He scored a try under the posts after securing the ball from “a scrimmage on the Richmond line” to give his side an 11-7 lead but they were defeated 14-13. The following round Devonport travelled to the Ellerslie Racecourse to meat the local side and won 12-8. Despite having recently turned 33 he was said to be “outstanding”. In a heavy loss to Ponsonby on August 30 the Star said that he “worked with a will” while the Herald said that he “stood out as the best forward on the ground”. The Sun said that he “played one of his best games of this season”. Then on September 6 he played against his brother once more when Devonport met Newton in a first round Roope Rooster match. It was reported that “Nev. St George won a fair number of scrums for Devonport and was conspicuous in the heavy going throughout”, while ‘St George junior compared well with his brother, getting the ball in the scrums”. The Sun said “St George, hooking in the black scrum, beat the Newton man almost every time”. Neville played in 2 more matches for Devonport, against Ponsonby on September 13, and then City on September 27. This match was a play in game to make the Stormont Shield final. It appears that this was his final match and that he did not play in the Stormont Shield final on October 4 which Devonport won 17-5. St George required from the game after 12 seasons in senior rugby league. Neville St George spent much of his life living in the Devonport suburb where his rugby league side was based. In 1925 he was living at 24 Bond Street, Devonport and was an engineer by trade. After retiring it appears that he moved to the Papatoetoe area in South Auckland and became involved with the Papatoetoe rugby league club, being listed as their auditor after their annual general meeting in 1931. It appears he may have held this position as early as 1927. Neville was a member of the Grand Lodge of England Freemasons with his name appearing on their register in 1920, with his father Robert also a member. Neville married Ada May Waymouth in 1920 on the 14th of April. They were married at St. James Manse. In the marriage notice in the Auckland Star it was said that his father was living in Mangere at the time, and that his wife Ada was the second daughter of Mr. H.R. Waymouth of Devonport. Neville appears to have reverted his name back to Robert Neville St George at some point in his life, as many records have it listed this way and his gravestone is also written this way. It appears as though the couple did not have any children. According to census and electoral roll records the couple lived in Papatoetoe throughout the 1940s and St George continued to work as an engineer and ironically the street they lived on in Papatoetoe was St George Street where they lived at 86. His father, Robert Montgomery St George died on January 27, 1946, in Otahuhu, Auckland. By 1954 Neville and Ada had moved to 114 St George Street in Papatoetoe where they still lived up until at least 1969 according to electoral records. His wife Ada died on December 4, 1978, in Takapuna, Auckland. Neville died two years later on October 27, 1980, in Auckland. He was buried at O'Neill’s Point Cemetery in Belmont, Auckland in the same grave site as his wife.",Normal
"TR-196 (Technical Report 196) is a Broadband Forum technical specification. Its official title is ""Femto Access Point Service Data Model."" The purpose of this Technical Report is to specify the Data Model for the Femto Access Point (FAP) for remote management purposes using the TR-069 CWMP. FAP is a generic terminology that implies any Radio Access Technology (RAT). In 3GPP's terminology, Home Node B is the name for 3G (UMTS) and Home eNode B for LTE. There are two major releases (""Issue"" in BBF terminology) of TR-196 data model. Issue 1 is the first publication which supports UMTS HNB only. It was later expanded to include LTE HeNB and CDMA2000 FAP, and was released as Issue 2. TR-196 is a specification of Broadband Forum (BBF). But its work is closely related to 3GPP's work on HNB and HeNB, and 3GPP2's work on femtocell. In turn, 3GPP and 3GPP2's work were originally driven by the activities in Femto Forum (now called Small Cell Forum). Most of the work for the first publication of TR-196 was done within Femto Forum. The work was later submitted to 3GPP SA WG5 to standardize it as respective Technical Specifications (TS). It led to the collaboration between 3GPP and Broadband Forum to officially publish it as BBF Data Model called TR-196. When Femto Forum (current Small Cell Forum) was launched in 2007, one of the main issues in the Femtocell industry was the lack of standardized femtocell architecture, including the standardized O&M framework. In order to avoid the fragmentation in the market, Femto Forum initially focused on these areas. As the Forum reached consensus, the leading companies brought the joint proposal to 3GPP to standardize the HNB architecture. The standardization in the signalling (Control Plane) architecture later resulted in Iu-h interface in 3GPP. It includes the specification of signalling protocol Home Node B Application Part (HNBAP) and RANAP User Adaptation (RUA). The Data Model was subsequently published by Broadband Forum as TR-196 Issue 1 (Femto Access Point Service Data Model). It is based on Broadband Forum's TR-069 CWMP as the signalling protocol. In the second half of 2008, Femto Forum reached agreement on O&M framework to be based on Broadband Forum's TR-069 CWMP as the signalling protocol. This followed the Forum's O&M subgroup to start the HNB Data Model work. It included the definition of object organization and parameters, including the detail XML editing work. At the same time, leading companies proposed a new Work Item (WI) in 3GPP SA WG5 (SA5) for the specification of HNB Data Model (""Information Model"" in SA5's terminology). It resulted in the WI ""UTRA HNB: 3G Home NodeB OAM&P Type 1 Management Interface."" It is worth noting that it was the first time that 3GPP SA5 created specification for Type 1 interface (management interface between Element Manager (EM) and Network Element (NE)). Up to this point, Type 1 interface has been vendor implementation specific only. The specification work in 3GPP SA5 results in the following set of Technical Specifications (TS): The second TS (TS 32.582) defines the ""Information Model"" for HNB. During the specification work, it was decided that the Data Model itself is to be owned and published by the Broadband Forum (BBF) rather than 3GPP SA5 to have the ownership of it. This agreement led to the collaboration between 3GPP SA5 and BBF. Then BBF subsequently published the Data Model as the BBF specification TR-196 Issue 1. After the completion of 3GPP Release 8, a group of companies proposed a new WI ""Enhanced Home NodeB eNodeB: 3G HNB and LTE HeNB OAM&P Type 1 Interface"" to define Data Model for LTE Home eNode B. This work in 3GPP SA5 resulted in the following set of Technical Specifications (TS): The second TS (TS 32.592) defines the ""Information Model"" for HeNB. This time, all detail work including object parameter definitions and the detail XML editing work was done by 3GPP SA5. The reality was that the same set of small group of core people did much of the work in both Issue 1 and Issue 2. Based on the collaboration framework that was established between 3GPP SA5 and BBF at the time of publication of Issue 1, the former liaised with BBF to publish the new Data Model. At the same time, 3GPP2 established similar collaboration framework with BBF to standardize the CDMA2000 FAP Data Model. BBF took inputs from both 3GPP and 3GPP2, merged them into a single Data Model. At this time BBF saw that there are some issues with the resulting Data Model and saw the need to re-organize it. This includes extracting commonly used objects and parameters, and aligning other existing BBF Data Models. This resulted in moving some parts of the objects parameters in original Issue 1 to another BBF Data Model, creating a separate Data Model specification, and re-organizing some of the existing object parameter structure and definition. As a result, Issue 2 became non-backward compatible with Issue 1. Issue 1 defines Data Model for UMTS HNB only. Therefore, Issue 1 content aligns with 3GPP TS 32.582 (TS 32.582 is a high-level definition of objects and parameters only). Issue 2 expands Issue 1 by including LTE HeNB and 3GPP2's FAP Data Model. UMTS HNB part still aligns with 3GPP TS 32.582. In addition, LTE HeNB part aligns 1-to-1 with 3GPP TS 32.592. As discussed in the earlier section on the historical background of Issue 2, Issue 2 is not backward-compatible with Issue 1 Data Model. This implies that migrating from Issue 1 to Issue 2 requires complete change in the Data Model support and implementation in the software. This can potentially lead to migration issue in commercial deployment.",Normal
"Philip Arantz (1929–1998) was a detective sergeant in the New South Wales Police. During the early 1970s, Arantz achieved Australian fame when he became involved in a long-running and highly publicised battle with the New South Wales government after having been dismissed from his job. Arantz claimed that he had been victimised for his whistle-blowing actions, which had exposed systematic police corruption. In 1971, while working on a computerisation program, Arantz discovered that the NSW police service had been systematically under-reporting crime statistics for years. The obvious conclusion from this revelation was that police were trying to conceal corruption, which allegedly extended up to the Police Commissioner himself, and the widespread police involvement in organised crime. Arantz took his allegations to senior police personnel, but they were dismissed out of hand. Eventually Arantz realised that Norman Thomas William Allan (who had been the state's Police Commissioner since 1962) was at least aware of the scheme, if not directly involved in it, and that he wanted to suppress Arantz's revelations. The frustrated Arantz created history when, through the journalist Basil Sweeney, he had official figures published in The Sydney Morning Herald showing that reported crime in 1971 was 75 per cent above the figures for 1970. So huge a difference could not be explained by a crime wave. An enraged Allan began a campaign to destroy Arantz's credibility. As a result, Arantz was suspended, forced to undergo a psychiatric assessment and, finally, dishonourably discharged from the police force. It took him years to clear his name. Meanwhile, both Commissioner Allan and New South Wales Premier Robert Askin had retired (respectively in 1972 and 1975), avoiding the taint from the scandal. It was not until 1989 that Arantz and his claims were finally and publicly vindicated, by which point Askin and Allan were long since dead. Four years earlier, the state government, led since 1976 by Neville Wran, had paid Arantz $250,000. The special legislation passed in 1989 allowed Arantz's notional reinstatement. With his victory behind him, Arantz retired to Dunedoo in the state's mid-west. In 1993, Arantz wrote a book about his experiences, entitled A Collusion of Powers. Five years later he died.",Normal

"Armahda is a Brazilian heavy metal band formed in 2011. They are known for dealing with themes related to the History of Brazil in their lyrics. With bands Aclla, Arandu Arakuaa, Cangaço, Hate Embrace, MorrigaM, Tamuya Thrash Tribe and Voodoopriest, they form the Levante do Metal Nativo (Native Metal Uprising), a movement gathering bands that mix heavy metal with typical musical elements from that country andor write lyrics about it. The group cites Blind Guardian, Sabaton, Black Sabbath, classical 1970s bands and German power metal bands as influences. The band was conceived by vocalist Maurício Guimarães and guitarist Renato Domingos, who met in the early 2000s. To write the lyrics, the group performs bibliographical researches to make sure the information is correct, including consulting the works at Biblioteca Nacional, Biblioteca do Exército and books by Laurentino Gomes. They also try not to make the lyrics too political in order not to be labelled as monarchists or admired by radical nationalists. The other three members were initially just session musicians. They released their first, self-titled, album in December 2013, with tracks about Maria I of Portugal, Guaraní War, Fernão Dias' expeditions and legends Matinta Perera and Iara. All tracks are sung in English except for ""Paiol em Chamas"", about explosions in weapons depots of the Brazilian Army in 1958, an event involving a military who was Guimarães' grandfather. The title track also contains part of its lyrics in Portuguese and talks about the Revolta da Armada, which names the quintet. In this song, voice actor Sílvio Navas, famous for his work in ThunderCats's Mumm-Ra, lend his voice to the parts spoken by marshall Floriano Peixoto. In 2014, they opened a show by Swedish band Sabaton, also notorious for its historical lyrics. Still in 2014, they said in an interview that they would like to talk about topics such as Zumbi dos Palmares and José de Anchieta in a future sophomore album, besides revisiting the War of Canudos, already covered in Armahda. They also intend to write more songs in Portuguese and with more Brazilian elements. In 2015, the band released a new single, ""The Last Farewell"", which lyrics deal with Dom Pedro II's final reigning days before the Proclamation of the Republic of Brazil. In order to write the lyrics, the band consulted material given by the Brazilian Imperial Family.",Normal

"The Nature of Sanctity: A Dialogue by the Catholic author Ida Friederike Coudenhove is a book about holiness and what it means to be a saint. It explores this topic through the lens of the life of St. Elizabeth of Hungary. Coudenhove is more well known today by her married name, Ida Friederike Görres. The Nature of Sanctity was first published in English in 1932 by Sheed and Ward. It was translated from the German by Ruth Bonsall and Edward Ingram Watkin. This book was originally published in German in 1931 as Gespräch um die heilige Elisabeth. Ein Dialog über die Heiligkeit. Catholic historian Christopher Dawson and T.F. Burns selected the short book The Nature of Sanctity to include as part of volume one, Essays on Religion and Culture, in the series The Persistence of Order. Essays on Religion and Culture was first published in 1932 by Sheed and Ward in London and then republished in 2019 by Cluny Media. The Nature of Sanctity, along with the book The Burden of Belief by Ida Coudenhove, inspired the book Dare to Live! Is Our Religion a Burden or a Boon? from 1941 by the American Carmelite priest Rev. Albert H. Dolan; Regarding his inspiration for Dare to Live!, Dolan describes The Nature of Sanctity and The Burden of Belief as ""magnificent volumes."" Dare to Live! was republished in 2015 by Aeterna Press. The Nature of Sanctity is written as a dialogue between two individuals identified as ""A"" and ""B."" In this work, Coudenhove uses the life of St. Elizabeth of Hungary as the central topic of a debate about the nature of holiness as it relates to human nature, good deeds, sacrifice, and love for God and humankind. “A” argues that St. Elizabeth's human nature and sanctity were in conflict, and only by overcoming her humanness did she become a saint. “B” argues that St. Elizabeth's sanctity could only be made possible through the perfection of her human nature.The dialogue then explores whether St. Elizabeth and her husband Ludwig's marriage and access to wealth enabled or inhibited her path to holiness. “A” and “B” argue whether sainthood is loving friendship with God, expressed through humility and sacrifice, and the nature of St. Elizabeth's banishment from Wartburg. Then, “B” argues that both Christians and non-Christians have a capacity for love of their neighbor, but that Christianity requires love of neighbor by all Christians. “A” responds that the gift of love of an individual hinders love of humankind. “A” and “B” then consider whether love of humanity, in the Christian sense, is actually love of God disguised as consideration for others. “A” concludes the dialogue by proposing that the saints’ living witness to Christ's life is the greatest gift the saints offer to Christians. The Nature of Sanctity is part one of a four-part series Görres wrote about key aspects of the Catholic faith and Catholic life. Part two is The Burden of Belief (published in German in 1932 and translated into English 1934). Part three is The Cloister and the World about discerning one's vocation in life (published in German in 1934 and translated into English 1935). Part Four about mercy, which has not yet been translated into English, is Des Andern Last. Ein Gespräch über die Barmherzigkeit (1940). The Nature of Sanctity was well received. In addition to being included in the series The Persistence of Order, as mentioned above, it received positive reviews. For example: In Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review, M.F.E. writes that, “Coudenhove's rapid but searching analysis of the ideas of sacrifice, of self-denial, and of human and divine love will help many to understand the problem more truly and to catch a glimpse of the solution.” In a review from 1934 in the Catholic magazine America, The Nature of Sanctity is described as “strong spiritual meat, and there is a deal of frank–at times, maybe a bit too frank–discussion; but this is needed badly if men and women of today are to be enticed at all to try to be saints.” Agnus Dun in Anglican Theological Review writes that The Nature of Sanctity’s “value lies in its interpretation of the dominant motives and inner tensions of the radically ascetic life.” Also, The Nature of Sanctity received mention in The Times Literary Supplement of London in 1933, which wrote a short synopsis of the book. The Nature of Sanctity was also translated from German into Dutch (1936), French (1936), and Hungarian (1936).",Normal

"The Eighth Promise: An American Son's Tribute to His Toisanese Mother is a memoir written by William Poy Lee published in 2007 by Rodale Books. The paperback version was released October 2007. A translation into Mandarin Chinese is in development with the Chinese Professors of American language and Culture Studies. The book interweaves a second generation Chinese American man's reflections on his upbringing in San Francisco in the 1960s and 70s with an oral history shared by his mother, Poy Jen, and her migration from Toisan, Guangdong. The author's personal memoir is set against the background of San Francisco of the 1960s and 1970s. Lee reflects on his childhood in working class Chinatown, Chinese American participation in the Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam War, and race relations through the era. The oral histories begin in the Southern Chinese farming villages of Toisan, where Poy Jen was born in 1926. The author shares interviews conducted in his family's original Toisanese dialect, translated into English. Poy Jen makes her mother eight promises before she leaves war-torn China to join her husband in America in 1950. Throughout the memoir, Lee traces the role of the promises in his own life and his mother's. The eighth promise serves as the thematic center of the book: ""It is the Eighth Promise -- to live with compassion toward all -- that I think of as the ever-living promise, the one for all of one's days. And this promise, this way -- perhaps arising to the level of a moral path -- strikes me as the distillation of all the wisdom of my kin."" The multiple levels of the narrative can be summarized as: Media outlets such as NPR, Fora TV and universities such as University of Kansas have invited the author for speaking engagements and interviews. Although the book primarily depicts the life of a Chinese American, many of the most avid and vocal readers are from other ethnicities such as Hispanics and Italian Americans. In late October 2007, the book won the 2007 PEN OaklandJosephine Miles Literary Award for outstanding and original contribution to multicultural literature. The city of Ann Arbor, Michigan selected the book for its 2008 One city one book program, Ann ArborYpsilanti Reads.",Normal
"Mueang Sing Buri (Thai: เมืองสิงห์บุรี, pronounced ) is the capital district (amphoe mueang) of Sing Buri province, central Thailand. Mueang Sing was a city before the establishment of the Sukhothai Kingdom. The old city was founded in Tambon Chaksi. King Ramathibodi I (Uthong) of Ayutthaya Kingdom set Mueang Sing, Mueang In, and Mueang Phrom as the inner cities under Lopburi, the northern frontier city of Ayutthaya. In the reign of King Trailokanat, government administration was reformed and the three cities were downgraded to be level four cities (เมืองจัตวา) because they were not far from the capital of the kingdom. When Ayutthaya was conquered by Burmese troops, Sing Buri was the city of warlord Phraya Tak (later King Taksin the Great). In 1895 King Rama V settled Monthon Thesaphiban, Sing Buri was placed in Monthon Krungkao. It became Mueang Sing Buri District in 1901, under the name Amphoe Bang Phutsa. In 1938 the government changed the name of the capital district to be the same as the name of the province. Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) In Buri of Singburi Province, Tha Wung of Lopburi province, Phrom Buri, Tha Chang, Khai Bang Rachan, and Bang Rachan of Sing Buri Province.

"Kipps is a 1921 British silent drama film directed by Harold M. Shaw and starring George K. Arthur, Edna Flugrath and Christine Rayner. It is an adaptation of the 1905 novel Kipps by H.G. Wells.

"Progress Alberta is a Canadian not for profit left-leaning advocacy organisation founded and operated by Duncan Kinney. Progress Alberta is based in Edmonton, Alberta and run by executive director Duncan Kinney. It is a political left of centre leaning advocacy organisation that was launched in 2016. Progress Alberta threatened legal action in 2020, when it claimed it was the target of Alberta Premier Jason Kenney and his United Conservative Party who launched a public inquiry into the funding of environmental advocacy in Alberta. The inquiry focussed on how United States-based philanthropic foundations partly funded environmental activism work in Alberta. Prior to the inquiry, Progress Alberta had received tens of thousands of dollars from Tides Foundation in 2016 and 2017. Duncan Kinney and lawyer Amir Attaran both argued that the inquiry was a breach of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

"Mihaly ""Michu"" Meszaros (Hungarian: Mészáros Mihály; 1 October 1939 – 12 June 2016) was a Hungarian actor, circus performerentertainer, and stuntman. As an American citizen, he was best remembered as a performer with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus and for his role in the NBC sitcom ALF. He was 2feet 9inches (0.84m) tall. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Meszaros was a television and film actor, and he also appeared opposite pop singer Michael Jackson in a Pepsi commercial. His last appearance was in 2015's Death to Cupid. For the first season of the ALF television series, Meszaros donned a costume whenever a full-body shot was needed for scenes of the alien walking, running, or standing. For the most part, however, upper-body shots of a mechanical puppet were used instead, since the full-body costume was extremely hot and uncomfortable for the actor to wear for long periods of time under bright studio lights. The ALF puppet and costume can be distinguished on first view because the head proportions are slightly different. Meszaros also was a member of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus as the former ""smallest man in the world"". As a youngster, he attended a state-run school of circus arts, becoming well versed in such performing skills as juggling, acrobatics and pantomime. For many years, American circus producers Irvin Feld and Kenneth Feld had heard of the existence, somewhere in Hungary, of a man almost too small to believe. The producers finally located him in 1973; astonished at his size and talents, they made immediate arrangements to bring Meszaros from the Hungarian circus to the United States. As a circus performer, he trained and presented white standard poodles for his act. Standing on their hind legs, the dogs appeared much taller than their diminutive but commanding trainer. Circus audiences nationwide cheered his dignified though slightly comedic role, in which he was billed as the ""Smallest Man in the World"". In the so-called Grand Spectacle performance of 1982 and 1983, Meszaros would portray a character known as the Marshal of Marshmallow Gulch, resplendent in a well-tailored white, silver and gold costume encrusted with rhinestones, along with matching cowboy hat and silver boots. In the 1980s Hawthorne, California, where he resided, named the shortest street in that city ""Michu Lane"" in his honor. On 12 June 2016, his manager Dennis Varga announced that Meszaros was in a comatose state in a Los Angeles hospital, after Varga discovered him unconscious on his bathroom floor. He had numerous health issues since a stroke eight years earlier. He died at the Providence Little Company of Mary medical center in Torrance the following night. In October 2018, his memorial service was held at Dearly Departed Tours & Artifact Museum, where his remains were inurned and on public display (along with items from his life and career) until the shop’s permanent closure in 2021. In 2023, a crowd funding drive was held through Spotfund website for “a grave for The Mighty Michu”. Scott Michaels was gathering funds to pay for Michu’s permanent internment within a new wall niche at Valhalla Cemetery in N. Hollywood.",Normal

"A Queen's Counsel (post-nominal QC), or King's Counsel (post-nominal KC) during the reign of a king, is an eminent lawyer (usually a barrister or advocate) who is appointed by the monarch to be one of ""Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the law."" The term is recognized as an honorific. Appointments are made from within the legal profession based on merit rather than a particular level of experience. Members have the privilege of sitting within the bar of court. As members wear silk gowns of a particular design (see court dress), appointment as Queen's Counsel is known informally as taking silk, and hence QCs are often colloquially called silks. The rank emerged in the sixteenth century but came to prominence over the course of the nineteenth. An appointment was open to barristers only until 1995. The first women KCs had been appointed only in 1949. In 1951, 16 people were appointed, all of them men. (1925) (1931) Source: The London Gazette, 3 April 1951 (no. 39190), p.1757.",Normal

"Renaldo and Clara is a 1978 American film directed by Bob Dylan and starring Bob Dylan, Sara Dylan and Joan Baez. Written by Dylan and Sam Shepard, the film incorporates three distinct film genres: concert footage, documentary interviews, and dramatic fictional vignettes reflective of Dylan's song lyrics and life. Filmed in the fall of 1975 prior to and during Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue tour, the film features appearances and performances by Phil Ochs, Ronee Blakley, T-Bone Burnett, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Allen Ginsberg, Arlo Guthrie, Ronnie Hawkins, Roger McGuinn, Joni Mitchell, Mick Ronson, Arlen Roth, Sam Shepard, and Harry Dean Stanton. Renaldo and Clara was released in its original four-hour form on January 25, 1978 in the United States. Its limited release in theaters in New York City, Los Angeles, and other cities was discontinued after a few weeks following widespread negative reviews. Renaldo and Clara was influenced by the French film Les Enfants du Paradis, and was written by Dylan. Most of the performers are musicians or members of Dylan's inner circle; the only professional actors in the cast are Sam Shepard, Harry Dean Stanton, Helena Kallianiotes, and Ronee Blakley. Many of the artists performing with the Rolling Thunder Revue are featured in the film, which also includes clips of concert performances and footage of Rubin Carter, the subject of Dylan's song ""Hurricane"". The film also features an appearance from the musician, David Blue, who gives some insight into the 1960s New York City folk music scene while playing a game of pinball. The machine was a Big Valley, built by Bally in 1970. The film also contains the last known footage of Phil Ochs, who is shown preparing to take the stage at Folk City in October 1975; he committed suicide six months later. Upon its theatrical release in 1978, Renaldo and Clara received poor reviews, and, after opening in New York City and Los Angeles, its initial limited theatrical run was discontinued after a few weeks. The film was also shown in a film theatre in Hampstead, London, in a film theatre in Rialto, Dublin and in the Tyneside Cinema in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in May 1979. Later in 1978, Dylan allowed a two-hour edit of the film to be distributed. The shortened version focused more on the concert footage and omitted many of the dramatic scenes. After a small number of showings of the original version on European television, Dylan withdrew the film from distribution. It was shown in two parts 7–8 July 1980 on German television ZDF; on Finnish television 28 August 1982; 26 December 1983 (Boxing Day) on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. The 4-hour version was also shown 29 May 2011 at the Glasgow Film Theatre. Copies, made from recordings of the television broadcast, circulate among collectors. The only parts of the project to be released widely since its withdrawal are the excerpts found on the bonus DVD accompanying the initial release of Dylan's The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue and in footage that was repurposed for the 2019 pseudo-documentary Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese. Footage from the film also appeared in the music video of Dylan's 1991 song ""Series of Dreams"". As of 2021, the film has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 38% based on eight critic reviews, with an average rating of 4.510.",Normal
"The de Marçay 2 C1 was a prototype single-seat biplane fighter designed in France and first flown in 1919. It did not go into production. The de Marçay 2 was designed at the end of World War I and flew early in 1919. It was a single-bay sesquiplane with low-aspect ratio, rectangular-plan wings mounted with stagger. On each side a parallel pair of forward-leaning interplane struts defined the bays, with another, outward-leaning pair rooted at their base to brace the overhang of the upper wing. The centre of the latter was attached to the upper fuselage by short cabane struts. Only the upper wings carried ailerons; these narrowed in chord outward before rapidly widening at their tips to form horn balances. The fighter's fuselage was flat sided, though with rounded upper and lower decking. The original intention was fit a Liberty L-8 V-8 engine but problems with this model led to the installation of a 220kW (300hp) Hispano-Suiza 8Fb, also a V-8. A pair of fixed, synchronized 0.303in (7.7mm) Vickers machine guns fired through the propeller disc. The pilot's open cockpit placed him at the trailing edge of the upper wing, which had a deep cut-out to improve his upward field of view; the lower wings had smaller cut-outs for downward vision. The empennage of the de Marçay was conventional, with a triangular tailplane and semi-elliptical elevator mounted on top of the fuselage. The broad chord fin was also triangular, with a rounded rudder which went down to the keel, operating between the elevators. It had a fixed, tailskid undercarriage with its mainwheels on a single axle which was rubber sprung to a transverse cross brace between two pairs of V-struts from the lower fuselage. Piloted by Lebeau, the de Marçay 2 took part in the C1 or single seat fighter category of the 1919 Service Aéronautique competition held at Villacoublay. Though it was the fastest aircraft there, the Nieuport 29 was awarded a production contract and no more de Marçay 2s were built. The lone prototype was advertised for sale by SAECA Edmund de Marçay through most of 1920, though its ultimate fate is not recorded.

"Jeff Decker is a sculptor and historian who is known for his bronze sculptures, the most notable of which is titled ""By the Horns"" (also known as The Hill Climber), a 16-foot-tall, 5,000-pound bronze located on the grounds of the Harley-Davidson Museum. His bronze-cast sculptures depicting the synergy of man and modern machines, particularly historic motorcycles, is known in both the motorcycling community and the world of fine art. As of 2009, Decker was Harley-Davidson's official sculptor. Decker is the son of Allen and Lana Decker. Steeped in the southern California car culture of the 1960s, Decker learned the ways of his father. An intense collector, Decker's father owned one of the area's largest flathead speed equipment collections. Working full-time at a bronze casting foundry, Decker's first idea was to capture Man's quest for speed in all vehicles. His first sculpture was a 1924 Miller Indy car. Next came the Baby Bootlegger, a 1922 world record-holding speedboat. On display at Bob Dron Harley-Davidson located in Oakland, California, Decker created a life-size bronze statue from a famous photograph of Joe Petrali showing him astride a Harley Streamliner, taken during Petrali's historic 136mile per hour record setting run at Daytona on March 13, 1937. and is the only bronze sculpture artist licensed by Harley-Davidson to replicate their products.

"The Diocese of Boise (Latin: Diœcesis Xylopolitana) is a Latin Church ecclesiastical territory, or diocese, of the Catholic Church in Idaho in the United States. The Diocese of Boise is led by Bishop Peter F. Christensen, whose seat is the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Boise. The diocese is a suffragan diocese in the ecclesiastical province of the metropolitan Archdiocese of Portland. The first Catholics to arrive in present day Boise were French-Canadian fur trappers in the mid 1700's. After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, when the area became part of the United States, it fell under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Baltimore in Maryland. In 1815, 19 Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) migrated into Idaho from eastern Canada. Having had contact with Catholic missionaries in Canada, the Iroquois spoke to the Native American tribes about heaven and how they needed the ""black robes"" to show them how to get there. Over the next 25 years, the Nez Perce and Flathead tribes sent four delegations to St. Louis, Missouri to speak with Catholic officials, attempting to recruit a priest for their communities. In 1840, the Diocese of St. Louis sent Pierre-Jean De Smet, a Jesuit priest, to minister to the tribes. De Smet celebrated the mass in Idaho in July 1840 at Henry's Lake. Nicholas Point in 1843 constructed the Cataldo Mission along the St. Joe River near present-day St. Maries. It was the first mission church in Idaho. The Cataldo Mission later moved to its present location on the Coeur d'Alene River. It is the oldest building in Idaho. With the establishment by the Vatican in 1846 of the Vicariate Apostolic of Oregon Territory, all of the Idaho area was under this jurisdiction. For the next 19 years, most of the Catholics in Idaho belonged to the Native American tribes. With the discovery of gold in the Boise Basin in 1862, tens of thousands of miners flooded the area, including large numbers of Irish Catholics. Due to the area's growth, President Abraham Lincoln created the Territory of Idaho in 1863. That same year, the first church for the European Catholics, St. Joseph's, was built in the booming mining town of Idaho City. Pope Pius IX in 1868 erected the Vicariate Apostolic of Idaho and Montana, covering a vast area west of the Northern Rockies. At that time, both the territory and the apostolic vicariate included the current state of Idaho and the western portions of Montana and Wyoming. The pope named Louis Lootens of the Archdiocese of San Francisco as the first vicar apostolic. When the vicariate was established, the population of Idaho was approximately 20,000 , of whom only 1,500 were Catholic. By the 1870s, the Idaho gold rush had ended, miners were leaving the territory and its towns were drying up. When Lootens' health began to fail, the Vatican allowed him to resign from the vicariate in 1876. The vicariate would be without a bishop for the next eight years. In 1887, Pope Leo XIII appointed Alphonse Glorieux as the second vicar apostolic of Idaho and Montana. Glorieux designated Boise as his see city. On August 23, 1893, Leo XIII erected the Diocese of Boise, covering the entire state of Idaho. He appointed Glorieux as its first bishop. At that time, there were approximately 7,000 registered Catholics in the state. In 1894, the Sisters of the Holy Cross opened St. Alphonsus Hospital, the first hospital in Boise. In 1906, Gladieux laid the cornerstone for the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Boise. The opening of large tracts of land to settlement and the arrival of the railroad greatly increased the population of Idaho. The diocese grew dramatically over the following century. One group of significance are the Basque people, who began immigrating to Idaho early in the twentieth century and primarily worked within the sheep industry. (Approximately 15,000 of their descendants remain in the diocese today.) Glorieux died in 1917. Succeeding Glorieux as bishop in 1918 was Daniel Gorman from the Archdiocese of Dubuque, selected by Pope Benedict XV. Gorman oversaw large growth within the diocese during his nine years as bishop, adding 32 diocesan priests, completing construction on the cathedral, and doubling enrollment in parish schools. After Gorman died in 1927, Pope Pius XI named Edward Kelly from the Diocese of Baker City as his replacement. Kelly served for 28 years until his death in 1956. The next bishop of Boise was Auxiliary Bishop James J. Byrne from the Archdiocese of St. Paul, selected by Pius XII in 1956. Beginning in the middle of the twentieth century, large numbers of migrant workers from Mexico arrived in the diocese. Some settled permanently in the region, while many others remained migratory and would return to Mexico after the harvest. Toward the latter part of the century, the number of immigrants from Mexico and other parts of Latin America increased dramatically, with the vast majority of them settling permanently in the southern part of the diocese. So many immigrants have now made Idaho their home that people of Latin American heritage now constitute well over half of the Catholics within the diocese. Byrne became archbishop of Dubuque in 1962. The fifth bishop of Boise, Sylvester W. Treinen from the Diocese of Bismarck, was chosen in 1962 by Pope John XXIII. As bishop, he is remembered for implementing the reforms of the Second Vatican Council. He retired in 1988. Pope John Paul II then named Tod Brown from the Diocese of Monterey-Fresno as the sixth bishop of Boise in 1989. He became bishop of the Diocese of Orange in 1998. In 1999, Auxiliary Bishop Michael P. Driscoll of Orange was appointed bishop in Boise by John Paul II. After Driscoll retired In 2014, Pope Francis appointed Bishop Peter F. Christensen of the Diocese of Superior as the eighth bishop of Boise. In April 2020, Christensen issued a memo containing orders for diocese priests, including an order banning them from celebrating mass ad orientem (facing the altar). As of 2023, Christensen is the current bishop of Boise. Approximately 150,000 Catholics live within the Diocese of Boise, making them approximately 11% of the population of the state of Idaho. The diocese is divided up into six deaneries containing 51 parishes, 31 stations, and 25 chapels. The diocese operates five hospitals: In 1985, Mel Baltazar was sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted of lewd conduct with a 15 year old boy. Baltazar met the victim when he was serving as a chaplain at St. Alphonsus Medical Center. The presiding judge stated that the Catholic Church protected Baltazar while he abused children in previous positions with other dioceses. In 2003, a San Diego man sued the Diocese of Boise and several other dioceses, claiming that Baltazar sexually abused him in California and other locations for five years during the 1970s. Deacon Robert Howell was arrested in November 2004 on charges of possessing child pornography. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced in March 2005 to 18 months in prison. Some of Howell's former parishioners were angry with the diocese for waiting until March to inform them about Howell. In September 2018, W. Thomas Faucher pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography, distribution of child pornography, and possession of marijuana. Chatroom conversations obtained by law enforcement revealed Faucher's intent to use marijuana to drug children and operate a child pornography ring that also involved the rapes of these children. Faucher had satanic interests and admitted to acts of blasphemy and desecration. That same year, two individuals reported to the diocese that they had been sexually abused as minors by Faucher. In December 2018, Faucher was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The diocese evicted Faucher from his house while he was in jail, and performed an exorcism on the property before putting it up for sale. In 2020, Faucher died in prison. The diocese in October 2019 released a list of 15 priests and one deacon with credible accusations of sexual abuse of children.

"Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a 2011 Japanese-language American documentary film directed by David Gelb. The film follows Jiro Ono (小野 二郎, Ono Jirō), a then-85-year-old sushi master and owner of Sukiyabashi Jiro, previously a Michelin three-star restaurant. Sukiyabashi Jiro is a 10-seat, sushi-only restaurant located in a Tokyo subway station. As of 2023, Jiro Ono serves a tasting menu of roughly 20 courses, for a minimum of JP¥55,000 (US$270). The film also profiles Jiro's two sons, both of whom are also sushi chefs. The younger son, Takashi (隆士), left Sukiyabashi Jiro to open a mirror image of his father's restaurant in Roppongi Hills. The 50-year-old elder son, Yoshikazu (禎一), obliged to succeed his father, still works for Jiro and is faced with the prospect of one day taking over the flagship restaurant. Initially, Gelb had planned to do what he had nicknamed ""Planet Sushi"", inspired by the cinematography of the BBC documentary Planet Earth: Originally, I was going to make a film with a lot of different sushi chefs who all had different styles, but when I got to Jiro's restaurant, I was not only amazed by how good the sushi was and how much greater it was than any other sushi restaurant I had ever been to, but I also found Jiro to be such a compelling character and such an interesting person. I was also fascinated by the story of his son, who is fifty years old, but still works for his father at the restaurant. So, I thought, ""Here's a story about a person living in his father's shadow while his father is in a relentless pursuit of perfection."" It was the makings of a good feature film. Food critic Masuhiro Yamamoto connected Gelb with Jiro. Principal photography took Gelb one month (January 2010), augmented by additional scenes shot later that year in August; editing took 10 months. Jiro Dreams of Sushi debuted in the US in 2011 at the Tribeca Film Festival and was an official selection of the Provincetown International Film Festival in the same year. The documentary was made available on Netflix streaming on August 28, 2012. As of 2013, the film has grossed US$2,552,478 in North America. It is ranked 70th of all US Documentaries on Box Office Mojo. The film received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. The film earned a rating of 99% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 88 reviews and an average rating of 7.810. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Beautiful, thoughtful, and engrossing, Jiro Dreams of Sushi should prove satisfying even for filmgoers who don't care for the cuisine."" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 77 out of 100, based on 27 reviews, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Roger Ebert called it a ""portrait of tunnel vision"" and concluded: While watching it, I found myself drawn into the mystery of this man. Are there any unrealized wishes in his life? Secret diversions? Regrets? If you find an occupation you love and spend your entire life working at it, is that enough? Standing behind his counter, Jiro notices things. Some customers are left-handed, some right-handed. That helps determine where they are seated at his counter. As he serves a perfect piece of sushi, he observes it being eaten. He knows the history of that piece of seafood. He knows his staff has recently started massaging an octopus for 45 minutes and not half an hour, for example. Does he search a customer's eyes for a signal that this change has been an improvement? Half an hour of massage was good enough to win three Michelin stars. Gelb, a ""huge Philip Glass fan"", has commented on his use of Philip Glass compositions in the film's soundtrack: In hindsight, I think it works because Philip Glass's music is kind of a metaphor for Jiro's work ethic, because it's repetitive but it also builds on itself and escalates, and it's the same with Jiro's work. Because every day he's going, he's doing the same routine, and trying to do everything exactly the same, but just reaching for that one step of improvement, and I feel like the music's doing the same thing, so they match perfectly. The soundtrack includes the following:",Normal

"""Face Dances, Pt. 2"" is single written and composed by Pete Townshend, most famously known as the guitarist for the Who. The song appears on Townshend's 1982 solo album All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes. Pete Townshend said that the song, in addition to the other songs on All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes, was about his personal experiences of alienation from both his wife and band members from the Who that he experienced during the early 1980s.  the anthem of the soul in solitary confinement. It's a feeling like  feeling in jail. The face that I sing about is my own. I wrote the lyrics while I was looking in a mirror! Although it shares a title with it, ""Face Dances Pt. 2"" was not released on Townshend's band The Who's album Face Dances. In the liner notes for Face Dances, it is claimed that the song was written after the release of the Who album, but authors Steve Grantley and Alan Parker claim in their book, The Who By Numbers: The Story Of The Who Through Their Music, that the song was cut from the album. Billboard suggested that the ""eccentric time shifts and circular melodic scheme"" would reduce its appeal to pop music radio stations. A companion video for All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes was also released, featuring ""Face Dances, Pt. 2"" as one of the concept videos. In some parts of the video, the covers for both the album and ""Face Dances, Pt. 2"" single sleeves are mimicked while Townshend lip-syncs to the song.

"In enzymology, a 1-phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (EC 2.7.1.67) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol, whereas its two products are ADP and 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4-phosphate. This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include phosphatidylinositol kinase (phosphorylating), phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, phosphatidylinositol kinase, type II phosphatidylinositol kinase, PI kinase, and PI 4-kinase.

"The Saint-Sulpice Seminary (French:Vieux Séminaire de Saint-Sulpice) is a building in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is the second oldest structure in Montreal and was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 1980. It is located in the Ville-Marie Borough in the Old Montreal district, next to Notre-Dame Basilica on Notre-Dame Street, facing Place d'Armes. The seminary is a classic U-shaped building featuring a palatial style and includes an annex. Saint-Sulpice Seminary was founded in 1657 by the Society of Priests of Saint Sulpice, who have been the sole owner of the building since its creation. Construction began in 1684 by François Dollier de Casson, superior of the Sulpicians, and was completed in 1687, although later additions, such as the clock, were completed by 1713. It was dedicated to the education of secular priests and to mission work among native peoples in New France. The façade of the building is adorned with a clock, constructed and installed in 1701, near the top. The clock’s dial was created in Paris, engraved by Paul Labrosse and gilded by the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre-Dame. The clock is one of the oldest of its kind in North America. Following a monastic tradition, the Sulpicians built a garden in the 17th century near their seminary to grow fruits and vegetables. The garden borrowed the French tradition from the Renaissance of the geometrical arrangement of the aisles with the lawn and central statue. The gardens are one of the oldest gardens of its kind in North America. 45°30′14″N 73°33′25″W﻿ ﻿45.50389°N 73.55694°W﻿ 45.50389; -73.55694 Hustak, Alan. “.” The Gazette (Index-Only). 1998.

"Social Statics, or The Conditions essential to Happiness specified, and the First of them Developed is an 1851 book by the British polymath Herbert Spencer. The book was published by John Chapman of London. In the book, he uses the term ""fitness"" in applying his ideas of Lamarckian evolution to society, saying for example that ""It is clear that any being whose constitution is to be moulded into fitness for new conditions of existence must be placed under those conditions. Or, putting the proposition specifically—it is clear that man can become adapted to the social state, only by being retained in the social state. This granted, it follows that as man has been, and is still, deficient in those feelings which, by dictating just conduct, prevent the perpetual antagonism of individuals and their consequent disunion, some artificial agency is required by which their union may be maintained. Only by the process of adaptation itself can be produced that character which makes social equilibrium spontaneous."" Despite its commonly being attributed to this book, it was not until his Principles of Biology of 1864 that Spencer coined the phrase ""survival of the fittest"", which he would later apply to economics and biology. This could be described as a key tenet of so-called Social Darwinism, though Spencer and his book were not an advocate thereof. Economist Murray Rothbard called Social Statics ""the greatest single work of libertarian political philosophy ever written."" In Lochner v. New York, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., dissenting from the Supreme Court's holding that state legislation forbidding bakers from working more than ten hours a day or sixty hours a week violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by infringing on the individual's liberty of contract, famously wrote: ""The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statics.""",Normal

Chain-Gang All-Stars was shortlisted for the 2023 National Book Award for Fiction and The New York Times named it one of the ten best books of 2023. Adjei-Brenyah was born in the Bronx, New York but grew up in Spring Valley, New York. Both of his parents are from Ghana. His father was a defense attorney and his mother was a kindergarten teacher. Adjei-Brenyah started writing from a young age and wrote for his high school's literature magazine. Adjei-Brenyah went to University at Albany, SUNY for his undergraduate degree, where he learned from Lynne Tillman. He later attended the graduate writing program at Syracuse University with the goal to study with George Saunders in the creative writing program. Saunders later became his thesis adviser and mentor. Adjei-Brenyah later went on to teach in the same program. After college, Adjei-Brenyah became interested in prison abolition and worked at the Rockland Coalition to End the New Jim Crow. Adjei-Brenyah's published works are set in near-future dystopias. They often explore the topics of exploitation, capitalism, and the societal acceptance of violence. Adjei-Brenyah's debut book is a collection of 12 satirical short stories exploring many topics, including racism in modern-day America, consumerism, school shootings, and generational violence. Vulture described the book as ""an irreverent, genre-bending approach to ripped-from-the-headlines subject matter"". Adjei-Brenyah's first novel is set in a dystopian America where imprisoned people have the choice to leave prison by joining a gladiatorial system called the ""CAPE"" or Criminal Action Penal Entertainment program where they take part in televised duels to the death as part of alliances called Chain Gangs. If they manage to survive three years of battles, then they are freed. The book has a large cast and is written from the perspective of multiple people participating in the program, as well as activists fighting against it, fans, and the people running it. The book is a fictional novel but features many footnotes citing current laws and factual statistics about the incarceration system in the United States. Chain-Gang All-Stars started as a short story for inclusion in Friday Black but became too long. Adjei-Brenyah has said that he developed it into a novel because he felt he needed to spend more time exploring the main character, Loretta Thurwar. Chain-Gang All-Stars was shortlisted for the 2023 National Book Award for Fiction. Kirkus Reviews named it one of the best books of 2023.

"Benno Jacob (7 September 1862 – 24 January 1945) was a liberal rabbi and Bible scholar. Jacob studied in the Rabbinical Seminary and University of his native Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland). He served as a rabbi between the years 1891-1929 until he retired to Hamburg to concentrate on his exegetical work. Already in his student years he was active in the fight against antisemitism, he founded a Jewish student's society that introduced fencing duels as a method of defending the honor of Judaism when it was degraded by antisemitic students. In 1892 he had a confrontation with Liebermann von Sonnenberg, a prominent antisemitic politician and publisher. After Sonnenberg delivered a two and a half hour lecture on the Talmud, Jacob, bearing a copy of the Talmud, challenged him to read out the passages he had referred to in his lecture. When Sonnenberg admitted that he could not read even a letter of the Hebrew language, Jacob chided him for speaking about a book which he could not even read and delivered an impromptu lecture of his own refuting the arguments previously advanced. After this pattern was repeated a few more times Liebermann von Sonnenberg was forced to cancel his tour. Jacob was also an active author and orator in the fight against German antisemitism in the years following World War I. He opposed Zionism not only because of his belief in a Jewish-German synthesis, but also because he saw in Zionism a complete secularization of Judaism and a basis for Jewish atheism. Benno Jacob was a scholarly liberal rabbi (with a University degree in Semitics) in Germany until World War II. Before leaving Germany, he produced a monumental commentary on Genesis. Recently, a German edition of his commentary on Exodus has been published. Generally, Jacob is linked with Umberto Cassuto as one of the great twentieth-century opponents of the Documentary Hypothesis. Jacob was not a fundamentalist and did not believe in Mosaic authorship. His rejection of the Documentary Hypothesis was based on his sense that the Pentateuch presents so much literary unity and spiritual harmony that a search for its ""sources"" could only be an exercise in futile hypothesis. Melding a traditionalist (if not traditional) view of the Torah with a knowledge of Semitics and applying a Germanic thoroughness to his conviction that no word in the Torah is out of place, he produced two commentaries which attempt to explain nearly every nuance of every word in the Torah. The programmatic statement in his 1916 book, Quellenscheiden und Exegese im Pentateuch, illustrates his concerns:  means of representation may be termed the semi-poetic or dichotomistic. It proceeds like poetry, but without its strict measure , employing instead paired thoughts, patterns of words and clauses and syntax, in doublets, parallels and contrasts; it is rooted, when all is said and done, in the Semitic , which grasps matters dichotomously. This manner of seeing, conceiving and representing dominates the Hebrew language and literature in its entirety, to its subtlest manifestations.",Normal
"The Trucial States (Arabic: الإمارات المتصالحة Al-Imārāt al-Mutaṣāliḥa), also known as the Trucial Coast (Arabic: الساحل المتصالح Al-Sāḥil al-Mutaṣāliḥ), the Trucial Sheikhdoms (Arabic: المشيخة المتصالحة Al-Mashīkhat al-Mutaṣāliḥa), Trucial Arabia or Trucial Oman, was the name the British government gave to a group of tribal confederations to the south of the Persian Gulf (southeastern Arabia) whose leaders had signed protective treaties, or truces, with the United Kingdom between 1820 and 1892. The Trucial States remained an informal British protectorate until the treaties were revoked on 1 December 1971. The following day, six of the sheikhdoms—Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain and Fujairah—formed the United Arab Emirates; the seventh, Ras Al Khaimah, joined on February 10, 1972. The sheikhdoms included: The sheikhdoms permanently allied themselves with the United Kingdom through a series of treaties, beginning with the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 and including the Perpetual Maritime Truce of 1853, until in 1892 they entered into ""Exclusivity Agreements"" with the British—following on from Bahrain in 1880—which put them under British protection. This was an unclear status which fell short of a formal protectorate, but required Britain to defend them from external aggression in exchange for exclusive British rights in the states. Two sheikhdoms at various times looked as if they might be granted trucial status, affirming their independence from neighbouring Sharjah, Al Hamriyah and Al Heera, but neither signed treaties with the British. Kalba, granted trucial status in 1936 because it was chosen as the site of a back-up landing strip for the Imperial Airways flights into Sharjah, was re-incorporated into Sharjah in 1951 on the death of its ruler. The last sheikhdom to be granted recognition was that of Fujairah, which became a trucial state in 1952 after the British Government came under pressure from PCL (Petroleum Concessions Limited) to grant status in order that the company could have a free hand to explore for oil along the whole east coast. In 1952, the Trucial States Council was established to encourage co-operation among the seven rulers. The Indian rupee remained the de facto currency of the Trucial States as well as the other Persian Gulf states such as Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman until the Gulf rupee was introduced in 1959. The Gulf rupee was used until the Gulf countries introduced their own currencies after the great devaluation of the rupee. The southeastern Persian Gulf coast was called the ""Pirate Coast"" by the British, who argued that raiders based there—particularly the 'Qawasim' or 'Joasmees', now known as the Al Qasimi (the ruling families of Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah)—harassed British-flagged shipping. The first in a long series of maritime skirmishes between the Al Qasimi and British vessels took place in 1797, when the British-flagged snow Bassein was seized and released two days later. The cruiser Viper was subsequently attacked off Bushire. The Al Qasimi leader, Saqr bin Rashid Al Qasimi, protested innocence in both cases. A period of great instability followed along the coast, with a number of actions between British and Al Qasimi vessels alongside various changes of leadership and allegiances between the rulers of Ras Al Khaimah, Ajman and Sharjah with Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi claiming sovereignty over 'all the Joasmee ports' in 1823, a claim recognised by the British at the time. British expeditions to protect British Indian trade and interests around Ras al-Khaimah, close to the Strait of Hormuz, led to campaigns against that headquarters and other harbours along the coast in 1809, and again (with far greater destructive force) in 1819. The next year, 1820, a peace treaty was signed to which all the sheikhs of the coast adhered. The signatories to that treaty included Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi of Sharjah (on 6 January 1820). He signed a 'preliminary agreement' also on behalf of Ajman and Umm Al Qawain, and then on 8 January at Ras Al Khaimah, Hassan Bin Rahma Al Qasimi signed as ""Sheikh of 'Hatt and Falna' formerly of Ras Al Khaimah"" ('Hatt' being the modern day village of Khatt and 'Falna' being the modern day suburb of Ras Al Khaimah, Fahlain, near the location of Al Falayah Fort), followed on 10 January 1820 by Qadib bin Ahmad of Jazirah Al Hamrah (given in the treaty's English translation as 'Jourat Al Kamra') signed. On 11 January 1820, again at Ras Al Khaimah, Shakhbut bin Diyab Al Nahyan signed on behalf of his son, Tahnoon, the Sheikh of the Bani Yas and ruler of Abu Dhabi. Husain bin Ali of Rams signed on 15 January 1820. The uncle of Muhammad bin Hazza of Dubai signed on 28 January 1820 in Sharjah. The Rulers of Ajman and Umm Al Quwain acceded to the full treaty on 15 March 1820, signing on board the ship of the commander of the British expeditionary force, Major-General William Keir Grant. The treaty was also signed, at Sharjah, by the emir of Bahrain. The Sheikh of Rams lost the support of his people soon after and both he and the Sheikh of Jazirah Al Hamrah were deposed and their communities became subject to the rule of Ras Al Khaimah. However, the Al-Zaabi family continued to rule Jazirah Al Hamrah as vassals until 1970. As a peace treaty, it was not a conspicuous success. Skirmishes and conflicts, considered as raids by the British, continued intermittently until 1835, when the sheikhs agreed not to engage in hostilities at sea and Sharjah, Dubai, Ajman and Abu Dhabi signed a renewed treaty banning hostilities during the pearling season and a number of other short treaties were made, culminating with the ten-year truce of June 1843. Feeling the benefit of peaceful pearling and trade, the coastal Sheikhs signed the Perpetual Treaty of Maritime Peace in 1853, a process overseen by the British political agent at Bushire, Captain AB Kemball. Separate treaties in 1847 and 1856 saw treaties undertaking the abolition of slave trading and, in 1873, a further treaty abolishing slaving was signed by Sharjah and Abu Dhabi. Primarily in reaction to the ambitions of France and Russia, Britain and the Trucial Sheikhdoms established closer bonds in an 1892 treaty, similar to treaties entered into by the UK with other Persian Gulf principalities. The sheikhs agreed not to dispose of any territory except to Britain and not to enter into relationships with any other foreign government without Britain's consent. In return, the British promised to protect the Trucial Coast from all aggression by sea and to help in case of land attack. This treaty, the ""Exclusive Agreement"", was signed by the Rulers of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Ras Al Khaimah and Umm Al Quwain between 6 and 8 March 1892. It was subsequently ratified by the Viceroy of India and the British Government in London. In the 1920s, the British Government's desire to create an alternative air route from Great Britain to India gave rise to discussions with the rulers of the Trucial States about landing areas, anchorages and fuel depots along the coast. The first aeroplanes to appear were Royal Air Force (RAF) flying boats, used by RAF personnel to survey the area, and by political officers to visit the rulers. Air agreements were initially resisted by the rulers, who suspected interference with their sovereignty, however they also provided a useful source of revenue. In 1932, the demise of the air route through Persia (today's Iran) led to the opening of an airfield at Sharjah. In 1937, Imperial Airways flying boats began to call in at Dubai, and continued to do so for the next ten years. The Trucial States Council was a forum for the leaders of the emirates to meet, presided over by the British Political Agent. The first meetings took place in 1952, one in spring and one in autumn, and this set a pattern for meetings in future years. The council was purely consultative and had no written constitution and no policy making powers, it provided more than anything a forum for the Rulers to exchange views and agree on common approaches. The British managed to provoke considerable irritation amongst the Rulers, especially Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah, when the Ruler of Fujairah, recognised as a Trucial State by Britain on 21 March 1952, attended his first Trucial States Council. By 1958, committees were set up to advise on public health, agriculture and education, but the council had no funding until 1965, when the chairmanship moved from the Political Agent to one of the Rulers, the first chairman being Shaikh Saqr bin Mohammed Al Qasimi of Ras Al Khaimah. One issue which came up regularly in the council's first 14 meetings was that of locusts—the swarms were highly destructive to the agricultural areas of the whole area—but the Bedouin of the interior were convinced the spraying of insecticide would be detrimental to their herds and resisted the teams brought in from Pakistan to spray the insects' breeding grounds. At this time, the Council was given a grant by the British to administer as it saw fit, instead of merely advising on British-prepared budgets. A full-time secretariat was also recruited. Harold Wilson's announcement, on 16 January 1968, that all British troops were to be withdrawn from ""east of Suez"", signalled the end of Britain taking care of foreign policy and defence, as well as arbitrating between the rulers of the Eastern Persian Gulf. The decision pitched the rulers of the Trucial Coast, together with Qatar and Bahrain, into fevered negotiations to fill the political vacuum that the British withdrawal would leave behind. The principle of union was first agreed between the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, and Sheikh Rashid of Dubai on 18 February 1968 meeting in an encampment at Argoub Al Sedirah, near Al Semeih, a desert stop between the two emirates. The two agreed to work towards bringing the other emirates, including Qatar and Bahrain, into the union. Over the next two years, negotiations and meetings of the rulers followed—often stormy—as a form of union was thrashed out. The nine-state union was never to recover from the October 1969 meeting where British intervention resulted in a walk-out by Qatar and Ras Al Khaimah. Bahrain and Qatar were to drop out of talks, leaving only six emirates to agree on union on 18 July 1971. On 2 December 1971, Dubai, together with Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain and Fujairah joined in the Act of Union to form the United Arab Emirates. The seventh emirate, Ras Al Khaimah, officially joined the UAE on 10 February 1972. This change was due to the Iranian seizure of the islands Greater and Lesser Tunbs from Ras Al Khaimah and Abu Musa which was claimed by the emirate of Sharjah. The Iranian occupation of the three islands occurred on 30 November 1971 following the British withdrawal. Culture:Anglosphere",Normal

"William Holmes Howland (11 June 1844 – 12 December 1893) was Mayor of Toronto from 1886 to 1887. He was also a member of the Orange Order in Canada. Prior to William Holmes Howland becoming Toronto's 25th mayor, he was a businessman who was elected president of the Board of Trade in 1874-1875. He was involved in many causes like the Toronto General Hospital, the Toronto Bible Training School, the Christian Missionary Union, the Mimico Industrial School for Boys and he was interested in improving the living conditions of the slum areas of the city. He turned to municipal politics to try to help the city with problems like drunkenness, slum conditions, filthy streets and to clean up the foul water supply. In 1884 the Ontario legislature changed voting laws to allow women to vote. Unmarried women and widows of voting age that owned or rented property assessed at over $400 were allowed to vote. Mayoralty races started to go after this group of people in future elections. Howland campaigned for morality, religion and reform with the support of the Municipal Reform Association and was elected by a margin of 1900 votes. His campaign coined the motto ""Toronto the Good"" for the city. During Howland's first term he had much controversy. He was removed as mayor after personal finance problems made him transfer his assets to his wife. After that he didn't have the property qualifications to be mayor. Another election was called and he went back to the nomination meeting after he had transferred his assets back to himself. There were no other candidates so he was again confirmed as mayor. Many problems arose when he came back as Mayor. Senior officials were arrested for misuse of funds after a coal-supply scandal broke out and a street railway strike that was backed by Howland had the militia brought in after three days of rioting. His attempt to restrict liquor licences was also defeated by council. One of Howland's achievements was the appointment of an Inspector to the police department to fight vice and prostitution. During his second term, council's time was occupied with projects like the Don Improvement Scheme, construction of a new city hall and court house (to replace both old city hall and Adelaide Street Court House), waterworks improvements and street paving. He was finally able to have the number of liquor licences issued by council reduced from 223 to 150 after the passing of the ""Fleming Bylaw"". He didn't seek re-election and left politics. He spent the rest of his life trying to sort out his personal business affairs that suffered during his mayoralty. He died at the age of 49 from an acute case of pneumonia. Howland's father was Sir William Pearce Howland, the only American born Father of Confederation, while brother Oliver Aiken Howland was Toronto Mayor from 1901 to 1902.",Normal

"Copley is a village of roughly 400 inhabitants in County Durham, England. It is situated 9 miles west of Bishop Auckland, and 6 miles from Barnard Castle. It has a rural setting close to the North Pennines area. The lower part of the village by the River Gaunless still retains the original chimney and some of the buildings from the old Gaunless Valley Lead Mill. Copley has its own weather station run by the Met Office and Environment Agency. Because of its elevation above sea-level, around the 1,000ft contour, and position in the north-east, this station is often one of the coldest in England with high incidences of ground frosts and snowfalls. Copley is in a relatively dry and sunny rain-shadow area in the shelter of the higher Pennines to the west. The same higher Pennines can create a local gusty effect if the wind blows from the west-south-west. This is called the Pennine Lee Wave and can appear suddenly and disappear just as quickly. Copley Village has the distinction of the snowiest Met.Office site in England and the 5th snowiest in the UK. The North Pennines are one of the snowiest parts of England and Copley Village sees snow falling on average 53 days each year. It is just east of the North Pennines AONB, home to one of only a handful of outdoor ski centres in England. Copley has a Village Hall which is part of the Teesdale Village Halls' Consortium.

"Paete, officially the Municipality of Paete (Tagalog: Bayan ng Paete), is a 4th class municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 24,945 people. The town is located at the north-eastern part of Laguna. From Manila, Paete can be reaches passing through Rizal Province via Manila East Road or Via South Luzon Expressway. Along the shores of picturesque Laguna de Bay. It was founded in 1580 by Spanish friars Juan de Plasencia and Diego de Oropesa of the Franciscan Order. It is believed that the earliest inhabitants were of Malay lineage, coming all the way from Borneo in their swift and sturdy boats called ""Balangay"". Paete is 15 kilometres (9.3mi) from Santa Cruz and 102 kilometres (63mi) from Manila. The name of Paete is derived from the Tagalog word paet, which means chisel. The proper pronunciation of the town's name is Pī-té, long i, short guttural ê, sound at the end. The town was referred to as ""Piety"" by the American Maryknoll Missioners when they came to the town in the late 1950s. Before the Spaniards came, Paete was said to be a village under Gat Lakampawid, a native ruler from the ancient village of Lihan, a relative to Gatmaitim, Gat Silayan, Gat Pakil, the rulers of old town of Pakil. These native rulers from Old Lihan (now Malolos, Bulacan) was scattered along the suburbs of Kingdom of Tondo in the south and settled there. The Spanish friars had a tradition of naming towns they built in honor of saints. Paete was an exception. Legend has it that there was once a young Franciscan priest who was tasked by his superior to visit their newly founded settlements alongside Laguna de Bay. The priest knew little about the terrain so he asked a native the name of the place. The latter misinterpreted the young friar, thinking that the former wanted to know the name of the tool he was using. He answered, Paét (chisel), thus, the name Paete. Sargento Mayor Juan de Salcedo was the first Spaniard to set foot in Paete. He was on his way to explore the gold-rich region of Paracale in Bicol. His men first encountered some resistance from the settlers of what is now Cainta in Rizal Province, but as expected, easily defeated the lightly armed natives. Then he ventured to the lakeside barangays of Laguna de Bay on his way to Bicol. Around 1580, Paete was established as a pueblo by the Friars. Juan de Plasencia and Diego Oropesa. Due to a death of the prior of Paete at that time, Paete was annexed to the Convent of Lumban. Then in 1600, Paete became a barrio of Pangil. In 1602, Paete became independent town having its own convent and was christened Pueblo de San Lorenzo in honor of the town's first patron saint. The pueblo consisted not only of Paete, but included the neighboring towns of Pakil, San Antonio, Longos and Kalayaan. In 1671, Fray Francisco Soller reenacted the Via Crucis to resuscitate the people's waning faith. He carried a cross from the town proper up to Mt. Ping-as in Pakil. In 1676, when Pakil became a separate pueblo, the townspeople of Paete wanted crosses of their own, so they built and located them in sitio Santa Ana, and named the site Tatlong Krus (Three Crosses). Paete regained its full township status only in 1850. In 1899, American forces launched the Laguna campaign to subjugate the whole province and squelch insurrection. On the last leg of the campaign on April 12, an American battalion of 200 men invaded Paete but met strong resistance from an inexperienced force of less than 50 men. The town was subdued but it proved to be a costly battle for the Americans. In 1942, Japanese troops occupied Paete, local recognized guerrillas and ongoing troops under the Philippine Commonwealth Army units were sieges and conflicts in Paete was fought against the Imperial Japanese military and local collaborators from 1942 to 1944 until retreat by local guerrillas from the Japanese hands. In 1945, combined Filipino and American soldiers, as well as recognized guerrillas liberated Paete and defeat by the Japanese and ended in World War II. Paete is politically subdivided into 9 barangays.  Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios. In the 2020 census, the population of Paete was 24,945 people, with a density of 450 inhabitants per square kilometre or 1,200 inhabitants per square mile. The only Catholic Church in the town is the Saint James the Apostle Parish Church which was first built in 1646. Paete is also a pilgrimage site. One of the primary products of the town's woodcarving industry are carving of pu-on or images of saints. The town's patron saint is St. James the Apostle, also known as St. James the Great. Residents celebrate his feastday every 25 July. The 1st Patron Saint of Paete is St. Lawrence, the deacon. St. Anthony the Abbot is a secondary patron of the town and his feast is celebrated by the townsfolk every January 17. The patron has a stone chapel locally known as Ermita as a shrine dedicated to him. There is a town legend related to the saint where a town native sneaked in the chapel during a conflagration and took a statue the St. Anthony to bathe it in the river. Following this, it began to rain and the fire was extinguished, an event considered as a miracle by the townsfolk. The town has had a long reputation for its craftsmen highly skilled in wood carving and its embellishment. In 1887, José Rizal described Paete as a town where ""carpenter shops"" were issuing images ""even those more rudely carved"" (chapter VI, Noli Me Tangere). Even now, its inhabitants (called Paeteños or Paetenians) continue with their centuries-old tradition in carving and painting. Its statues, pulpits, murals and bas relief are found in churches, palaces and museums all over the world, including the St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, the Mission Dolorosa in San Francisco, the San Cayetano Church in Mexico, the St. Joseph's shrine in Santa Cruz, California, various churches in the Philippines and the Ayala Museum in Makati, Philippines. The official town hero is not a statesman nor a soldier but a woodcarver, the master artisan Mariano Madriñan, whose obra maestra, the lifelike Mater Dolorosa, was honored by the King of Spain with a prestigious award in Amsterdam in 1882. The town was proclaimed ""the Carving Capital of the Philippines"" on March 15, 2005, by Philippine President Arroyo. It is also believed that the modern yo-yo, which originated in the Philippines, was invented in Paete. Many descendants of these artisans have found a niche in the culinary world. Ice sculptures and fruit and vegetable carvings done by Paeteños abound on buffet tables of cruise ships and world-class hotels and restaurants. Today the town thrives mainly on the sale and export of woodcarvings and taka (papier maché), tourism, poultry industry, farming and fishing.",Normal
"John Hanson Thomas Jerome (c. 1816 – January 25, 1863) was Mayor of Baltimore from 1850–1852. During Jerome's administration as Mayor of Baltimore, the McDonogh bequest was made to the city from the estate of John McDonogh – a bequest which would later result in the foundation of the McDonogh School. The Maryland Institute Hall, Marsh Market Space and Baltimore Street, was erected (though it was later destroyed in the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904 which destroyed over 1,500 buildings in the city). Bonds to the extent of $1,500,000 of the Northwestern Virginia Railroad were guaranteed by the city. In one of his messages to the Council Mayor Jerome proposed an ambitious programme of municipal development, among which was the acquisition of Federal Hill. He also advocated the purchase of the water-works, then operated under private ownership, and he proposed that if the Gas Company would not illuminate the streets properly, the Municipality should establish its own gas plant. The political separation of Baltimore City and Baltimore County occurred during this administration, wherein an important change became effective with the ratification by the people of the State Constitution in 1851. This resulted in Towson becoming the county seat instead of Baltimore and thus Baltimore became a separate political division of the State. Jerome died on January 25 year 1863 at his house in Govanstown, Baltimore. He was interred at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore.",Normal

After opening the 2006 season with the Class A-Advanced Carolina League's Potomac Nationals, Henderson was sent back to Savannah for three games before returning to Potomac for the rest of the campaign. The Chicago Cubs selected Henderson in the 2006 Rule 5 draft. He played the majority of 2007 with the Double-A Tennessee Smokies in the Southern League except for eight games in the middle of the season with the Triple-A Iowa Cubs in the Pacific Coast League. He began the 2008 season at Tennessee but was promoted to Iowa after five games. He pitched three games at Triple-A Iowa before a shoulder injury ended his season and resulted in his release from the Cubs organization in March 2009. Henderson signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers before the start of the 2009 season. He played the majority of that year with the Class A Wisconsin Timber Rattlers in the Midwest League but was promoted to the Florida State League's Class A-Advanced Brevard County Manatees midseason and the Double-A Southern League's Huntsville Stars in August. Over 26appearances for Wisconsin, Henderson held 1.07earned run average (ERA) with 26strikeouts in 25+1⁄3innings, which earned him a spot in the 2009 Midwest League All-Star Game. He played the entire 2010 season with Huntsville after which he became a free agent. After re-signing with the Brewers, he split the 2011 campaign between Huntsville and the Triple-A Nashville Sounds in the Pacific Coast League. After ten years in the minors, Henderson earned his first promotion to MLB when the Milwaukee Brewers summoned him from Nashville on July 26, 2012, making his major league debut that night against the Washington Nationals, pitching one inning and striking out the first batter he faced, Roger Bernadina. At Nashville, he was selected for the Triple-A All-Star Game with a 1.69ERA, 56strikeouts, 4wins, and 15saves as the Sounds' closer. In 2013, Henderson replaced struggling fellow Canadian-born John Axford as the Brewers' closer. Henderson went 5–5 with a 2.70ERA while collecting 28saves in 32opportunities. His fastball had high velocity, reaching up to 98mph (158kmh), and he established his slider as a strikeout pitch, which established him as a strikeout pitcher, finishing the season with an 11.3K9. Francisco Rodríguez closed while Henderson was on the disabled list (DL) with a hamstring strain, but Henderson regained the role after Rodriguez was traded to the Baltimore Orioles. Henderson won the Brewers closer job for 2014 out of spring training despite experiencing a loss in velocity. This was later revealed to be caused by right shoulder inflammation, and he went on the 15-day DL in April after compiling a 7.15ERA in 14games pitched. Henderson was later transferred to the 60-day DL following a minor league rehab assignment, and he ended up missing the rest of the season after having shoulder surgery in August. Still seeking to reclaim his lost velocity after his 2014 shoulder surgery, Henderson was outrighted to the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox on May 21, 2015. He spent over a month on the DL at Colorado Springs and elected to become a free agent after the season. Henderson signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets for 2015 that included an invitation to spring training. He made the Mets' roster for Opening Day in 2016 after a spring training in which he posted a 1.69ERA with 13strikeouts over 10+2⁄3innings beating out Sean Gilmartin for the last spot in the Mets' bullpen. On June 21, he was placed on the DL with tendinitis in his right biceps. After 14minor league rehab appearances, mostly with the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s, he was activated from the DL and added to the active roster on August 20. He was outrighted to Triple-A after the season and elected free agency. Henderson signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs for 2017 with an invitation to spring training, but he was released before the season's start. In 2018, Henderson signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers. He was assigned to the Double-A Biloxi Shuckers in the Southern League and placed on the 60-Day DL. He was released after the season without having appeared in any games. During the 2018 season, while he was on the Biloxi 60-Day DL, Henderson assisted in Milwaukee's scouting department and served as the bullpen coach for Milwaukee's Class A Short Season Helena Brewers in the Pioneer League. In 2019, he was the pitching coach with the Class A Wisconsin Timber Rattlers. Before the cancellation of the 2020 minor league season, he was slated to be the pitching coach for the Brewers' Triple-A San Antonio Missions. Henderson began serving as pitching coach for the Brewers' new Triple-A affiliate, the Nashville Sounds, in 2021. Henderson was promoted to Milwaukee to serve as their bullpen coach beginning with the 2022 season. Henderson was a member of the gold medal winning Canadian national baseball team at the 2011 Pan American Games. In recognition of the victory, the team was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 2012.",Normal
"The Capitol Records Building, also known as the Capitol Records Tower, is a 13-story tower building in Hollywood, California. Designed by Louis Naidorf of Welton Becket Associates, it is one of the city's landmarks. Construction began soon after British music company EMI acquired Capitol Records in 1955, and was completed in April 1956. Located just north of the Hollywood and Vine intersection, the Capitol Records Tower houses the consolidation of Capitol Records' West Coast operations and is home to the recording studios and echo chambers of Capitol Studios. The building is a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument and sits in the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District. It has been described as the ""world's first circular office building."" The building is known as ""The House That Nat Built"" due to the vast numbers of records and amounts of merchandise Nat King Cole sold for the company. The building's design is on the graduate school drawings of Lou Naidorf who, as the primary architect, designed the first circular office building when he was 24 years old. The wide curved awnings over windows on each story and the tall spike emerging from the top of the building resembles a stack of records on a turntable with the spindle pointing skyward. This resemblance, however, was coincidental, as Welton Becket kept the client's identity secret. Upon first seeing the design, Capitol Records' president Glen Wallichs insisted on a rectangular building, so Naidorf provided Wallichs with both. Wallichs presented both designs to his lender, who felt the round design would attract attention, which would make it easier to lease. Wallichs conceded, choosing Naidorf's initial round design. The rectangular ground floor is a separate structure, joined to the tower after completion. The 13-story conforms to the 150-foot (46m) zoning height limit in place at the time of its construction. Height restrictions were lifted in 1956. The thirteenth floor of the tower is the ""Executive Level"" and is represented by an ""E"" in the building's two elevators. The blinking light atop the tower spells out the word ""Hollywood"" in Morse code. (.... --- .-.. .-.. -.-- .-- --- --- -..) This was an idea of Capitol's then-president, Alan Livingston, who wanted to advertise Capitol's status as the first record label with a base on the west coast. It was switched on by Leila Morse, granddaughter of Samuel Morse. During 1992, the light blinked ""Capitol 50,"" in honor of the label's fiftieth anniversary. A black-and-white graphic of the building appeared on the albums of many Capitol recording artists, with the phrase, ""From the Sound Capitol of the World"". In April 2011, Capitol Records and artist Richard Wyatt Jr. restored his Hollywood Jazz Mural on the south wall of the Capitol Records building. Restored in hand-glazed ceramic tile, the mural spans 26 by 88 feet (7.9 by 26.8m) Entitled ""Hollywood Jazz: 1945-1972"", it presents ""larger than life"" images of a number of notable jazz musicians. The building houses the Capitol Studios, a recording facility which includes eight echo chambers engineered by guitarist Les Paul and three main studios, A, B, and C. Frank Sinatra had a close association with the studios, and the Georg Neumann U 47 microphone he carried around with him is there, often used and maintained for studio sessions. The first album recorded in the tower was Frank Sinatra Conducts Tone Poems of Color. In 2012, Studio A received a new AMS Neve 88R mixing console, designed and built for Al Schmitt and Paul McCartney. In September 2006, EMI sold the tower and adjacent properties for US$50 million to New York developer Argent Ventures. The studio claimed that noise from construction of a condominium threatened it, as well as an underground parking lot by building firm Second Street Ventures would have heavy equipment working within 18 feet (5.5m) of its renowned underground echo chambers, which are themselves over 20 feet (6.1m) below ground level. In November 2012, Steve Barnett was announced as the new Chairman and CEO of the Capitol Music Group and the company stated his office would be in the building. This coincided with Capitol Music Group becoming part of Universal Music Group, assuring its new parent company two Los Angeles headquarters.",Normal

"Cobalt WASD is an action video game developed by Oxeye Game Studio and published by Mojang Studios released on 30 November 2017 for Microsoft Windows. The player plays as either a ""Metalface"" or a ""Protobot"". The Metalfaces try to defend the bomb-sites, while the Protobots try to attack and plant a bomb. When the Protobots plant the bomb, the Metalfaces must try to defuse the bomb before it explodes. The Protobots win when they kill all of the Metalfaces, and the Metalfaces win then they defuse the bomb. At the end of each round, players can choose to buy armor, weapons, or vehicles. While the game mainly focuses on the online multiplayer game mode, there is a mode where the player can play against offline bots. Cobalt WASD is a separate stand-alone spin-off of Cobalt. The developers saw that the original game was too complex for some players and its higher price point discouraged some players, so they wanted to make a completely different game. They decided to make a spin-off of Cobalt, focusing on just one game mode. Eurogamer found Cobalt WASD to be a ""very funny and competitive multiplayer game"". PC Games N called it a ""2D version of Call of Duty's Search and Destroy game mode"".",Normal

"Meaghan Hughes (born January 3, 1986) is a Canadian curler from Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. She is a four-time PEI junior champion skip and five-time PEI Scotties champion. Hughes played as skip for her junior career, skipping the PEI team at the Canadian Junior Curling Championships from 2003–06. In 2003, her team finished eleventh with a 2–10 record. In 2004, she improved from the previous season finishing in eighth with a 5–7 record. Her best finish was in 2005 where she once again finished eighth but this time with a 6–6 record. At her final trip to the juniors in 2006, she finished in last place with a 3–8 record. Also during her junior career, she won the 17 & Under provincial championship in 2002 and skipped Prince Edward Island to a sixth place finish at the 2003 Canada Winter Games. Hughes skipped her team of Stefanie Clark, Jackie Reid and Tricia Affleck at the 2012 Prince Edward Island Scotties Tournament of Hearts where they finished the round robin in first place with a 4–1 record, earning them the bye to the final where they would play Kim Dolan. Despite starting the final with the hammer, she gave up a three ender in the seventh end and a steal of one in the eighth, ultimately losing the match 6–4. Hughes teamed up with Kathy O'Rourke for the 2012–13 season with Reid and Affleck at second and lead. The team competed at the 2013 Prince Edward Island Scotties Tournament of Hearts where they lost in the semifinal to Kim Dolan. Hughes moved down to third the following season and Robyn MacPhee stepped in to throw fourth rocks for the team. They finished undefeated throughout the round robin of the 2014 Prince Edward Island Scotties Tournament of Hearts but were defeated in the final by Dolan. They had a strong start to the 2014–15 season, winning the Curl Atlantic Championship and finishing second at the Dave Jones Molson Mayflower Cashspiel and the Lady Monctonian Invitational Spiel. Despite their strong season, they once again lost in the semifinal of the 2015 Prince Edward Island Scotties Tournament of Hearts, this time to Suzanne Birt. Team O'Rourke disbanded after the season and Hughes and Green joined Birt's rink that had also disbanded. They played in the 2015 Tour Challenge Tier 2 where they made the quarterfinals. The team also won the Sobeys Classic on the World Curling Tour. Hughes would win her first provincial championship in 2016 when the team defeated Kim Dolan 5–4 in the final of the 2016 Prince Edward Island Scotties Tournament of Hearts They represented PEI at the 2016 Scotties Tournament of Hearts where they went 4–7. Birt stepped away from competitive curling after the season and Green (now MacPhee) moved back to the skip position. They won the Royal LePage OVCA Women's Fall Classic and finished runner-up at the Lady Monctonian Invitational Spiel once again.

Team Birt began the 2020–21 season with two runner-up finishes at the 2020 The Curling Store Cashspiel and the 2020 Dave Jones Stanhope Simpson Insurance Mayflower Cashspiel. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Prince Edward Island, many teams had to opt out of the 2021 Prince Edward Island Scotties Tournament of Hearts as they could not commit to the quarantine process in order to compete in the 2021 Scotties Tournament of Hearts. This meant that only Team Birt and their clubmates Darlene London's rink entered the event. In the best-of-five series, Team Birt defeated Team London three games to zero to earn the right to represent Prince Edward Island at the 2021 Scotties in Calgary, Alberta. At the Tournament of Hearts, they finished a 4–4 round robin record, failing to qualify for the championship round. The Birt rink had two appearances in finals to begin the 2021–22 season.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, the qualification process for the 2021 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials had to be modified to qualify enough teams for the championship. In these modifications, Curling Canada created the 2021 Canadian Curling Trials Direct-Entry Event, an event where five teams would compete to try to earn one of three spots into the 2021 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials. Team Birt qualified for the Trials Direct-Entry Event due to their CTRS ranking from the 2019–20 season. The team went 1–3 through the round robin, finishing in last place and not advancing directly to the Trials. Team Birt had one final chance to advance to the Olympic Trials through the 2021 Canadian Olympic Curling Pre-Trials where they finished the round robin with a 4–2 record. This qualified them for the double knockout round, where they lost both of their games and were eliminated. The team had two more tour stops during the season, which included winning the Stu Sells 1824 Halifax Classic and reaching the semifinal of the Tim Hortons Spitfire Arms Cash Spiel. The 2022 Prince Edward Island Scotties Tournament of Hearts was cancelled due to the pandemic and Team Birt were selected to represent their province at the national women's championship. The team finished the 2022 Scotties Tournament of Hearts with a 4–4 record, fifth place in their pool. In advance of the 2022–23 season, Team Birt won a fan vote which qualified them for the 2022 PointsBet Invitational. They lost their opening round game to the Rachel Homan rink. On tour, the team won two events. In October, they won the Superstore Monctonian Challenge with spares Colleen Jones and Sinead Dolan filling in for Marie Christianson and Michelle Shea. They then won the Jim Sullivan Curling Classic in November, going undefeated in the event. They also had a semifinal appearance at the New Scotland Clothing Women's Cashspiel.

"Roy Elwood Clausen (August 21, 1891, Randall, Iowa – August 21, 1956, Berkeley, California) was a biochemist, botanist, plant geneticist, and drosophilist. Clausen was the eldest of six siblings. As a boy with his family, he moved from Iowa to Newkirk, Oklahoma, in 1900. In 1910, he graduated with a bachelor of science degree in agriculture from Stillwater's Oklahoma A&M (later renamed Oklahoma State University). In 1910, Clausen matriculated at the University of California, Berkeley. There, Clausen graduated in 1912 with a second bachelor's degree, in agriculture, with a major in plant pathology. He graduated in 1914 with a Ph.D. in biochemistry, with a minor in plant pathology. His thesis advisor was Thorburn Brailsford Robertson. From 1914 until his death in 1956, Clausen was a faculty member at UC Berkeley. During World War I, he was on an eighteen-month leave of absence when he served in the U.S. Army as a supply officer in a depot brigade. During World War II, he was on another leave of absence when he served in 1944 and 1945 as a personnel officer at the Los Alamos Laboratory. As a graduate assistant of William Albert Setchell, Clausen began investigating the genus Nicotiana and continued this research until he died in 1956. Early in his career, he studied the genetics of Drosophila but eventually concentrated on the genetics of Nicotiana and gave his Drosophila stocks to the geneticist Walter Poppino Spencer (1898–1969). For about twenty years, up to 1926, Clausen collaborated with Thomas Harper Goodspeed. From an analysis of chromosome pairing in hybrids of Nicotania species, Clausen and Goodspeed were the first to provide empirical evidence for Winge's hypothesis of plant hybridization following chromosome doubling. After 1934, Clausen collaborated extensively with Donald Ross Cameron (1907–1984). Clausen's pioneering studies on unbalanced chromosomal types—haploids, trisomics, monosomic—culminated in the recognition of a complete set of twenty-four monosomics in N. tabacum. However, he was not content merely to isolate and describe the monosomics, but through their use to develop a powerful new tool of genetic analysis. He demonstrated how monosomic analysis makes it possible to study, chromosome by chromosome, the genetic differences between the cultivated species N. tabacum, a natural amphidiploid (doubled hybrid), and a series of raw amphidiploids synthesized by doubling the chromosomes of sterile hybrids between putative ancestral species. With Ernest B. Babcock, Clausen wrote Genetics in Relation to Agriculture (1918), with a second edition in 1927. After his return from Los Alamos, he served as the chair of UC Berkeley's department of genetics. Clausen was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1951. He was the president of the Genetics Society of America in 1953. He married Mae Winifred Falls in 1916. He died from a heart attack in 1956, and his widow died in 1959.",Normal

"The blood–spinal cord barrier (BSCB) is a semipermeable anatomical interface that consists of the specialized small blood vessels that surround the spinal cord. While similar to the blood–brain barrier in function and morphology, it is physiologically independent and has several distinct characteristics. The BSCB is involved in many disorders affecting the central nervous system, including neurodegenerative diseases, pain disorders, and traumatic spinal cord injury. In conjunction with the blood–brain barrier, the BSCB contributes to the difficulty in delivering drugs to the central nervous system, which makes drug targeting of the BSCB an important goal in pharmaceutical research. The primary function of the BSCB is to protect the spinal cord from potentially toxic substances within the blood while still delivering necessary molecules to maintain spinal cord activities. The BSCB consists of endothelial cells, a basal membrane, pericytes, and astrocytic endfeet. The endothelial cells have highly exclusionary tight junctions that prohibit most molecules from passing between cells and form specialized capillaries that, unlike capillaries in the periphery, lack fenestrations, have more mitochondria, and contain limited endocytic vesicles. The lack of fenestrations and endocytic vesicles reflects the restricted transcellular flow, while the increased number of mitochondria contributes to a high metabolic rate in these endothelial cells. Surrounding the BSCB capillaries is a basal membrane (also called the basal lamina) that contains pericytes. The basal membrane is formed and maintained by all cell types in the BSCB and contributes to the cytoskeletal morphology of the endothelial cells, which affects the integrity of tight junctions and, by extension, the BSCB. Pericytes are microcirculatory cells that, in the BSCB, regulate the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of endothelial cells. Finally, astrocytes within spinal cord tissue extend endfoot processes that surround the outer surface of the capillaries. Astrocytes are critically important for developing and maintaining the neuroprotective mechanisms of BSCB endothelial cells. They release secretory compounds that influence the phenotype of endothelial cells and express aquaporin and potassium channels that help regulate ion concentration and fluid volume within the spinal cord. The anatomy of the BSCB is very similar to the anatomy of the blood–brain barrier (BBB); however many key differences exist between the two that affect both the maintenance of healthy tissue and development of pathophysiology within the central nervous system (CNS). In general, the BSCB is more permeable than the BBB, largely due to the relatively low expression of tight junction proteins like ZO-1 and occludin. For example, mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, crosses BSCB endothelium more readily than it does BBB endothelium. Cytokines are also able to pass through the BSCB with more ease, making it more vulnerable to disruption and inflammation relative to the BBB. This vulnerability to disruption leaves the spinal cord susceptible to toxins that can inflict tissue damage. Susceptibility to toxins is already increased in BSCB endothelium through the relative downregulation of the critical efflux protein p-glycoprotein, thus slowing elimination of the toxins that penetrate the barrier. Overall, the differences between the BSCB and the BBB result in vulnerability to certain diseases and disorders affecting the CNS. Research shows that the BSCB plays a significant role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, spinal cord injury, pain conditions, and other disorders that affect the CNS. Because of its function as a protective barrier for the spinal cord, disruption of the BSCB exposes spinal cord tissue to inflammatory signals, pathogens, and toxins. Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) are debilitating incurable conditions that frequently result in lifelong disability and dysfunction. They occur when a mechanical force is applied to the spinal column, most often from motor vehicle accidents and falls. This impact disrupts the capillaries around the spinal cord and initiates many pathophysiological cascades by allowing the molecules and cells within the bloodstream to enter nervous tissue. Within five minutes following the initial injury, normally impermeable blood components like the large molecule albumin or red blood cells can be detected in spinal cord tissue. Because of this sudden infiltration of normally absent particles, an inflammatory response is triggered by astrocytes and microglia that extends the initial injury into previously uncompromised segments of cord. This secondary injury can contribute heavily to long term loss of function and disability. Because the disruption of the BSCB is a major exacerbating factor in SCIs, reestablishment of normal function is critical to reducing the severity of injury outcomes. Some studies in rats with induced SCIs have shown that reestablishment can occur as early as 14 days following the initial injury; however, other studies have shown the BSCB can be compromised as long as 56 days after injury. Depending on the type and severity of the injury inducing force, the time it takes the BSCB to reestablish itself varies. For example, if the initial injury includes excessive separation of the basement membrane from the blood vessels, a space is created that can accommodate more immune cells and thus propagate damaging inflammation. Additionally, widening of the tight junctions adhering endothelial cells and oxidative stress are both associated with a long-term increase in BSCB permeability. Inflammation, compromised tight junctions, and oxidative stress are all contributors to a severe complication of SCI called post-traumatic syringomyelia. In post-traumatic syringomyelia, the structural and function loss of integrity of the BSCB encourages the development of fluid filled cysts within the spinal cord, causing pain and worsening disability. As such, the sooner the BSCB is restored, the better the prognosis is for someone after a SCI. BSCB disruption has been found as a predecessor and possible initiator for certain neurodegenerative diseases, though the mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a chronic, progressive, and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disease that is caused by the death of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. These motor neurons control voluntary movements, so their degradation and death lead to symptoms like difficulty moving, weakness, trouble speaking and swallowing, muscle cramping, and muscle twitching that worsen over time. Only 5-10% of ALS cases have an identifiable cause, most often is a mutation in the gene SOD1. Regardless of whether the cause is idiopathic or genetic, ALS is associated with significant dysfunction of the endothelium and basement membrane of the CNS, with the BSCB being more effected than the BBB. Patients with ALS have been found to have decreased expression of certain proteins, like ZO-1 or claudin-5, that weaken the integrity of the tight junctions. The membranes of endothelial cells have increased permeability, and this may contribute more to pathology than the tight junctions being compromised. Furthermore, studies with rat models have shown that the initial phases of ALS result in a loss of 10-15% of the BSCB capillary length, edema, and collapsed capillary beds. These vasculature changes preceded motor neuron death, indicating that BSCB breakdown may facilitate tissue damage. With the endothelium compromised, proteins and antibodies can infiltrate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Proteins like albumin and antibodies like IgG are too large to pass through the BSCB on their own, so their presence in CSF indicates a leaky endothelium. These blood compounds are toxic to nervous tissue and precipitate neuroinflammation, edema, and eventual motor neuron death. Multiple sclerosis (MS), a neurodegenerative, autoimmune disease that deteriorates the myelin sheath coating axons and causes permanent damage to nerves, has also been associated with capillary and barrier dysfunction. Many studies support the idea that CNS barrier disruption precedes MS, particularly through altered tight junction protein expression. Weakened tight junctions cause fragility in the barrier that can lead to immune system invasion, demyelination, and axonal damage. The BSCB is more susceptible to immune invasion because tight junctions are weak by default, relative to the BBB. Neutrophils are among the first immune cells found in early MS pathology; through their role as potent modulators of dendritic cell recruitment and function, they initiate an immune response that ultimately results in T-cell activation and infiltration. As such, decreased population of neutrophils correlates strongly with decreased MS pathology, indicating that strengthening of BSCB tight junctions may be a useful therapeutic target. Neuropathy is a type of severe chronic pain that is caused by disease and dysfunction of the somatosensory system that allows for perception of touch, pain, vibration, and other sensations. Many conditions can cause neuropathy, including diabetes, HIV, SCI, transverse myelitis, MS, amputation, peripheral nerve pain. At its core, neuropathy occurs when the central excitatory and inhibitory nerves in the somatosensory system are altered in some way, as this leads to dysfunctional sensory signaling. Triggering changes in the pain signaling pathway occurs the neuroimmune interactions, such as the release of proinflammatory mediators into the spinal cord that are known to promote central sensitization (wherein sensory nerves are activated more easily) and hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain). The BSCB is the main anatomical structure that regulates the interaction between the immune system and the nervous system, so its role in neuropathy is of pharmacological interest. While it does not occur in all cases, some people who experience peripheral nerve injury develop neuropathy through the signaling induced by the injury. It results in increased BSCB permeability that allows white blood cells to migrate into the spinal cord, where they can release mediators that alter function. This forms a positive feedback loop: an injury causes cytokines, a type of signaling molecule, to be released, which induces BSCB disruption that allows white blood cell migration, followed by the white blood cells releasing more cytokines within the spinal cord, keeping the BSCB hyperpermeable. It has been found that blocking the signaling of certain cytokines in cases of neuropathy attenuates the BSCB permeability, decreases the amount of infiltrating immune cells, and ultimately decreases hyperalgesia. Similar to the BBB, the majority of small molecule drugs and virtually all large molecule and biological drugs cannot penetrate the BSCB, making treatment of spinal cord diseases difficult. Furthermore, drugs that do pass through the barrier may be subjected to efflux by specialized efflux pumps such as p-glycoprotein and breast-cancer resistance protein, which prevents concentration of therapeutic relevance being reached. Because of this, the majority of nervous system disorders have limited treatments that may involve invasive means of administration. There are two major pharmacological goals regarding drug delivery to the CNS: the first is finding ways to repair CNS tissue (including the BBB and BSCB) after it has been damaged, and the second is creating methods of drug delivery that improve therapy. If a drug is capable of crossing the BBB or BSCB, then it can be administered orally, rectally, intravenously, etc. However, for drugs that cannot cross the BBBBSCB, there must be either a method of bypassing the barriers or the creation of a drug delivery system that allows penetration. Methods of bypassing the BSCB directly include intrathecal injection (into the spinal canal), intracerebroventricular injection (into the ventricles of the brain, which produce CSF that flows down the CNS), epidural injection (into the epidural space), and depot or implant placement, such as a placement of a catheter. Regarding current treatment strategies for CNS diseases, there is unfortunately no cure for most damaging afflictions of the spinal cord. Treatment is generally aimed at reducing symptoms and slowing progression of disease. In MS, treatment centers around immunomodulatory drugs that can cross the BBBBSCB. Corticosteroids are a common choice, as they can modulate immune function and decrease symptom severity during an attack. Some anti-cancer drugs, like mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide, have immunosuppressant effects that slow disease progression. In ALS, only two drugs are approved to slow progression and they are incapable of reversing symptoms once they arise: masitinib, which prevents abnormal glial cells from activating and proliferating, and ibudilast, which inhibits cytokine release form activated microglia. Both drugs have been shown to slow degeneration and improve overall survival time, though it is of utmost importance to begin treatment as early as possible. Antiepileptics are sometimes given off-label for ALS, since hyperexcitability is thought to contribute to motor neuron death; no antiepileptic has been approved for this use, though. Neuropathic conditions can be managed with pharmaceutically with anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and opioids; however, other treatments involving neuromodulation (deep brain stimulation, motor cortex stimulation, spinal cord stimulation, etc.) have shown efficacy in reducing pain. Most pharmaceutical research involving the BSCB aims to find efficient methods of overcoming its barrier mechanism to improve drug delivery. This can include directly bypassing the barrier, such as by placing a drug-eluting depot or injecting directly into the CNS, preventing efflux, such as with p-glycoprotein inhibitors, or by enhancing drug penetration. The BBBBSCB can be deliberately disrupted to increase paracellular transport of drugs to the CNS. An established method of accomplishing this is through osmotic disruption. CSF is nearly isosmotic to blood, so if a hyperosmotic agent, such as mannitol, is administered intravascularly, the osmolarity gap between the blood and CSF widens, resulting in fluid flow from CNS tissue into blood vessels. Hyperosmotic agents are already in clinical use as diuretics, though mannitol is also approved to treat increased intracranial pressure, as it draws fluid out of the brain and thus decreases the volume-induced pressure. However, hyperosmolarity may also be of use in drug delivery since it causes the membranes of endothelial cells to shrink, resulting in tight junctions stretching and paracellular gaps widening. Widened paracellular gaps can facilitate passage of larger molecules that otherwise would be unable to cross the BBBBSCB. This method is not commonly used due to adverse effects such as dehydration and, in some cases, exacerbation of injury. Nanoparticles are composed of nano-sized particles that have widespread medical application. There are different types of nanoparticle, including polymeric (natural and artificial), liposomallipid-based, and inorganic. The most relevant nanoparticle type to treating CNS disease are lipid-based nanoparticles, as the lipophilicity of the particle allows for higher permeability in the BBBBSCB. The goal of nanoparticles in this context are to successfully enter CNS tissue and release its drug cargo safely. They gain entry in two major ways: adsorption-mediated transport and receptor-mediated transport. In adsorption-mediated transport, the nanoparticle is covered in positive charges that interact with the negative charges found on the endothelium. In receptor-mediated transport, nanoparticles are covered in ligands that bind receptors found on the BBBBSCB, so that when it encounters these receptors, endocytosis is triggered, and the nanoparticle is ferried across the endothelium. There is ongoing issue with nanoparticles as a whole, particularly regarding accumulation in the targeted region and cytotoxicity; however, nanoparticles have been found to be of incredible use to medical research and hold promise as a method of drug delivery to the CNS.",Normal
"David Neres Campos (Brazilian Portuguese: ; born 3 March 1997) is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a winger for Primeira Liga club Benfica and the Brazil national team. Neres is a graduate of São Paulo's youth system and was promoted to the first team in 2016. He joined Ajax in January 2017. At Ajax, Neres established himself as one of the best young wingers in Europe, after winning a domestic double and being instrumental part of Ajax's first UEFA Champions League semi-final appearance in 22 years, in a breakthrough 2018–19 season. The following seasons, were marked by continuous injuries resulted in Neres playing a limited amount of games and declining in performances, leading him to move to Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk, and then transferred to Benfica for €15.3 million. After representing Brazil at various youth levels, Neres was called up to the full international team for the first time in March 2019, and was part of the squad that took part won the 2019 Copa América. Born in São Paulo, Neres joined São Paulo's youth setup in September 2007, aged ten. In February 2016, after being regularly used in that year's U-20 Copa Libertadores, he suffered a shoulder injury which kept him sidelined for months. Neres was promoted to the main squad by manager Ricardo Gomes in August 2016. He made his first team – and Série A debut – on 17 October, coming on as a second-half substitute for Robson in a 2–1 away win against Fluminense. On 22 October 2016 Neres scored his first goal, netting the last in a 2–0 home win against Ponte Preta. Fourteen days later he scored his second goal, netting the second in a 4–0 home routing of local rival Corinthians. On 30 January 2017, Neres moved to the Dutch club Ajax for a reported fee of €12 million. Neres made his debut for Ajax against Heracles Almelo, on 26 February 2017. In that season, he managed to get 3 goals in 8 league matches. He also featured in an Ajax team that went to the UEFA Europa League final that year. Neres managed to get 14 goals and 13 assists in 32 league matches, making him the most valuable player of Ajax that year, having scored the most goals and assists combined. Neres himself sees the game against Feyenoord, on 22 October 2017, as his breakthrough, where he racked up three assists in a 4–1 away win. In his third season, Neres scored his first official European goal against Standard Liège in the second leg of the third qualifying round of the Champions League. In that year, Neres wasn't guaranteed a starting spot up until February. Because of this, there were rumours that Neres wanted to leave. In January, Guangzhou Evergrande made a £36.9 million bid on Neres, but Ajax ultimately refused, because they wanted to keep the team together to win prizes that year and make it far in the UEFA Champions League. In the second leg in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League, in a memorable game against Real Madrid, Neres scored the second goal to give Ajax the lead on aggregate, and the Dutch side eventually won a by a margin of 5–3, thus knocking the three-time defending European champions out of the competition. On 31 March 2019, Neres scored the winning goal and picked up a penalty in the championship clash against PSV, to win 3–1. He also scored an important equaliser against Juventus at home to secure hopes for Ajax's semi-final qualification in the first leg at home. Neres won his first Eredivisie title as Ajax finished three points ahead of rivals PSV. Neres also won his first KNVB Cup when Ajax won 4–0 against Willem II in the final. Despite reported interest from the likes of Manchester United and Atlético Madrid, Neres signed a new contract with Ajax on 7 August 2019 that runs through 2023. The deal added a further year to his prior deal that was set to expire in 2022. At the start of the 2020–21 season, Neres came back after his injury. On November 22, he scored his first goal in more than a year. Since Ajax acquired Mohamed Daramy and Steven Berghuis as wingers at the beginning of the season, competition for Neres increased, as a result of which he was often no longer included in the starting lineup. On 11 January 2022 it was reported that Neres was sold to Ukrainian Premier League side Shakhtar Donetsk for a reported fee of €15 million, which can potentially run up to €17 million with bonuses. On 14 January, Ajax confirmed that the transfer had been completed. On 24 February 2022 following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, a video was shared online of various Brazilian men's footballers pleading for help from the Brazilian government to help them flee the country. On 1 March 2022 it was reported that the Brazilian players had successfully made it to Romania, from where they travelled home. UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin was personally involved in helping to facilitate the return to safety. On 20 June 2022, Neres signed a five-year contract with Primeira Liga side Benfica, for a reported fee of €15.3 million. The net cost of the transaction was only €300,000, with both Benfica and Shakhtar settling an agreement for the latter's debt, due to the transfer of compatriot and former teammate Pedrinho, which whom Shakhtar had only paid €3 million of a total of €18 million. He made his debut for the club on 2 August, providing two assists to Gonçalo Ramos in the 4–1 home win over Midtjylland in the 1st leg of the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round. On August 23, Neres scored his first goal for the club and provided an assist in the 3–0 home win over Dynamo Kyiv in the 2nd leg of the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League play-off round, helping his side qualify to the tournament. Seven days later, he scored his first Primeira Liga goal in a 3–2 home victory over Paços de Ferreira, reaching six goal contributions in six games. On 8 March 2019, Neres received his first senior team call-up by coach Tite for the Brazil national football team, replacing an injured Vinícius Júnior, for the friendlies against Panama and the Czech Republic to be held later that month. Neres made his senior team debut against Czech Republic on 26 March 2019, in the 63rd minute as a replacement for Richarlison. In that game, he made an assist and produced a backheel which led to a goal, contributing to two goals in the 3–1 win against Czech Republic. On 12 July 2020, Neres' girlfriend, German model Kira Winona, gave birth to their first child. Their daughter is named Hope Winona Neres. Scores and results list Brazil's goal tally first.

"Johann Friedrich Karl Keil or Carl Friedrich Keil (26 February 1807– 5 May 1888) was a conservative German Lutheran Old Testament commentator. Keil was appointed to the theological faculty of Dorpat in Estonia where he taught Bible, New Testament exegesis, and Oriental languages. In 1859 he was called to serve the Lutheran church in Leipzig. In 1887 he moved to Rödletz, where he died. Keil was a conservative critic who reacted strongly against the scientific biblical criticism of his day. He strongly supported Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch. He maintained the validity of the historico-critical investigation of the Bible only if it proved the existence of New Testament revelation in the Scriptures. To this aim he edited (with Franz Delitzsch) his principal work, a commentary on the Bible, Biblischer Kommentar über das Alte Testament (5 vols., 1866–82; Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament, 5 vols., 1872–77). The work remains his most enduring contribution to biblical studies. He also published commentaries on Maccabees and New Testament literature. Keil was born at Lauterbach near Oelsnitz, Kingdom of Saxony, and died at Rätz, Saxony. He is best known for his contributions to the Keil and Delitzsch commentaries, a ten-volume set written with Franz Delitzsch. Keil was a student of Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg.

"Paramontana rufozonata, common name red-zoned turrid, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Raphitomidae. The length of the shell attains 5 mm. (Original description) The fusiformly turreted, solid shell is white, sometimes with a zone of double interrupted chestnut lines near the base of the body whorl, similar chestnut markings being occasionally apparent here and there near the upper portion of the whorls. The shell contains 6 whorls, convex, longitudinally ribbed and crossed with transverse ridges that become sharply and prominently nodulous upon the ribs. The spire is sharp with a light brown apex. The aperture is narrowly quadrate. The outer lip is varicose and denticulated. The posterior sinus is moderate.  (Discussion as Pseudodaphnella rufozonata by Charles Hedley) By G. B. Sowerby  this species was united to P. tincta Reeve, and to P. albifuniculata Reeve, an arrangement copied by Pritchard and Gatliff. But P. rufozonata is only two-thirds the height of P. tincta, is of a more slender build, and lacks the peculiar excavate base of that tropical species. The latter feature is shown in Reeve's figure, and is mentioned by Hervier  as the "" depression circulaire autour de son canal basal."" The records by Melvill and Standen  and by Bouge and Dautzenberg  of P. rufozonata, from the Loyalty Islands, are doubtless due to the confusion between this and P. tincta. P. rufozonata is indeed more nearly related to P. albifuniculata Reeve, but is smaller, more fusiform, and has the radials more prominent owing to the spirals being slighter. A more distant relation is P. barnardi, easily separable by the heavier sculpture and striking colour pattern. This marine species is endemic to Australia and occurs off New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria.",Normal

"Joaquim ""Jack"" M. Martins (born June 19, 1967) is an American attorney and politician serving as a member of the New York State Senate for the 7th district. A Republican, he previously served as mayor of Mineola, New York. Martins is a first-generation Portuguese American. He was born in Queens, New York, to parents who emigrated to the United States in the 1960s. He has two brothers and two sisters and was raised in Mineola. Upon graduating from Chaminade High School, he received a bachelor's degree in political science from American University in 1988. Additionally, Martins received a Juris Doctor from St. John's University School of Law in 1991. Martins was elected mayor of the Village of Mineola, New York in 2003. In 2008, Martins ran for Congress against incumbent Democratic U.S. Representative Carolyn McCarthy (D-Mineola). He was defeated by a wide margin. Martins won election to the New York State Senate in 2010 as the representative for New York's 7th State Senate district. He defeated incumbent Democratic senator Craig M. Johnson by 451 votes. The election results were not certified until December 4, 2010. Johnson challenged the results and demanded a hand recount, but the New York Court of Appeals rejected his appeal on December 20, 2010. As Senator, Martins voted for the law creating New York State's property tax cap, voted to cut income taxes for middle-class homeowners, voted to repeal the MTA payroll tax for small businesses and schools, and supported repealing the MTA payroll tax in its entirety. He authored laws reducing busing costs for school districts; creating a truss notification system to improve safety for volunteer firefighters; and establishing a new state fund to help homeless veterans. In 2011, Martins voted against allowing same-sex marriage in New York during rollcall for the Marriage Equality Act, which narrowly passed, legalizing it by 33 to 29. Martins was highly critical of the New York State Education Department's implementation of the Common Core standards and called for the resignation of the State's Commissioner of Education for cancelling public forums on the issue with parents and teachers. While in the Senate, Martins repeatedly led Long Island's 31 state legislators in the number of bills sponsored that were ultimately passed by both houses of the State Legislature. In February 2016, Martins and state Assemblywoman Michelle Schimel called for new state funding to support a comprehensive groundwater study for Long Island. An expanded version of their proposal was adopted by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Martins sponsored legislation that would prevent New York from entering into a state contract or investment with those who boycott Israel or other American allies. Martins served as chairman of the State Senate's Labor Committee and was co-chair of the Senate's Task Force on Workforce Development. He previously chaired the Senate's Commerce, Economic Development and Small Business Committee and the Senate's Local Government Committee.

"Casey Michael Beathard (ˈbɛθərd BETH-ərd; born December 2, 1965) is an American country music songwriter. The son of former NFL general manager Bobby Beathard, and father of current Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback C. J. Beathard, and country music artist Tucker Beathard, he has co-written singles for several country music recording artists, including top-ten singles for Gary Allan, Billy Ray Cyrus, Trace Adkins, Kenny Chesney, and Eric Church. In 2004 and 2008, he received Broadcast Music, Inc.'s Songwriter of the Year award for his contributions. Casey Beathard graduated in 1984 from Oakton High School, Vienna, Virginia, where he was a football star. Beathard graduated from Elon University in Elon, North Carolina, in 1990 with a degree in business management. While at Elon, he was a member of Kappa Sigma Fraternity and played football. Beathard moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1991 to find work as a songwriter. After finding work at various jobs in Nashville, he was eventually signed to a songwriting contract; his first cut as a songwriter was the title track of Kenny Chesney's 1998 album I Will Stand, which was released as a single that year. (Chesney later recorded ""No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems"", another Beathard co-write, in 2002.) By the 2000s, many other country music artists had recorded Beathard's material, including Trace Adkins, Gary Allan, Tracy Byrd, and Billy Currington. For his contributions as a songwriter, Beathard received a Songwriter of the Year award from Broadcast Music Incorporated in 2004 and 2008. In 2006, he received his first credit as a record producer, when he co-produced the track ""I Wanna Feel Something"" on Trace Adkins' Dangerous Man album. This was also Adkins' first co-production credit. A year later, Beathard received additional honors from BMI as the co-writer of Tracy Lawrence's single ""Find Out Who Your Friends Are"", Lawrence's first number one in eleven years, and the first single for his personal Rocky Comfort label. Beathard's son, C. J. Beathard, is a backup quarterback for the Jacksonville Jaguars. He played at the University of Iowa and was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the 2017 NFL draft. Another son, Tucker Beathard, is signed to Dot Records as a recording artist. His son Clayton, a quarterback at Long Island University, was fatally stabbed during an altercation that began at around 2:50a.m. Saturday, December 21, 2019, outside of the Dogwood Bar & Grill in Nashville. Several of Casey Beathard's songs are up-tempo party anthems, occasionally centering on alcoholic beverages. The latter theme is most evident on the three cuts recorded by Byrd—""Ten Rounds with Jose Cuervo"", ""Drinkin' Bone"", and ""How'd I Wind Up in Jamaica""—as well as Trent Willmon's debut single ""Beer Man"", and ""The World Needs a Drink"" by Terri Clark. He has occasionally shown a more serious side to his songs as well, such as Jeff Bates's ""The Love Song"", Billy Currington's ""Walk a Little Straighter"", Billy Ray Cyrus's ""Ready, Set, Don't Go"", and Eric Church's ""Homeboy"".",Normal
"Productive aging refers to activities which older people engage in on a daily basis. Older adults have opportunities and constraints which are related to the productive aging process. The community and society need to develop more options for older adults to choose their way of being engaged in the community and contributing to others. Things such as policy changes and resource commitments are important to promote productive aging. One example of productive aging is retirement which moves older adults from paid forms of productivity to non-paid activities. Many activities can give older adults opportunities and constraints related to the productive aging process. These activities include retirement, employment, economic well-being, leisure, religious participation and spirituality, membership in community associations and volunteerism, education, and political action. Older adults will find many opportunities to engage in activities which contribute to society or follow personal creative activities.",Normal

"Fuchsia excorticata, commonly known as tree fuchsia, New Zealand fuchsia and by its Māori name kōtukutuku, is a New Zealand native tree belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is commonly found throughout New Zealand and as far south as the Auckland Islands. It grows from sea level up to about 1,000m (3,300ft), particularly alongside creeks and rivers. It is easily recognised in its native environment by the characteristic appearance of its bark, which peels spontaneously, hanging in red papery strips to show a pale bark underneath. Its scientific name, excorticata, reflects this distinctive property. Fuchsia excorticata is the largest member of the genus Fuchsia, growing to a height of 15m (50ft). It is unusual among New Zealand trees in being deciduous in the southern parts of its range. The introduction of the common brushtail possum to New Zealand precipitated a serious decline in this species, particularly where large concentrations of the possum are present. F. excorticata appears to be one of the possum's preferred food sources, and they will browse individual trees to the point of defoliation after which the trees will die. The small dark purple berry is sweet and juicy. It was favoured by Māori who, unusually, gave the fruit its own name of kōnini or māti; it was also eaten by European settlers in jams and puddings. The Māori name kōtukutuku is derived from tukutuku meaning ""to let go"" referring to its flaky bark. The fruit name kōnini comes from an Eastern Polynesian term for Caulerpa racemosa which the developing fruit looks similar to. Māti comes from Proto-Polynesian *mati originally referring to Ficus tinctoria (compare Tahitian: mati, Tongan: masi). Fuchsia excorticata is the largest species of Fuchsia in the world. This species differs in appearances from others in New Zealand. This species is deciduous, found most commonly in tree or shrub form. It typically grows to an average height of 12 metres high. It is distinguishable by a noticeably light brownorange bark, which is extremely thin and paper like, peeling in strips. Overall trunk diameter tends to be 60cm with stout outreaching branches. Main description of the leaves of this species include slim petioles, the join being approximately 1–4cm long. The leaves tend to be up to 10cm and ranging from 1.5–3cm wide. Leaves tend to form an oblong shape with a rounded base. Leaves of Fuchsia excorticata have a smooth epidermis with the exception of the margin and veins. The leaf margin is serrated with small teeth. Leaf colour can vary the upper side generally being dark green and the underside being paler and more silver in colour. Leaves can sometimes be suffused with red or purple colouring. Fuchsia excorticata is uncommon for its characteristic of being deciduous in southern areas of New Zealand, where the majority of its competing species are large evergreen species. Therefore, in the winter months Fuchsia excorticata is conspicuous by being found with few to no leaves. Flowers are usually bright red to pink to purple in colour and often emerge from the main stem. Flowers are solitary and pendulous. The four showy sepals tend to be 5–16mm long. Filaments tending to range from 7–12mm in length and purplish in colour. The flowers of Fuchsia excorticata are gynodioecious. Berries range to approximately 10mm long, ellipsoid-oblong shaped, dark purple to almost black in colour. Fuchsia excorticata is endemic to New Zealand. Fuchsia excorticata has a range throughout the North and South Islands, as well as Stewart Island and the Auckland Islands. Fuchsia excorticata is common in lowland and lower mountainous forest areas, especially on the forest margins, in clearings, and by streams. Even if a forest is close to being destroyed, or is destroyed, tree fuchsias are more than often not still standing because they are close to indestructible. This species is also abundant in cold mountain areas in the South Island. The seeds of Fuchsia excorticata are fairly small, though are known to have persistence in the soil. It is unknown how long they are viable for, but can germinate in just two weeks if the conditions are suitable. In dark conditions, germination could take up to eight weeks. Because the seeds are so small, seedlings are fragile and may have a hard time establishing themselves. F. excorticata is a gynodioecious species, meaning it has separate hermaphrodite (male and female) and female parts. The female plants have a much harder time becoming pollinated, due to the limited number of birds (especially tūī and bellbirds), which are the main pollinators of F. excorticata. This species flowers from August to December and produces berries from December to March. Tree fuchsia can grow in riparian soil and can be utilised as a predecessor species for areas where conditions and soils are not the best. It likes moist soil with a canopy overhead for shade. Local birds such as tūī, bellbirds, kererū, and silvereyes feed on tree fuchsia. Tūī and kererū eat the flowers and fruit; other birds consume the nectar. Tree fuchsia can, and has in some locations, been pushed out of its habitat by plant competitors such as banana passionfruit and Buddleia. Mammalian threats, such as goats, have been known to forage on tree fuchsia, but they do not have as large an effect as possums. Possums put the tree at risk because they eat the fruit and seeds, and do this without stopping when seed production is low. Known as kōtukutuku in Māori, Fuchsia excorticata had many uses for the Māori people and early settlers of New Zealand. These uses included as a basic foodstuff, in jams, and use by Māori women in vapor baths after childbirth. Tannins in the bark were used as a natural agent in leather tanning. Fuchsia excorticata was also used to produce brightly coloured dyes.",Normal

"Thalys (French: ) was a brand name used for high-speed train services between Paris Gare du Nord via Brussels-South to either Amsterdam Centraal or to German cities in the Rhein-Ruhr, including Aachen, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Duisburg, Essen and Dortmund. Since 29 September 2023, the services continue to operate, but under the Eurostar name; sometimes referred to as Eurostar Red, based on the colour of the trains. Thalys was created out of a political ambition formalised in October 1987 to establish a network of international high-speed railway services between the cities of Paris, Brussels, Cologne and Amsterdam. The Thalys name was created in January 1995. The company procured a fleet of Alstom-built TGV trains to operate its services as they were viewed as the only existing rolling stock suitable to the task. On 4 June 1996, the first Thalys-branded train departed from Paris. Early services were more reliant on slower conventional lines as many of the intended new high-speed lines were still under construction. Service speeds would improve with the opening of Belgium's HSL 1 line in December 1997 and the Dutch HSL-Zuid in December 2009, alongside other infrastructure works. Thalys's busiest route was the Paris–Belgium corridor; various airlines, such as Air France and KLM, opted to discontinue directly competing flights with Thalys's high speed services. From 1996 to April 2022, the service was managed by Thalys International, which was 70% owned by the French national railway company SNCF and 30% owned by the Belgian national railway company NMBSSNCB. It was operated by THI Factory, which was 60% owned by SNCF and 40% owned by NMBSSNCB. Between 2007 and 2013, the German national railway company Deutsche Bahn had also held a 10% stake in the company. On 30 March 2015, Thalys was restructured as a conventional train operating company, becoming less reliant on SNCF and NMBSSNCB. During September 2019, a plan was announced to merge Thalys and the cross-Channel high-speed train operator Eurostar. Approval of the merger was issued by the European Commission on 28 March 2022. In February 2022, Thalys International was integrated into THI Factory, which in turn was acquired by the holding company Eurostar Group during the following month. From April 2022 to September 2023, Thalys services were operated by the Eurostar Group. Prior to the creation of Thalys, an express rail service had long been operated between the capital cities of Paris and Brussels, the earliest being run in 1924 in the form of the train service l'Étoile du Nord. By the 1970s, the conventional service connecting the two cities had a journey time of around two hours and 30 minutes. In the following decade, interest in an international high-speed train service along a similar route was gaining traction amongst various governments. During October 1987, the political decision to create a network of high-speed services between the cities of Paris, Brussels, Cologne, and Amsterdam was made in Brussels. However, in 1991, the Dutch parliament initially rejected the project; continued discussions led to an agreement being reached with Belgium for a route via Breda instead of Roosendaal. The building of the HSL-Zuid high speed line in the Netherlands was finally approved in 1996. Meanwhile, Germany decided against the construction of a new railway between Aachen and Cologne, instead opting to renovate the existing track between Duren and Cologne, which resulted in a top speed of 250 kilometres per hour along this section. On 28 January 1993, SNCF, SNCBNMBS, Nederlandse Spoorwegen and Deutsche Bundesbahn (which became part of Deutsche Bahn in 1994) signed an agreement to operate the axis on a joint basis. During January 1995, Westrail International was created by the French and Belgian national railways to operate the new international services. That same month, both the logo and brand of Thalys were also created; the word deliberately lacked any particular meaning, save for being pronounceable in the languages of all the countries served. It was decided to procure Alstom-built TGV trains, similar to those already used by SNCF on the French national railways, as these were the only suitable rolling stock available at the time. Another key decision was to launch the service in advance of many of the planned high speed lines, being initially reliant upon slower conventional lines until these were eventually completed; the existing international services that used conventional rolling stock were deliberately withdrawn in preparation for the running of Thalys trains in early June 1996. On 4 June 1996, the first Thalys-branded train departed Paris, this maiden journey took two hours and seven minutes to reach to Brussels, and four hours and 47 minutes to arrive in Amsterdam. Initially, Thalys services only operated four times per day to Amsterdam and Cologne, while a far greater volume were run between Paris and Belgium. While quite restricted early on, the number of Thalys services would be gradually expanded over time, as would the high speed network that supported it. During December 1997, the Belgian HSL 1 line, allowing 300kmh (186mph) and running from the French border to the outskirts of Brussels, was inaugurated. On 14 December 1997, the first Thalys train from Paris to Brussels ran on the HSL 1, reducing travel time to 1:25 hours. At the same time, service commenced to Cologne and Aachen in Germany, and Bruges, Charleroi, Ghent, Mons, Namur and Ostend in Belgium. On 19 December 1998, the Thalys Neige service started to the ski resorts of Tarentaise Valley and Bourg-Saint-Maurice. In May 1999, the new high-speed line serving Charles de Gaulle Airport opened, and Thalys started direct services from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport to Brussels, including codeshare agreements with Air France, American Airlines and Northwest Airlines. On 28 November 1999, Westrail International changed its name to Thalys International. In 2000, Thalys started a daily Service between Brussels and Geneva. With its Thalys Soleil (French for 'Thalys Sun'), it started offering direct connections to Provence, initially to Valence, and extended to Avignon and Marseille in 2002. Service between Brussels and Cologne was improved in December 2002 when trains began running on the new HSL 2 in Belgium. During 2003, Thalys services started to Brussels Airport and the Thalys Nuits d'Été service to Marne-la-Vallée. In 2007, Deutsche Bahn purchased a 10% shareholding, while SNCF reduced its stake to 62% and SNCB to 28%. Beginning on 14 June 2009, the journey between Brussels and Cologne was shortened by 19 minutes when the new high-speed line HSL 3 between Liège and Aachen opened using Deutsche Bahn's thrice-daily ICE trains running between Brussels and Frankfurt. While HSL 3 was completed during 2007, Thalys trains had not been initially equipped with the European Train Control System (ETCS) signaling equipment necessary to use the new line. Following the completion of installation and testing work, Thalys began operating on HSL 3 on 13 December 2009. For the same reasons, Thalys started operating on the HSL 4HSL-Zuid high-speed line between Antwerp and Amsterdam on 13 December 2009, two years after the line's construction. Since 29 August 2011, one return journey to Cologne has been extended to Essen Hauptbahnhof, and since 30 October 2011, one return journey to Brussels had been extended to Brussels National Airport. On 9 June 2013, Deutsche Bahn permanently ceased the sale of tickets for Thalys services, forcing affected travellers to purchase separate tickets. The company also opted to sell its 10 per cent shareholding in Thalys, marking a general parting of ways between the two operators. Since the winter 2013 schedule, Thalys has operated services stopping at Düsseldorf Airport station. On 12 April 2014, it launched a regular service between Lille Europe and Amsterdam Centraal. At the end of March 2015, Thalys dropped the Paris – Oostende and the Paris – Brussels – Mons – Charleroi – Namur – Liège routes; this withdrawal was reportedly due to a lack of funding from the Belgian government. On 30 March 2015, Thalys was restructured as a conventional train operating company, adopting the name THI Factory, and has since operated under its own train operator certificate. Prior to this date, the ownership of Thalys's 26 multi-voltage TGVs had been divided between the four national railway operators holding stakes in the company; they were transferred to the company at this point. These changes were promoted as making Thalys a truly independent company, reducing its interactions with both SNCF and SNCB; headquarters were established in Brussels, with a branch office in Paris. On 21 March 2016, services in Germany were extended to Dortmund. In March 2018, Thalys ceased all its operations from Lille-Europe, citing disappointing demand (despite lower-than-average ticket prices) and financial results. In September 2019, the shareholders of the cross-Channel high speed train operator Eurostar and Thalys introduced a plan to merge the two companies, named project Green Speed. Both companies already operate in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, with Eurostar also operating in the United Kingdom, and Thalys also operating in Germany, while SNCF already held a majority stake in both operators. The project was promoted as reducing costs and providing a more seamless experience to passengers via the use of a single ticketing system and loyalty program. During September 2020, the merger between Thalys and Eurostar International was confirmed, In October 2021, it was announced that, upon the completion of the merger, it was intended for all of Thalys's services to be rebranded as Eurostar. On 28 March 2022, the European Commission approved the merger. The rebranding of Thalys services commenced in the autumn of 2023, and is planned to be completed by early in 2024. All services of the Eurostar brand will carry a common Eurostar logo, but with the cross-channel trains retaining their dark blue livery, and Thalys's rolling stock retaining its deep red livery. In April 2022, THI Factory was acquired by a new holding company, Eurostar Group; its former shareholders received a corresponding stake in the new holding company. Beyond Brussels, the main cities Thalys trains reach are Antwerp, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Liège, Aachen and Cologne. Trains to these destinations run partly on dedicated high-speed tracks, and partly on conventional tracks shared with normal-speed trains. The high-speed lines used by Thalys are HSL 1 between Paris and Brussels, HSL 4HSL-Zuid between Antwerp and Amsterdam, and the HSL 2 and HSL 3 between Brussels and Aachen. For its seasonal operations within France, other high-speed lines are used. Journeys from Brussels (Brussels-South) to Paris (Gare du Nord) are normally 1 hour and 22 minutes, for a distance of approximately 300 kilometres (190mi). The peak service speed is 300kmh (186mph) while travelling a dedicated high-speed railway track, which is typically electrified at 25 kV AC by an overhead line. The ligne à grande vitesse (LGV) link with Charles de Gaulle Airport allowed Air France to withdraw its air service between Paris and Brussels; instead, Air France transfers connecting passengers onto Thalys trains. Thalys has been given the IATA designator 2H. This is used in conjunction with American Airlines and Delta Air Lines. American Airlines has a code-sharing agreement with Thalys for rail service from Charles de Gaulle airport to Brussels-South. The airline alliance SkyTeam also has a code-sharing agreement with Thalys for rail service connecting its hub Amsterdam Schiphol Airport with Antwerp-Centraal and Bruxelles MidiBrussel Zuid. Thalys and the Dutch flagcarrier KLM jointly collaborate on AirRail, an initiative to encourage passengers to travel by train to connect with KLM flights; this effort led to KLM reducing air services between Brussels and Amsterdam. Thalys targets a passenger market in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany. The percentage of income coming from different routes demonstrates on which routes the company is most used: 52% of customers are from the leisure market, while 48% are from the business market. A large segment of Thalys's total sales and income comes from the connection between Paris and Brussels. Unlike many national train companies, Thalys does not allow children below 12 years old to travel alone. Children onboard Thalys services must be accompanied and possess appropriate travel documents as required by the relevant national authorities pertaining to the journey being made. Since 24 August 2010, there has been a supplement of €7 to Thalys (as well as other international high-speed tickets) tickets bought at SNCBNMBS ticket offices at train stations (but not on tickets bought over the Internet). This is due to a reduction of a sales fee paid by Thalys and Eurostar to the Belgian rail company. The sales prices have evolved, by June 2019, the ""booking fee"" (as it is referred to as) had risen to €9. All figures in millions. Revenue in millions of euros. Thalys trains are wheelchair-accessible, with the assistance of the train staff. Bicycles are not allowed on Thalys unless disassembled or packed in a special wrap. Folding bikes are allowed. In February 2020, Thalys announced that its new first-and-last mile travel service 'My Driver by Thalys's enables passengers can choose between around 50 local taxi fleets to complete their rail journeys. Thalys operates station lounges in Brussels and Paris. Opened on 9 July 2015, the newest lounge in Paris' Gare du Nord (not to be confused with Brussels' Gare du Nord, where Thalys trains pass through without stopping), located on Rue de Dunkerque, offers travelers with a valid My Thalys World membership (Thalys's loyalty program) a variety of services, including free WiFi and a luggage storage service. For business travelers, a fully equipped meeting room is available for up to six people. Thalys uses two models of trains, both of which are part of the TGV (train à grande vitesse) family of high-speed trains built by Alstom in France. Official website",Normal
"Donald Marr Nelson (1888–1959) was an American business executive and public servant, serving as the executive vice president of Sears Roebuck before accepting the position of director of priorities of the United States Office of Production Management (1941–1942). In 1942 Nelson became chairman of the War Production Board (1942–1944) when it replaced the OPM. He later served for two years (1945–1947) as president of the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers. Nelson was born in Hannibal, Missouri, the son of a locomotive engineer. He went to the University of Missouri, graduating in 1911 with a degree in chemical engineering. In 1912 he took a job as a chemist with Sears, Roebuck and Company. There he steadily advanced, becoming vice-president in 1930 and being named executive vice president and vice chairman of the executive committee by 1939. It was Nelson's experience at Sears, buying more than 135,000 different products while gaining an unparalleled knowledge of American industry, that led President Franklin Roosevelt to give him several jobs overseeing production of war material for the United States and its allies in World War II. In May 1940, Roosevelt appointed Nelson to a post at the Treasury Department where he served as acting director of the procurement division, managing sales of raw materials to Britain and its allies for use in their fight against the Axis. During the second half of 1940, Axis successes and the possibility of American involvement in the spreading war heightened concerns about the nation's military readiness. With an eye to improving the efficiency of war production, in January, 1941 several agencies responsible for purchasing billions of dollars of war materials for the defense industry were reorganized into a central procurement agency, the Office of Production Management, with Nelson the director of priorities. As American war preparations continued to expand during 1941, new inefficiencies in the supply process were exposed, and in July a new agency, the Supply Priorities and Allocations Board (SPAB) was created to deal with them. Nelson was named its director. In January, 1942, following America's entry into the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt abolished both the OPM and the SPAB, replacing them with a new agency, the War Production Board. Once again, FDR asked Nelson to lead it. Nelson proved a poor leader who feuded with the Army and failed to make timely decisions. Nelson faced extensive criticism from the military during his tenure. Described by historian Doris Kearns Goodwin as ""habitually indecisive"", Nelson had difficulty sorting the conflicting requests from various agencies. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson regularly criticized Nelson for his ""inability to take charge"". He argued endlessly with Robert P. Patterson of the War Department. Patterson typically demanded that civilian needs be given lower priority because military supplies were essential to winning the war, and that argument usually prevailed. In February 1943, Roosevelt invited Bernard Baruch to replace Nelson as WPB head, but was persuaded to change his mind by advisor Harry Hopkins, and Nelson remained in the post. He was replaced by Julius Albert Krug, who served from August 1944 until the Board was dissolved. Nelson returned to private industry. He died of a stroke in 1959. His 1946 memoir Arsenal of Democracy is one of the major works on the U.S. industrial mobilization effort during World War II.",Normal

"The Messenger (Turkish: Ulak) is a 2007 Turkish drama film, written and directed by Çağan Irmak, which follows a man who travels from village to village to tell children stories about a messenger named İbrahim. The film, which was selected for film festivals in Istanbul, Adana and Antalya, went on general release across Turkey on January25,2008(2008-01-25) and is one of the highest grossing Turkish films of 2008. A mysterious traveller Zekeriya arrives at a village. He captivates much of the village's people by telling tales of a messenger on horseback named İbrahim. The village becomes divided on him, each one taking on various personalities from other stories. Today's Zaman reviewer Fatih Selvi says this, is the kind of film which, as you watch it, you'll start looking inside. It is as though, from the very beginning of the film to the end, you are wandering around in a fairy tale. But not just as an observer and a listener, rather, as though you are interacting with everything. It is a film that makes viewers ask themselves ""is this real, or just a story?"" over and over again, starting off somewhat like one of the stories your grandmothers and grandfathers might have told you when you were young. But as the film goes on, following the courier's specific tale, everything changes color suddenly. Perhaps Irmak is trying to tell a story from centuries of years ago with this film. Or perhaps this is a story from these days. But whatever the time frame, the message contained in the story is applicable to yesterday, today and even tomorrow. Maybe the film is an attempt to reach tomorrow using the language of yesterday. In any case, the actors are different but the roles are the same. The director underscores the necessity of people like İbrahim in today's world, with all its vulgarities.

"Ajita Chakraborty (1926 - 2015) was one of the first women psychiatrists in India. Chakraborty was born in Calcutta in the state of Bengal in 1926. She graduated from Scottish Church College in Calcutta in 1944, and in 1950 Chakraborty qualified as a doctor by graduating from Calcutta Medical College. She continued her medical education in the United Kingdom where she trained in psychiatry. In 1960 she went back to India, thereby becoming the first female psychiatrist in the country. Chakraborty was involved in the Indian Psychiatric Society, starting first with a position as general secretary and eventually elected as president in 1976. She was the first woman to serve as president of the society. She worked in the field of transcultural psychiatry. Her studies included the visual hallucinations of gods and goddess that she noted were particularly common in women. In 1991 she published an article titled Culture, colonialism, and psychiatry at the invitation of The Lancet. Following her death in 2015 her work was covered in a chapter by Mandira Sen and in a book on mental hospitals where Chakraborty described her experiences with the changing practice of psychiatry in India over the course of her career. The Bombay Psychiatric Society awarded her with a lifetime achievement award.",Normal

"Thomas Pope (died 1603), also credited as Thomas Poope in the First Folio, was an Elizabethan actor, a member of the Lord Chamberlain's Men and a colleague of William Shakespeare. Pope was a ""comedian and acrobat."" Nothing is known of Pope's early life. He was one of the English players who toured Denmark and Saxony in 1586–87, along with George Bryan, another future Chamberlain's man. He was in the production of The Seven Deadly Sins c. 1591, which was performed by a combination of personnel from Lord Strange's Men and the Admiral's Men, and which starred Edward Alleyn and included Bryan, Richard Burbage, Augustine Phillips, Richard Cowley, and John Sinklo, all soon-to-be Lord Chamberlain's Men. Pope toured with Lord Strange's Men under Edward Alleyn in 1593, with most of the same personnel. Pope was most likely an original member of the Lord Chamberlain's Men at their re-constitution in 1594, along with Shakespeare, Burbage, and the others. He was a figure of some significance in the early phase of the company's history, in that he and John Heminges were the payees for their Court performances — a responsibility that would have been given only to trusted members. Though no information has survived on his specific roles, it is thought that his physique and style most suited the comic character of stout, braggartly cowards, such as Falstaff and Sir Toby Belch, although he is also conjectured to have performed in dramatic roles, such as Mercutio and Shylock. He was also cast in the two Ben Jonson plays acted by the company in the late 1590s, Every Man in His Humour (1598) and Every Man Out of His Humour (1599). In 1599 he also became one of the original sharers in the new Globe Theatre. He was no longer part of the company when they became the King's Men in 1603; he might have been retired by then, and in fact died in that year. Like some other actors and members of his troupe (Shakespeare; Phillips), Pope lived in Southwark, near the theatres; he is thought to have remained unmarried. Pope's last will and testament was dated 22 July 1603 (and probated on 13 February 1604). He left legacies to two other actors, one of whom was Robert Gough, an actor with the Lord Chamberlain's Men who continued with the King's Men after 1603. The other was a John Edmans, or Edmonds. Pope left Gough and Edmans ""all my wearing apparel, and all my arms, to be equally divided between them."" Pope also left his share in the Globe, and a share in the Curtain Theatre, to a Mary Clark; in 1612 the Globe share was owned by a John and Mary Edmans — she, presumably, being the former Mary Clark. The fact that Pope owned a share in the Curtain Theatre, where the Lord Chamberlain's Men had acted in the 1597–99 era, is significant for an understanding of an important facet of the development of English Renaissance theatre.

"Ceilândia (Portuguese pronunciation: ) is an administrative region in the Federal District in Brazil. It is bordered by Brazlândia to the north, Taguatinga to the east, and Samambaia and Sol NascentePor do Sol to the south. With about 398,374 inhabitants, it is the administrative region of largest population in the Federal District. Ceilândia was created as a city on 27 March 1971 by Hélio Prates da Silveira, originally created as the ""CEI"" (Portuguese: Campanha de Erradicação de Invasões: Invasions Eradication Campaign) in 1969, a campaign to combat irregular settlements near Brasília. Ceilândia was originally created by the government in the 1970s as a campaign by then governor Hélio Prates da Silveira to keep people from moving into Brasília and setting up invasions. The root of the name Ceilândia is ""CEI"" (Portuguese: Campanha de Erradicação de Invasões: Invasions Eradication Campaign). The campaign was created by Hélio Prates da Silveira to prevent people from invading Brasilia, and to combat irregular settlements in the region. In 1969, after only nine years of existence, Brasília already had 79,128 people living in irregular occupations, out of a population of 500 thousand inhabitants in all the Federal District. In that year a seminar took place in Brasília concerning social problems of the Federal District. Invasion dwellers were the most serious problem. 17619 lots were laid out and in 1970 the first construction began. In nine months the transfer of the families was concluded with the streets opening. The population had no water, no public lighting, no public transport and struggled against dust, mud and flash floods. Today Ceilândia is the largest electoral college of the Federal District and the most populous city, with more inhabitants than the Brasília. It occupies a total of 91 residential squares laid out like Brasília, intercalated by areas for local commerce, churches and schools. There are also some special areas that are set aside to provide community services. An active commercial center, it has 4,500 commercial establishments and 1,600 small industries. The economically active population is more than 160,000 people. Two important locals of Ceilandia are the Caixa d'Água (Water Tower), and the Casa do Cantador (House of the Singer), a cultural center dedicated to the artists of Northeast Brazil. The building was designed by Oscar Niemeyer and completed in 1986. Ceilândia is considered the second largest ""Northeastern city"" outside the Brazilian Northeast Region (the first one is São Paulo). About 70% of the population is of Northeastern origin. The presence of the Northeast culture can be seen in the number of open-air fairs (13 in all). The fairs (feiras-livres) are also an alternative for the workers that did not find space in the economy of the Federal District. In most of them, fruits, foods, clothes and footwear are commercialized. The Fair of the Producer (Feira do Produtor e Atacadista de Ceilândia) sells wholesale and supplies almost 50% of the Federal District. The Central Fair (Feira Permanente de Ceilândia), is the largest of all. It occupies an area of seven thousand square meters and sells household articles, tools, electric appliances, fruits, vegetables, and poultry. It is located next to the Caixa d'Água (Water Tower) - the symbol of Ceilândia. Another fair is the Feira do Rolo. Ceilândia is served by several highways connecting it to Brasília Ceilândia is served by the following Federal District Metro stations:",Normal
"AlgaeBase is a global species database of information on all groups of algae, both marine and freshwater, as well as sea-grass. AlgaeBase began in March 1996, founded by Michael Guiry. By 2005, the database contained about 65,000 names. In 2013, AlgaeBase and the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ) signed an end-user license agreement regarding the Electronic Intellectual Property of AlgaeBase. This allows the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) to include taxonomic names of algae in WoRMS, thereby allowing WoRMS, as part of the Aphia database, to make its overview of all described marine species more complete. Synchronisation of the AlgaeBase data with Aphia and WoRMS was undertaken manually until March 2015, but this was very time-consuming, so an online application was developed to semi-automate the synchronisation, launching in 2015 in conjunction with Michael Guiry and the chief programmer of AlgaeBase, Pier Kuipers. After a long phase of further development and testing, the AlgaeBase harvester tool was implemented by the WoRMS data management team in early 2019. Since then, newly-added species in AlgaeBase are added to Aphia and, if marine, to WoRMS as well. The database is hosted at the National University of Ireland's Ryan Institute, in Galway. It includes about all types of algae, as well as one group of flowering plants, the sea-grasses. Information about each species' taxonomy, nomenclature and distribution is included, and the algae covered include terrestrial as well as marine and freshwater species, such as seaweeds, phytoplankton, and freshwater algae. As of 2019 marine species have the best coverage, and sea-grass is included, although it is a flowering plant rather than an alga. As of 2014 there were nearly 17,000 images, and the database was being used by 2,000–3,000 individual visitors each day. As of 2023, there were about 170,000 species and infraspecies in AlgaeBase. The compilation of the data was funded by the Irish Government Department of Education and Science's Programme for Research in Third-level Institutions (PRTLI) 2, 3 and 4 programmes, to the Ryan Institute and the Environmental Change Institute, as well as by Atlantic Philanthropies, and the European Union. The synchronisation between AlgaeBase and Aphia was possible through support of the LifeWatch Species Information Backbone. LifeWatch, the E-Science European Infrastructure for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research, is a distributed virtual laboratory, which is used for different aspects of biodiversity research. As of 2022 the main sponsors of the database are the Phycological Society of America, the British Phycological Society, the International Phycological Society, and the Korean Phycological Society. Programming is carried out by Pier Kuipers and Caoilte Guiry, and Michael Guiry. Jonathan Guthrie was responsible for programming much of earlier versions.",Normal

"Boops boops (ˈboʊ.ɒps; from Ancient Greek βόωψ, literally 'ox-eyed'), commonly called the bogue, is a species of seabream native to the eastern Atlantic. In the fourth century BCE, Boops boops was documented by Aristotle as box (Greek βῶξ) in his Historia Animalium. In the early third century CE, Athenaeus, in his Deipnosophistae, also called the fish box and suggested that the name came from the sound that the fish makes (Greek βοή, ""roar""). The name boops (Greek βόωψ, ""ox-eyed"") is mentioned due to the fish’s large eyes. The first scientific description comes from Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of Systema Naturae as Sparus boops. It was later reclassified under the genus Boops. The species is found off the coasts of Europe, Africa, the Azores and the Canary Islands, from Norway to Angola, and in the Mediterranean and Black Seas. It avoids brackish waters such as the Baltic Sea. A demersal and semi-pelagic feeder, it can generally be found at a depth of 100m (330ft), and infrequently down to 350m (1,150ft). It consumes seaweed, crustaceans, and some plankton, in schools that rise to the surface at night. Individuals can reach 36cm (14in), but average 20cm (7.9in). Sex determination in the bogue is unclear. It has variously been described as a rudimentary intersex organism, with a few intersex individuals, or a protogynous intersex, with individuals starting out life as females, and some becoming male later on. The species is commercially fished, with 37,830 tonnes taken in 2008. European Commission standards include three size categories for Boops boops, from size 3 which is between 32 and 70 fish per kilogram, to size 1 which is no more than 5 fish per kilogram. When cleaned and pan fried, broiled or baked fresh, they are good tasting, but when stored their gut flora soon spread unpleasant flavors to their flesh. Much of the catch is used for fishmeal or tuna fishing bait. Boops boops has been used as an indicator of microplastic pollution in the Mediterranean sea. The bogue is host to a wide variety of parasites, ranging from metazoans such as monogenean flatworms (e.g. Microcotyle isyebi and Cyclocotyla bellones) acanthocephalan spiny-headed worms, nematode roundworms, isopod and copepod crustaceans and myxozoan cnidarians to the unicellular dinoflagellate Ichthyodinium chabelardi, a parasite lethal to eggs developing in ovaries. At least 67 metazoan parasite species have been reported from the species. In the aftermath of the 2002 Prestige oil spill, the community of parasitic species inhabiting bogue caught off the coast of Spain was noticeably altered.",Normal
"Economics of participation is an umbrella term spanning the economic analysis of worker cooperatives, labor-managed firms, profit sharing, gain sharing, employee ownership, employee stock ownership plans, works councils, codetermination, and other mechanisms which employees use to participate in their firm's decision making and financial results. A historical analysis of worker participation traces its development from informal profit sharing in U.S. factories, to flexible remuneration in the aftermath of Industrial Revolution and to staff democracy's application for earning stability in economic downturns during the 21st Century. The economic analysis of these participatory tools reveals their benefits and limitations for individuals, businesses and the wider economy. As a result of worker participation, employees gain skills, morale and motivation that improve business output, productivity and profitability. Spill-on effects into the wider economy can anchor human and financial capital in domestic industries, which have the potential to increase aggregate demand. However, negative implications of staff democracy encompass the free-rider effect and volatile incomes, which may reduce morale and motivation at an organisational level. Further, the long-run success of worker democracy is economically equivocal, and may prove an Pareto inefficient use of economic resources. Economics of participation is fundamentally derived from the concept of an employee's involvement in, and contribution to, the operational and managerial functions of their workplace. This foundational concept dates to as early as 1733, when President Benjamin Franklin applied a form of employee ownership to the establishment of print shops during the founding of the United States. In exchange for a third of each shop's profits, Franklin covered the costs of each shop's upfront capital in addition to a third of operating expenses. After six years, he transferred the stores' ownership to various journeymen, ""most of  did well"" and who were able to ""go on working for themselves"" successfully, among the first of all employee-owners. Then, during the 1970s, the USA's first profit sharing plan was initiated into Pensylvanian glassworks factories by Secretary of the Treasurer Albert Gallatin, where a fixed proportion of company profits were redistributed to employees as bonuses for exceeding output targets. Economics of participation emerged more formally during the USA's shift towards an industrial economy. The directors of large companies, for example Procter & Gamble and Sears & Roebuck, wanted to provide their staff with income during retirement, as financial support during employees' post-working lives. To achieve this without deteriorating firm profitability, these directors decided to award employees ownership in exchange for production effort while still employed: those who achieved set targets were allocated company stock upon retirement. In 1956, the first employee stock ownership plan was created by Louis O. Kelso, a lawyer and economist from San Francisco, to transfer ownership of Peninsula Newspapers, Inc. from two elderly founders to the company's employees. During the late nineteenth century, General Foods and Pillsbury were among the first companies to formally initiate profit-sharing bonuses: select percentages of firm profits were reallocated to staff when they exceeded sales targets. Later, in 1916, Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago created the first profit-sharing pension plan, drawing upon the example set by Proctor & Gamble to ensure loyal, motivated staff received financial aid during retirement. Resultantly, the concept of profit-sharing was more widely used to the point where, during the Second World War, select employers applied it to provide necessary financial aid to staff without raising wages numerically. The notion that profit-sharing balances employees' financial security with their firm's need for increased profitability thus emerged. Worker cooperatives, another key tool used for economics of participation, gained momentum as part of the labour movement. During the Industrial Revolution, once-workers more frequently began to assume managerial and directorial roles as a ""critical reaction to industrial capitalism and the excesses of the Industrial Revolution."" Worker cooperatives emerged rapidly, to combat ""insecurities of wage labour"" by establishing and operating employee-owned firms that provided fair wages, most prominently in the cotton mills of New Lanark, Scotland. Dr William King, a pioneer in the field of economics of participation, founded a monthly periodical titled The Co-operator in 1828, which many sourced for advice on inaugurating their own worker cooperative. While traditional business uses of the economics of participation primarily aimed to increase firm profitability, modern applications are often justified by their capacity to improved corporate culture, morale and staff satisfaction. Companies such as Huawei and Publix Super Markets have implemented a combination of employee ownership and profit-sharing plans as tools for employee participation, doing so to more closely align their staff with the goals, objectives and policies of their corporate vision rather than boost financial return. For instance, the aggregate yearly value of Huawei's employee remuneration, including profit-sharing plans and stock ownership, is 2.8 times the firm's annual net profit. More recently, economics of participation tools, particularly profit sharing and employee ownership, have been applied as strategic responses to pandemic-induced economic downturn. The table below shows results from a 2021 study comparing the effects of COVID-19 on employee-owned and non-employee-owned firms: significant differences in total employment, pay cuts and hour cuts were observed. Owing to their benefits for worker motivation, loyalty, career security and income stability, many economists predict tools for economics of participation are likely to become more frequent responses to downswings in economic activity. By allowing employees to participate in organisational decision-making, businesses reinforce a corporate culture framed around self-ownership, accountability, shared values and secure employment. In turn, this culture generates financial and non-financial benefits for staff, firm profitability and the wider economy. The application of economics of participation to business decision making more strongly identifies individual staff members with the values and culture of their workplace. The resulting increase in motivational outcomes stimulates gains to productivity], which improve total output, revenues and growth. An early study introducing employee-ownership into forty-five firms recorded a 3.84 percentage point increase in employment growth and a 3.51 percentage point increase in sales growth after this tool for economics of participation was implemented. Subsequent studies have confirmed the positive effects of worker participation on business output, concluding that this practice generally stimulates ""increased productivity reinforced by increased participation"". Moreover, tools such as profit-sharing or employee stock ownership may reduce shirking behaviours in staff as it is in workers’ best interest to maximise their output for increased pay. Hence, businesses may be able to reduce their supervision personnel and the expenses associated with these staff members’ wages. In addition, the Substitution argument is enabled by economics of participation, whereby firms use tools such as profit-sharing or ESOPs to substitute fixed pay (i.e. wages and salaries) for variable remuneration. By doing so, a business's cost of human capital is more closely aligned with its ability to award financial compensation: the firm is thus provided with greater flexibility to adjust wages according to prevailing economic conditions. For example, a decrease in profit-shared wages during an economic recession may mitigate the impact of reduced output and revenues on business profitability, enabling firms to retain workers at a lower cost rather than retrenching them. As such, economics of participation can improve job security for staff, while guarding firm profits against unforeseen economic misfortune. Tools for economics of participation often aim to increase business output and productivity. As these increased levels of output are directly correlated to higher profit portions for staff, employees also receive the benefit of voluntarily increasing their remuneration so that efficiency wages may be awarded. These above-market wages are made financially feasible by the gains derived from increased productivity, whereby a firm's initial investment into its human capital enables economic rent to be shared, via profit-sharing mechanisms or wage redistribution. Furthermore, when an increased number of employees adopt managerial roles within a firm or a worker cooperative, a flatter organisational structure arises. Hence, staff are allowed to participate ""at the highest level"" through member-driven participation, for example through open-led meetings and consensus decision-making. Often, this is facilitated through training in public speaking and small-group debate opportunities, which develop staff members' communication abilities and equip them with skills vital to labour participation. By fulfilling these managerial functions, workers develop transferrable soft skills in communication and responsibility that increase chances of future employment and career development. Moreover, when tools to encourage employee engagement are combined with strong labour market regulation, the welfare of employees may increase. For instance, if employee-owners collectively decide to implement policies for flexitime or telecommuting, worker satisfaction and productivity are likely to improve, and aforementioned efficiency wages may further increase. Methods to encourage economics of participation are heavily reliant on the concept of economic democracy, and thereby advocate for the transfer of decision-making power from managers and directors to public stakeholders, among which are workers. In the first instance, the implementation of employee ownership can privatise a firm and encourage economic reform, which encourages a more equal distribution of resources and economic growth. The economics of participation can also be applied on a microeconomic scale: for example, a centrally planned economy which includes state-owned factors of production can distribute revenue made from the use of each resource to workers involved in its production. This makeshift use of 'profit sharing' enables manual labourers retain their capitalistic motivations to produce efficiently, while the state maintains a majority share of ownership over the factors of production. In addition, the economics of employee ownership recognise its ability to ""anchor capital"", or fix resources in local production and development. Resultantly, domestic employment opportunities are increased as jobs are maintained and added, which increase consumer incomes ( Y ) {displaystyle (Y)} . As levels of income increase, consumers gain greater confidence and consumption ( C ) {displaystyle (C)} rises, finally contributing to an increase in aggregate demand A D = C + I + G + ( X − M ) {displaystyle AD=C+I+G+(X-M)} . Additionally, economic analysis of worker participation suggests mechanisms such as profit sharing and employee ownership can ""share wealth more broadly and increase the mutuality of interests"" for both employees and employers, particularly when the former are of low socioeconomic status. While remuneration in the form of income successfully satisfies short-term consumptive needs, wealth assets are more effective in granting owners access to additional asset-producing opportunities, which can in turn augment quality of life, income security and financial wellbeing overall. For example, after a 2015 study introduced employee ownership into the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, the value of employee owners' ""ESOP account after 20 years of employment  more than twice the average of a similar employee with only a 401k plan"", despite over 50% of employee owners not having a college or associate degree. Hence, employee participation may be seen to improve the long-term asset wealth of staff, and therefore contribute to an increase in financial quality of life for society overall. The economics of participation also acknowledge the shortcomings of employees' involvement in the decision-making and financial results of their firm. Scholars including Gregory Dow, David Ellerman and James Meade recognise that the labour-managed firm, tools for profit sharing and mechanisms for employee ownership may not be Pareto efficient, and are unfeasible for certain economies where market imperfections exist. Many obstacles impede a firm's easy implementation of worker democracy, and its results may not always be purely positive. Corporate morale is not always improved by employee participation: for instance, if a company's share price stagnates or declines after an ESOP is inaugurated, employees may feel as if their efforts are unrewarded. As their remuneration (i.e. a dividend) is directly impacted by share price, company-wide morale may worsen and levels of staff turnover may increase. Prolonged decreases in share performance may also lead to covert and overt industrial actions, which create a toxic corporate culture and accrue negative publicity for the firm itself. In addition, ESOPs implemented via share option plans may dilute company ownership. Thus, as more shares are issued each employee owns a smaller proportion of their firm, which may detract from the sense of ownership required for worker democracy to function effectively. Moreover, significant expenses are incurred while the concept of employee participation is introduced into a firm, and productivity may be lost during the process of familiarising staff with its protocols. An increase in such expenses, often considerable in magnitude, can severely and negatively affect a business's profit performance. Mechanisms such as profit sharing and employee ownership do not directly increase corporate capital or business profitability. Instead, they rely on the indirect effects of worker democracy to improve financial performance; for example through a reduction in fixed wages, gradual productivity gains and the elimination of supervision personnel. These indirect gains to a firm's profits are not always realised, which may worsen the business's financial position. As the profit-enhancing effects of employee participation are not guaranteed nor immediate, capital is often required from external investors and venture capitalists, who may desire decision-making power which has the potential to undermine the very concept upon which the labour-managed firm is predicated. As aforementioned, worker participation is often remunerated through non-fixed wages, for example profit-shared income or dividends paid to employee-owners. These forms of income are volatile, fluctuating alongside the economic cycle, company performance and the forces of supply and demand. Hence, worker income stability is jeopardised and remuneration may be significantly lower than a formal salary if economic conditions dampen or a firm's profit performance plateaus at a low point. In a particular focus group, 96% of employees opposed the complete substitution of wages and salaries for profit-shared remuneration, with a further 42% emphasising the ""disappointment or bitterness"" encountered when profit performance, and thus staff pay, decreased. As financial reward is a key motivator for many employees, a decrease in monetary remuneration may, in turn, reduce staff satisfaction, morale and motivation; ultimately lessening the productivity outputted by the firm. In addition, a variation of the economic argument denoted the ""free-rider effect"" also pertains to worker participation; a market failure whereby those who receive economic rewards from labour under-participate, or do not contribute equally to collaboratively designed tasks. Though a firm may be controlled by multiple employee-owners, or many staff receive profit-shared rewards, it is likely that they do not all contribute equally to the business's activities. Therefore, the distribution of income may be affected by the aforementioned free-rider problem. If noticed by staff, this effect may negatively impact staff morale and demotivate workers from increasing productivity. The successful introduction of worker participation into a business is challenging: as aforementioned, external finance, significant time and lost productivity are all expenses involved in the establishment of profit sharing tools, ESOPs or worker cooperatives. In the longer-term, however, very few tools for economic democracy survive, rendering their resource usage inefficient. The 'Degeneration Thesis' presented by Cornforth argues that firms operating upon the principles of worker democracy inevitably degenerate into more traditional capitalist structures, as a result of an economic variation of Michels's ""iron law of oligarchy"". When freely competitive markets confront an employee-owned firm, technical expertise, access to information about competitors' products and taller management structures are required to remain operative and profitable. Often, worker cooperatives and firms boasting staff democracy fail to access these resources, and so ""degenerate"" into traditionally-structured businesses. This process is resource inefficient, as time, capital and productivity is lost in the degeneration of an employee-owned firm, which reduces the total output available for consumption by society. The economics of participation have been developed by the contributions of numerous scholars and organisations. In particular, the work of Gregory Dow, David Ellerman, Derek C. Jones, Takao Kato, James Meade and Jaroslav Vanek has been significant in advancing the econometric, microeconomic and macroeconomic analysis of labour-managed firms, worker cooperatives, profit-sharing tools and other mechanisms for employee participation. In addition, the economics of participation are widely published, analysed and debated in the Journal of Participation and Employee Ownership, Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, Economic and Industrial Democracy and Journal of Comparative Economics. The International Association for the Economics of Participation is also significant in the promulgation of knowledge regarding this applied economic science.",Normal
"The Matrix was a nightclub in San Francisco from 1965 to 1972 and was one of the keys to what eventually became known as the ""San Francisco Sound"" in rock music. Located at 3138 Fillmore Street, in a 100-capacity beer-and-pizza shop, The Matrix opened 13 August 1965, showcasing Jefferson Airplane, which singer Marty Balin had put together as the club's ""house band"". Balin had persuaded three limited partners to put up $3,000 apiece to finance the club's opening, giving them 75 percent ownership, while he retained 25 percent for creating and managing it. Jefferson Airplane rose rapidly to local prominence during late 1965 and early 1966 with their performances at The Matrix, and it was there that they were first seen by noted music critic Ralph J. Gleason, who became an early champion of the group. The Matrix was a favorite haunt of gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson in the late 1960s – it was mentioned briefly in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas during a flashback scene. Thompson was a contributing editor for Rolling Stone magazine (founded in 1967 in San Francisco). The Matrix was an important place in the formative years of the San Francisco rock music scene, featuring not only rock bands, but several blues artists and blues bands, with an occasional jazz artist thrown in. Besides Jefferson Airplane, many other well-known bands and musicians performed there: Created and operated by musicians, the Matrix was popular with local and visiting musicians. On their off nights, many would go there to hear other groups they knew or just to visit. Management would waive the cover charge for prominent musicians who entered the club as customers. In the early years of The Matrix, there was a huge mural of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse on the left wall near the rear; rumor was that the members of Jefferson Airplane had painted it before the club first opened. Another wall was adorned with hieroglyphics. The club's lighting was very subdued everywhere but on its small stage. The club itself was very small; its max occupancy was only around 120 people. The entrance was recessed about two feet and was left of center on the windowless wall seen from the street, and there was a cabinet outside to the door's right where upcoming bands were listed and handbills were posted. Inside, near the entrance, there was a bar (beer and wine license only) on the front left. The interior was about 50 by 80 feet. The ceiling at the front third of the club was about ten feet high, but farther back, it went up to about 18 feet. The right front area had chairs and most of the cocktail tables, while the center of the room to the rear was a dance floor. The stage was a step above the floor on the right side, center to rear. A small sound booth occupied the center of the left wall, and a few cocktail tables were at the left rear in front of the mural. The rear wall had a window opening for the small galley used to prepare food. Sometime in 1966 or 1967, Marty Balin sold his share of the club to Peter Abram and Gary Jackson, two of the original partners; they bought out the remaining partner. Abram actively managed the club room and made bookings while also recording those musicians he knew and liked. Jackson took care of accounting and general business matters. For a brief period toward the end of 1966, Bill Ehlert, better known as the ""Jolly Blue Giant"" or simply ""Jolly"", owner of the Jabberwock in Berkeley, took over running The Matrix. This brought a distinct change to the booking policy whereby Jabberwock favorites Country Joe and the Fish, the New Age and Blackburn & Snow performed. Another change was seen in the advertising of shows, with Jabberwock house artist Tom Weller producing some classic posters and handbills. In 1968, after finally getting all the necessary releases, The Matrix's owners sold to Columbia Records some tapes of live sets from 1966 by The Great Society (the band Grace Slick belonged to before replacing Signe Anderson in Jefferson Airplane). Edits of those tapes (including the first commercial recordings of ""White Rabbit"" and ""Somebody to Love"") eventually became two LPs, Conspicuous Only in Its Absence and How It Was (promoted as by ""Grace Slick & The Great Society""). Over 20 years later, identical combinations of the two albums were re-released under different names as CDs by two different labels, because of separate licensing agreements in the US and the United Kingdom. Released by ABC Dunhill Records in 1969, the album Early Steppenwolf was material recorded live at The Matrix, purportedly on May 14, 1967, more than a year before the remodeling. However, the recordings were actually made when Steppenwolf was still called The Sparrow and were taped between May 9 and May 11, 1967 or between May 19 and 21. On May 14, the Sopwith Camel were playing the last day of a three-day set at The Matrix and The Sparrow did not appear. First released in the UK in 1984 by Edsel Records (a Demon Music Group label), Cheaper Thrills contains the best tracks from several Big Brother gigs at The Matrix before the band was well known. Like with many of the Matrix tapes, the actual recording dates have been lost over time. What is known is that the recordings were made in 1966 and 1967. The earnings from the Great Society tapes enabled a major remodeling of The Matrix, including a professional mixing booth and two higher quality tape decks, as well as major improvements to the sound and lighting systems. As part of its contract, Columbia Records also created a custom mixing board for the club, hoping for additional tapes of future live performances. The entrance was moved to the far right of the street wall and the ceiling was opened up to its full 18-foot height for the entire room. Just to the left of the entrance, against the street wall, was the new mixing booth, with its large, doubled-glass windows facing the main room. The stage was moved to the center of the left wall and was two feet above the dance floor, measuring 12 by 8 feet (instead of the 10 x 18 dimensions of the original stage). Large speaker systems were mounted near the ceiling in the left front and left rear corners. A new stage lighting system hung from the ceiling just in front of the stage. The Matrix continued to showcase local and visiting bands for a few more years. It was always a hangout for local musicians, famous or otherwise, both because of its history and because of the owners' respect for serious musicians. The club closed in 1972; although briefly reopening at a new location (412 Broadway, previously ""Mr D's"") in the fall of 1973. When The Matrix closed, a nearby bar, Pierce Street Annex, leased the space and moved in, remodeling once again, and turned it into a nightclub with only a DJ and no live music. After the Pierce Street Annex closed, then-Mayor Gavin Newsom's company, PlumpJack Group, took over in 2000 and renamed the space The MatrixFillmore. Live music was incorporated into the venue during the first few years; however, this layout was not a viable venue for live music and the program was dropped. The MatrixFillmore was one of the first ultra lounges in San Francisco. In 2017, the club name was changed back to The Matrix, described as a casual neighborhood bar with DJs and dancing on weekends. In 2018, The Matrix was remodeled and renamed the White Rabbit.",Normal

"The Newtown Mission Uniting Church is a heritage-listed Uniting church at 280a King Street, Newtown, City of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It was designed by George Allen Mansfield and built in 1859 by Thomas Abbott. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The first Methodist services were held in brick cottages at the corner of King and Eliza Sts from about 1840. In 1847 the church decided to build a chapel, and in 1849 land was purchased at the corner of King St and Erskineville Rd, with the chapel completed by 1850. The current church was constructed in 1859 as Newtown Methodist Church on a new site to accommodate the growing Methodist population in the Newtown area during the period of rapid expansion. The western gallery was erected in 1864. The interior was extensively altered in 1875. The eastern stained glass windows were added in 1882. The organ loft was added in 1910. Further renovations took place in 1923 and 1940. It adopted its current name in 1977 following the Methodist Church's amalgamation into the new Uniting Church of Australia. It is a two-storey Victorian Gothic style church constructed of face brickwork on sandstone base with stone dressings, buttresses and gable roof. The building is symmetrical, with triple gothic arched leadlight windows with stone tracery above panelled doors at ground-floor level. Remnant elements of cast-iron palisade fencing and gates with sandstone gateposts survive. The church and its pipe organ were listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999, having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Uniting Church, formerly the Wesleyan Chapel, has important associations for Australian Wesleyan Methodists in that its origins were determined by the ideas promulgated by Frederick J. Jobson, secretary of the Wesleyan Methodist Conference in 1842. Out of the deliberations of the conference came the decision to hold a competition for a ""Model Church"" It was the winning design that formed the basis for this building, albeit modified by George Mansfield. The organ was designed by a renowned firm of organ makers and has been a part of the church since 1878. The modifications made to it in 1910 were carried out by a prominent Australian firm. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics andor a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. It was the first example of the ""Model Plan"" church to be erected in Australia and has been described as the ""Mother Church of Australian Victorian Methodism"". In view of its antecedent it can be said to be of international style, with its adaptation to Australian requirements, first by Mansfield and later by Rowe, being of particular significance. Technically the organ was of a very advanced design and high standard of workmanship. The modifications made to it in 1910 were done with a similar standard of technical excellence and with respect for its provenance. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It is significant for its 130 years of community relationship both of a religious and more recently of a secular nature. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The church is rare in that only two examples at Mudgee and Parramatta are thought to have survived. The organ is rare in that only two other such organs are thought to exist in the state, and, apart from its early modifications in the early 20th century, it has not been altered since.

"Najib Razak BN Najib Razak BN General elections were held in Malaysia on Sunday, 5 May 2013. Voting took place in all 222 parliamentary constituencies, each electing one MP to the Dewan Rakyat, the dominant house of Parliament. State elections also took place in 505 state constituencies in 12 of the 13 states (excluding Sarawak) on the same day. The elections were the first since Najib Razak became Prime Minister in 2009. The unofficial opposition Pakatan Rakyat coalition led by Anwar Ibrahim received a majority of the vote, with its three member parties collectively receiving 50.9% of the vote. However, they won only 89 of the 222 seats. The incumbent governing alliance, Barisan Nasional, received 47.4% of the vote and won 133 seats, giving Najib a second term in office. This was the best performance shown by the opposition against the Barisan Nasional and the first time Barisan Nasional had received less than half the popular vote. Because Barisan Nasional had won a majority despite receiving fewer votes than the opposition, the elections were followed by protests and accusations of gerrymandering. The Malaysian Parliament was dissolved on 3 April 2013 by Tuanku Abdul Halim, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on the advice of the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Najib Tun Razak. The Prime Minister made a televised statement announcing the dissolution of the 12th Parliament at 11:30am local time the same day. Following the dissolution of Parliament, a general election was required to be held within 60 days, between 3 April and 2 June 2013, with the date to be decided by the Election Commission. On 10 April 2013, the Election Commission of Malaysia announced that nominations for election candidates would be held on 20 April, with the general election set for 5 May. The early voting date of 30 April was also announced by the Election Commission. Official campaigning began on 20 April, which allowed for a 15-day campaigning period. Postal voting for eligible overseas Malaysians was announced to happen on 28 April 2013. Malaysian representative offices would open on that day for this purpose from 9am to 6pm local time. Offices in London and Melbourne would close at 8pm instead, for the number of postal voters registered in those cities exceeded 1,000. In accordance with Malaysian law, the parliament as well as the legislative assemblies of each state (Dewan Undangan Negeri) would automatically dissolve on the fifth anniversary of the first sitting, and elections must be held within sixty days of the dissolution, unless dissolved prior to that date by their respective Heads of State on the advice of their Heads of Government. On 28 March 2013, the Negeri Sembilan Legislative Assembly became the first state assembly to dissolve automatically in Malaysian history. The state government would remain in place as a caretaker government and assembly members' constituency offices would remain open to serve the constituencies' needs. Following the dissolution of the Federal Parliament, state assemblies that had yet to be dissolved announced their dissolution in quick succession. Below are the dates of which the legislative assemblies of each state were dissolved: The Sarawak State Legislative Assembly was not dissolved as the last election had been held in 2011 and the term of the state assembly was due to end in 2016. Only parliamentary elections were held there. The 222 members of the Dewan Rakyat, the dominant house of Parliament, were elected in single-member constituencies using first-past-the-post voting. In the 2013 general election, 11.05 million people voted which was approximately 85 percent of registered voters in total, and it was the highest rate that Malaysia had ever gotten in their electoral history. Malaysia does not practice compulsory voting and automatic voter registration. Although the age of majority in the country is 18, the voting age is 21. The election was conducted by the Election Commission of Malaysia. Malaysia is one of the most ethnically diverse countries, with a majority Malay population in addition to Chinese and Indian minorities, so the political parties are also diverse. Parties engage ethnic divisions, and conflicts over power play out between political parties that represent specific ethnic groups. According to the author Lim Hong Hai, writing in 2002, ""over 80 per cent of Malaysia's population of over 23 million is found in Peninsular Malaysia, where the Malays form the largest ethnic group followed by the Chinese and Indians. All these ethnic groups are minorities in Sabah and Sarawak, where native ethnic groups other than the Malays make up about 60 per cent and 50 per cent of the population, respectively"". The Federation of Malaya was composed of 11 states in the Malay Peninsula that gained independence from Britain in 1957, and two states from the Borneo Island, Sabah and Sarawak which became members of the Federation of Malaya in 1963. Ruling party, Barisan Nasional (BN) consists of 13 parties and has 137 seats in the parliament. In history, BN has dominated the political framework and easily won each election since the first national vote in 1959. The incumbent Barisan Nasional coalition returned to power in the 2008 general elections with 140 seats. The opposition parties that would later form the Pakatan Rakyat coalition won a total of 82 seats, thereby denying the BN its two-thirds majority which is required to pass amendments to the Federal Constitution. Following their losses, then Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi announced on 8 October 2008 that he was stepping down, resigning his post as United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party leader. A leadership election was held on 26 March 2009, where then Deputy Prime Minister and Prime Minister-designate Najib Tun Razak was elected unopposed as the UMNO party leader. On 2 April 2009, Prime Minister Abdullah tendered his resignation to the Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin (who was the Yang di-Pertuan Agong) which was consented. On 3 April 2009, Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak was sworn in as the sixth Prime Minister of Malaysia at the Istana Negara, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in front of Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin. Pakatan Rakyat (PR) has 76 seats in the Malaysian Parliament and is composed of three large parties. Pakatan Rakyat gained control of five out of thirteen state assemblies (has since lost state assembly to BN due to defection in Perak) and 10 of the 11 parliamentary seats in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur. Former Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia and the Leader of the Opposition Anwar Ibrahim, also the head of Pakatan Rakyat was returned to parliament after a ten-year absence following his victory in the Permatang Pauh by-election. The by-election was triggered when his wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail resigned from her Permatang Pauh parliamentary seat, allowing Anwar to contest the seat and subsequently return to parliament. Even before the dissolution of Parliament, both the incumbent BN and Pakatan Rakyat brought up a number of issues and incentives to be given to the Malaysian electorate to gain a decisive advantage during the election. Both coalitions released separate election manifestos dealing with issues such as minimum wage, taxation, assistance to small-medium industries, racial relations and financial assistance to the poor. The 2013 elections also saw a number of new measures introduced that are intended to improve the electoral process. Since the 2008 general election a Parliament Select Committee was formed to make recommendations to improve the country's electoral process. The general election in 2013 brought about the introduction of Indelible ink to prevent voters from voting more than once. The indelible ink was mooted for use during the elections in 2008 but was scrapped by the Election Commission at the last minute. However, it was a source of controversy as reports of voters claiming that the indelible ink could be easily washed off were circulated in the media. There was also advanced voting for civil servants and military personnel in place of postal voting. This was partly in response to protests by election watchdog groups and opposition parties that the previous voting procedures were not transparent and prone to manipulation. The Election Commission introduced for the first time postal voting for Malaysians who resided overseas. However, these came with conditions, among them being that overseas Malaysians have to have been in Malaysia a number of times in the last five years. Overseas Malaysians residing in Singapore, southern Thailand, Brunei or Kalimantan in Indonesia were also not qualified to register as postal voters but had to return to their constituency if they were to cast their ballots. The EC also permitted the disabled to bring along an assistant into the polling booth to aid them in the voting process. When Najib took over from Abdullah Badawi, he began enlarging the budget of the Prime Minister's Department, where he appointed Koh Tsu Koon to be in charge of the Government Transformation Programme (GTP), which includes monitoring the performance of ministries and six national key result areas (NKRAs) through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). He also appointed the former CEO of Malaysia Airlines Idris Jala to help monitor the implementation of the KPIs in the form of the government's Performance Management and Delivery Unit (Pemandu). Najib's administration also introduced the slogan 1Malaysia in which he called for the embracing all Malaysians of various ethnic groups, national unity and efficient governance. This became public policy, involving various initiatives like the introduction of Kedai Rakyat 1Malaysia's discount grocery stores to help the poor, 1Malaysia clinics providing free basic medical services and free email accounts (1Malaysia Email) for the Malaysian populace. His administration also began the distribution of financial aid to Malaysian households earning less than RM3,000 called 1Malaysia People's Aid or Bantuan Rakyat 1Malaysia (BR1M). A second round of BR1M financial allocations were made out in February 2013 totalling RM2.6 billion. Another issue that arose was UMNO endorsing controversial candidates from the Malay right-wing group Perkasa to contest in the upcoming elections such as Zulkifli Noordin and Ibrahim Ali. Although Ibrahim Ali contested the Pasir Mas parliamentary seat as an independent candidate, the BN candidate who was supposed to challenge Ibrahim Ali did not file his nomination papers. The Pasir Mas parliamentary seat was the only seat without a BN candidate in this election. During the election campaign, Muhyiddin Yassin, the incumbent Deputy Prime Minister had called for Malay Muslims to fight the alleged spread of LGBT movements and freedom of religion among the Malays. Furthermore, Najib has said that his government will defend the prohibition of the usage of the word 'Allah' by non-Muslims, which is currently being challenged in court. The national BN manifesto pledges the following commitments to be realised within the next 5 years if and when they secure a mandate to form the next Malaysian government: The opposition Pakatan Rakyat (PR) has remain focused on the good governance of the Malaysian states (Kedah, Penang, Kelantan and Selangor) that they currently control despite not getting full assistance from the federal government One of the points they have made is the strong economic performance of the two states of Penang and Selangor which were reported in the media to have attracted higher business investments compared to other state governments with a BN majority. Some aspects of Pakatan's Election Manifesto is borrowed from their administrative masterplan Buku Jingga. In 2011, Penang and Selangor recorded a total of RM 17.8 billion in investments in the manufacturing sector, slightly more than 30% of the national share. PR announced its intention to replace the criticised New Economic Policy which they claim was discriminatory and only benefited certain groups of people, such as UMNO-connected individuals. Another main election promise they brought up was to cut the amount of spending wastages and the usage of direct aid to pay for social causes and provide free education around the country. One of the other issues is the Pakatan Rakyat's tussle for control of water company Syabas with the federal government, which has allegedly been mismanaging their operations. They have promised to give free water for the poor and unfortunate in the state of Selangor. PR also promised to close down the Lynas Advance Materials Plant situated in Kuantan, Pahang if it is deemed unsafe. This received the support of Himpunan Hijau, the green movement opposed to the operations of the Lynas plant, whose chairman, Wong Tack will be contesting in the elections under the DAP banner. PR also promised to increase the petroleum royalty payments from national oil company Petronas to petroleum-producing states (Pahang, Kelantan, Terengganu, Sabah and Sarawak) in Malaysia, irrespective of the party that forms the next state government. On 13 April 2013, the Registrar of Societies (ROS) sent a letter to DAP, that due to technical glitches in the party polls, several of DAP's members were requested to attend an inquiry on 18 April 2013. This could have endangered DAP's chance to contest in the general election due to fears that the party might be deregistered. DAP had mulled the intention for their candidates to contest under the banner of PKR and PAS, butreceived assurance from the ROS that their symbol could be used legally during the general elections. In Sarawak, opposition party DAP had put up election billboards highlighting the issue of murdered Mongolian Altantuyaa Sharibuu, but these billboards were torn down by enforcement officers. Following protests made by local DAP members, it was explained that the election billboards were removed as it depicted a person who was not contesting in the elections. The national PR manifesto has outlined the actions they will take if they form the next Malaysian government. The following actions have been pledged to be implemented immediately, in accordance with the Kuching Declaration: The election also brought in the entry of many third parties that influenced the election outcome in many parliament and state seats. Indian-based party Human Rights Party Malaysia, which was instrumental in organising Indians in protests against the government such as Hindraf rally in 2007, contested in several seats in Peninsular Malaysia. Currently, there are two camps in Hindraf: one aligned to Barisan Nasional and another that is neutral. Borneo-based parties such as Sabah Progressive Party (SAPP) (a former BN coalition partner) and the State Reform Party (STAR) contested the election on their own after a breakdown in talks with PR in having one to one contests against BN. The entry of these parties have brought about multi-cornered fights in Sabah and Sarawak. One of the main issues they brought up was the increasing number of illegals in Sabah and of the Royal Commission of Inquiry on illegal immigrants in Sabah. Furthermore, SAPP and STAR are partners in the United Borneo Front which fights for the equal status of Sabah and Sarawak as stipulated in the Malaysia Agreement that was made in 1963. The election watchdog group Bersih will be a big factor in the elections as they were responsible for organising large rallies calling for the electoral reforms in Malaysia in 2011 and 2012. They have pointed out that the electoral roll was marred by irregularities such as gerrymandering, phantom voters, malapportionment and postal vote fraud. Bersih has also warned against politicians or groups that support intimidation and violence against the electorate. Bersih has added to its blacklist of politicians who perpetuate the cycle of political violence such as Home Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, Defence Minister Zahid Hamidi and BN candidate Hamidah Othman.  Bersih has criticised both the BN-majority federal and PR-majority Selangor state caretaker governments for using government resources for election campaigning purposes. Nominations for candidates were made on 20 April 2013 between 9am and 10am. For the first time in Malaysian electoral history, all seats were contested and no candidate won a seat unopposed, with some candidates facing as many as 6 opponents. There were 579 parliamentary candidates contesting for 222 parliamentary seats, and 1,322 candidates fighting for 505 state seats. During the first three days of the official campaigning period, a total of 387 incidents were reported, with no fewer than 15 people arrested by the police for investigation. On 23 April 2013 in Nibong Tebal, an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) exploded at the site of a BN rally, injuring one. The police subsequently discovered a second IED at the site, which was later safely detonated. Both the incumbent Prime Minister Najib Razak and opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim have condemned the violence. The bombings have also been condemned by Bersih who said that all politicians should condemn the violence regardless of party affiliation. Bersih has offered to monitor police reports made on political violence and incidents of electoral misconduct. Opposition political gatherings were disrupted by bikers. On 24 April 2013, a press photographer was assaulted by bikers spotted wearing 1Malaysia shirts at a gathering by DAP in Bukit Gelugor. The state BN chief has denied any connection with the incident. Additionally, there have been numerous reports of vandalism against vehicles used by opposition politicians and their supporters. In one incident, two cars belonging to a PKR candidate's daughter were damaged following an arson attempt at her residence in Klang. A number of sexually explicit videos allegedly portraying opposition figures have surfaced in cyberspace, notably on blogs hostile towards the Pakatan Rakyat. The secretary-general of PAS, Datuk Mustafa Ali, who was implicated in one of the videos has denied his involvement, with his lawyer calling the videos ""a pure slander campaign by UMNO"". In turn, UMNO has sued Mustafa and his lawyer over those allegedly libelous statements. Anwar Ibrahim has also sued UMNO blogger and election candidate Wan Muhammad Azri Wan Deris for trying to implicate him in one of the explicit videos. A number of anti-Christian billboards have appeared during the election campaign period, bringing up the ire of the Christian Federation of Malaysia, who have called for the removal of such billboards. Users of several online news and media websites, such as independent news site Malaysiakini have claimed that several Malaysian internet service providers (ISPs) were throttling their access speeds to the sites. Several independent websites critical of the government, such as Radio Free Malaysia and Sarawak Report have experienced DDoS attacks. Malaysiakini have claimed that their Twitter account was hacked and their videos inaccessible through local ISPs. There have been a number of reports by the opposition alleging that the incumbent government is flying in thousands of foreigners to parts of Malaysia to influence the outcome of the vote in favour of BN. BN in turn has denied any wrongdoing, saying these flights were sponsored by ""friends of BN"". Bersih has called the provision of flights for voters an election offence. The opposition said that many of their supporters and agents will be monitoring the situation and making citizen's arrests of foreigners who vote. Postal voting for overseas Malaysians were conducted in various Malaysian representative offices around the world. According to the Election Commission (EC), 70% of 8,756 people who were eligible to vote overseas turned up to vote despite some teething problems. Early voting was conducted for military, police personnel and their spouses in 544 polling centres throughout Malaysia. It was estimated that there were 270,000 of these voters in total. There have been several reports regarding the usage of indelible ink for early voters, with some claiming that the ink could be easily washed off. The Election Commission has promised to conduct investigations on this issue after a number of reports lodged by several opposition parties. On 2 May 2013, the EC held a public demonstration on the application of indelible ink. During this demonstration, the stain left behind by the ink was attempted to be washed off using various means, but without success. Addressing the earlier claims and reports of the stain being easily removed, EC deputy chairman Datuk Wan Ahmad Wan Omar stated that this could be due to improper application procedures. He said that if the ink bottles were not thoroughly shook before use, the applied ink may contain insufficient quantities of silver nitrate, the compound used in the ink that leaves a permanent stain. General voting began at 8.00am on 5 May 2013 with a total of 13,268,002 Malaysians eligible to cast their ballots at 8,789 polling centres nationwide. Voter turnout is expected to be at an all-time high surpassing the 2008 election. As of 12pm, 58.99% of voters have cast their ballots, nationwide. Voting closed at 5pm however voters inside the polling stations are allowed to continue casting their ballots. Estimated turnout was 80%. Najib Razak told the media the day after the election: ""We have to show to the world that we are a mature democracy. Whatever happens, the decision of the people, the will of the people must be respected."" He added: ""After my inauguration as prime minister, I vow to honestly carry out all my obligations with full dedication. I will be truly faithful to Malaysia and will preserve, protect and defend the institution."" Anwar Ibrahim reacted in calling for two days of protests in saying the win was the ""worst electoral fraud in our history"" and that he ""call upon as many Malaysians to join hands and express our rejection and disgust at the unprecedented electoral fraud committed by Najib Razak and the EC (Election Commission)."" Herizal Hazri of the Malaysia Asia Foundation said: ""There is a sense of rejection within the urban Malaysian voters to accept this rhetoric. They want a more inclusive Malaysia, they want to vote for parties that represents all race groups."" The opposition parties had promised to revise Malaysia's affirmative action policy which favours Malays and other indigenous groups (""Bumiputra"") over the Chinese and Indian minorities. Prime Minister Najib Razak claimed that this was the reason why ethnic Chinese voted for the opposition. The most perceivable swing from the ruling coalition to the opposition, namely from the BN-affiliated MCA and Gerakan parties to the DAP, was among ethnic Chinese voters. This led to Najib claiming that the opposition had manipulated and deceived this population group and making a ""Chinese tsunami"" accountable for his alliance's losses. However, the claim was disputed by political analyst Datuk Dr Shamsul Amri Baharuddin, who claimed it was more accurately, an urban swing. The geographic distribution of votes shows a considerable difference between largely urban regions with a great proportion of ethnic Chinese which mostly voted for the oppositional alliance – often by a high margin – and more rural states populated by ""Bumiputra"" where the governing coalition won most of its seats. On 8 May Anwar led a rally in the Kelana Jaya football stadium near Kuala Lumpur. According to online sources that support PR, 120,000 people participated. Since the stadium usually can hold approximately 25,000 people, skeptics estimated that the number of participants ranged from 64,000 to 69,000. PR supporters claimed that the election was a sham. Pakatan Rakyat suffered from a leadership crisis after the election, including the withdrawal of PAS from the coalition in 2015. The coalition thus automatically dissolved and was replaced by Pakatan Harapan.",Normal
"Mismatch repair cancer syndrome (MMRCS) is a cancer syndrome associated with biallelic DNA mismatch repair mutations. It is also known as Turcot syndrome (after Jacques Turcot, who described the condition in 1959) and by several other names. In MMRCS, neoplasia typically occurs in both the gut and the central nervous system (CNS). In the large intestine, multiple colonic polyps develop; in the CNS, brain tumors. Under the name constitutional mismatch repair-deficiency, (CMMR-D), it has been mapped to MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2. Monoallelic mutations of these genes are observed in the condition known as Lynch syndrome or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, while biallelic mutations are observed in CMMR-D. People expressing the HNPCC (which itself is considered autosomal dominant) trait are considered carriers of CMMR-D, thus CMMR-D is classified as autosomal recessive. The term ""childhood cancer syndrome"" has also been proposed. Café-au-lait macules have been observed. Childhood to early adult onset HNPCC + malignant gliomas. The polyps developed tend to be larger, fewer, and progress to malignancy earlier than those seen in familial adenomatous polyposis, a clinically similar condition with different underlying mutations. Diagnostic testing consists of a blood sample being collected, and a genetic specialist compares two copies of a patient's gene to normal MMR genes. If there are differences in the genes, the specialists are able to further test and decide if the patient has the deficiency.  OMIM currently includes ""Turcot syndrome"" under Mismatch repair cancer syndrome. Turcot syndrome is the association between familial polyposis of the colon and brain tumors like medulloblastoma, malignant glioma. It was first reported by Canadian surgeon Jacques Turcot (1914-1977 ) et al. in 1959 and hence carries the first author's name. Cronkhite–Canada",Normal
"Stefan Bronisław Starzyński (19 August 1893– between 21 and 23 December 1939) was a Polish statesman, economist, military officer and Mayor of Warsaw before and during the Siege of 1939. Stefan Bronisław Starzyński was born on 19 August 1893 in Warsaw. He participated in the 1905 school strike. After graduating from a gymnasium, he enrolled in the Department of Economics at the Higher School of Trade (Wyższe Kursy Handlowe), a private-run university, now Warsaw School of Economics. In 1909 he also joined various patriotic organizations, including the Riflemen's Association (Związek Strzelecki). In August 1914, after the outbreak of the Great War, he joined Piłsudski's Polish Legions and became an ordinary soldier in the 1st Brigade. He took part in all battles and skirmishes of his Brigade and was quickly promoted to officer. After the Pledge Crisis in 1917 he was arrested and, together with most of his colleagues, interned in Beniaminów. In November 1918 he joined the Polish Army and became the Chief of Staff of the 9th Polish Infantry Division. During the Polish-Bolshevik War he was transferred to the 2nd Department of the General Staff, which carried out mostly intelligence tasks. After demobilization he remained in public service. He supervised one of the repatriation commissions in Moscow and later one of the departments of the Ministry of Treasury. In the years 1929–30 and 1931–32 he was a deputy minister of the treasury. In 1930 he became a member of Polish Sejm for a three years period as a member of the Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government (BBWR). He was also a deputy president of Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego, one of the largest Polish banks. During his life he published several academic papers on the economy. In the early 1930s Warsaw had a huge hole in its budget. The city's development had been halted by a lack of funds while the population continued to grow rapidly. On 1 August 1934, Starzyński was chosen by the Sanacja régime to become the president of Warsaw, and was given special powers. Local authorities were disbanded and Starzyński became responsible only to central government. At first Starzyński was viewed by the majority of Varsovians as yet another Sanacja stooge imposed on a city that mostly supported the opposition. But he soon gained popularity, even among his former enemies. He initiated a plan for fast-track reform of the financial system. The money saved thanks to these reforms was reinvested in public works that reduced unemployment. He managed to electrify the suburbs of Wola and Grochów, pave all the major roads out of Warsaw, and to connect the city centre with the newly built northern district of Żoliborz through a bridge over the northern railway line. These actions earned him the nickname ""president of the suburbs"". He became popular among the inhabitants of the borough of Śródmieście (City Centre) for his action of planting trees and flowers along the main streets. Starzyński also ordered the creation of a huge park in Wola and several minor green areas in other parts of the city. During his presidency Warsaw was also enlarged to the south. The area of former airfield on Pole Mokotowskie in the borough of Mokotów was cut in two parts by Aleje Niepodległości (Avenue of Independence), nowadays one of the main streets of Warsaw. Among the most important facilities opened during his presidency were the National Museum, new building of the city library, new building of his alma mater, now renamed to Warsaw School of Economics and the Powszechny theatre, which became one of the most influential scenes of Warsaw. Other initiatives of Starzyński include complete reconstruction of boulevards along the Vistula and partial reconstruction of the barbican in the Old Town area. In 1934 he was chosen as a president of Warsaw for a four-year term. On 18 December 1938 he was elected in democratic elections for his second term. Starzyński held his office until World War II broke out. During his presidency: After the start of Polish Defensive War of 1939 Starzyński, refused to leave Warsaw together with other state authorities and diplomats on 4 September 1939. Instead he joined the army as a major of infantry. The Minister of War shortly before his departure created the Command of the Defense of the Capital with general Walerian Czuma as its commander. On 7 September the forces of 4th German Panzer Division managed to break the Polish lines near Częstochowa and started their march towards Warsaw. Most of the city authorities were evacuated to the east. Warsaw was left with a military garrison composed mainly of infantry battalions and batteries of artillery. The Headquarters of general Czuma had to organize the defense of the city. Unfortunately, there was some misunderstanding among the command. At that time Poland still believed that any time soon Great Britain and France would attack Germany according to the treaties which were signed by these countries at the beginning of 1939. As it happened these obligations were never to materialise. However, at that stage the Polish authorities wanted to preserve younger reservists for future fighting, so the spokesman of the garrison of Warsaw issued a communique in which he ordered all young men to leave the city. That step weakened the strength of the defence garrison. To counter the mess that started in Warsaw, general Czuma appointed Stefan Starzyński as the Civilian Commissar of Warsaw. Starzyński started to organize the Civil Guard to replace the evacuated police forces. He also ordered all members of the city's administration to retake their posts. In his daily radio releases he asked all civilians to construct barricades and anti-tank barriers at the outskirts of Warsaw. According to many sources from the epoch his daily speeches were a crucial factor in keeping the morale of both the soldiers and the civilians high during the Siege of Warsaw. Starzyński commanded the distribution of food, water and supplies as well as fire fighting brigades. He also managed to organise shelter for almost all civilian refugees from other parts of Poland and houses destroyed by German aerial bombardment. Before the Siege ended he became the symbol of the defence of Warsaw in 1939. On 27 September the commanders of the besieging German forces demanded that Starzyński be present during the signing of the capitulation of Warsaw. Before the capitulation he was offered to leave the city several times. The pilot of the prototype PZL.46 Sum plane that managed to escape from internment in Romania and landed safely in besieged Warsaw offered himself to evacuate Starzyński to Lithuania. He was also proposed to go underground and receive plastic surgery in order to escape the city. He refused. After the Germans entered the city on 28 September 1939, Starzyński was allowed to continue his service as the president of Warsaw. He was active in organisation of life in the occupied city as well as its reconstruction after the German terror bombing campaign. At the same time he became one of the organizers of Służba Zwycięstwu Polski, the first underground organisation in occupied Poland that eventually became the Armia Krajowa. Among other things he provided it with thousands of clean forms of ID cards, birth registry forms and passports. Those documents were later used in validation of false identities of many members of the resistance. On 5 October he was arrested by the Gestapo and, together with several other prominent inhabitants of Warsaw, held hostage as a warrant of safety for Adolf Hitler during a parade of victory held in Warsaw. The following day all of them were released. On 27 October 1939 he was again arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned in the Pawiak prison. In December he was yet again offered to escape, but he again refused claiming that it would be too costly to those involved in his escape. His fate remained unknown until, on 8 September 2014, the Polish IPN-Institute of National Remembrance (Instytut Pamięci Narodowej) officially closed the investigation of the circumstances of his death. Based on a recent eyewitness testimony, the IPN's commission of inquiry came to the conclusion that Stefan Starzyński was shot by the Gestapo at some point between 21 and 23 December 1939. in Warsaw or its surroundings. The crime was committed by Gestapo functionaries Oberscharführer Hermann Schimmann, Hauptscharführer Weber, and Unterscharführer Perlbach. However, it has not been possible to unambiguously establish the Gestapo functionaries who had given the order to kill Stefan Starzyński. According to an earlier version of the account, which has been discarded by the IPN, it was believed that Starzyński had been transferred to Moabit prison in Berlin and then to Dachau concentration camp, where he was thought to have died. Several other accounts had assumed that he was either transferred to a potash mine in Baelberge or that he was held hostage in Warsaw until the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising. The date of his death was assumed to be 17 October 1943 (shot dead in the Dachau concentration camp), although other versions mentioned August 1944 (Warsaw), 1944 (Baelberge), 1943 (Spandau prison) or January 1940 (Dachau). One version of the account was based on documents, which the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) had received from Germany in 2008. The documents had been held in the archives of former East German Ministry of State Security (""Stasi""), and they claimed that Starzyński was tortured and died on 19 March 1944 in a potassium salt mine, where he was allegedly held captive at a prisoner of subsidiaries camp and slave-worked in Leipzig Enterprise Transport, which produced aircraft parts. According to witnesses, he was allegedly placed on the board set on trestles, holding 2 full buckets of water, under the ""penalty"" of being shot if he would drop them. According to this account, Starzyński stood on it until he collapsed and died of exhaustion. This version of the circumstances of Starzyński's death was also discarded by the IPN in September 2014. In 1957, a memorial was erected to his memory in the Powązki cemetery in Warsaw. After the war the rebuilt Warszawa II radio station was named after him. Currently there are several monuments to Starzyński in Warsaw as well as a street and several schools named after him. His September 1939 radio broadcasts are now considered to be a part of popular culture in Poland. Starzyński's quiet, hoarsened voice and the texts of his speeches are nowadays easily recognizable by most Varsovians. In 2003 the readers of news papers and the spectators of the Warsaw branch of the public television elected Starzyński as the Varsovian of the Century by a huge majority of votes. In 1978 his popularized story was filmed by Andrzej Trzos-Rastawiecki in his movie Gdziekolwiek jesteś, panie prezydencie (Wherever You Are, Mr. President).",Normal

"The French Voulet-Chanoine Mission, led by the captains Paul Voulet and Julien Chanoine, had been dispatched in 1898 to Africa by the French government with the mission to conquer the territories between the Niger River and Lake Chad and join in uniting French territories in West Africa. After leaving French Sudan in January 1899, they ruthlessly subjugated the native peoples, meeting little resistance. One of the few to resist was the sorcerer queen Sarraounia, ruler of the Azna, a pagan people in a long Islamized region. Determined to bar the expedition's road, Sarraounia wrote to Voulet a provocative letter full of insults; the French took up the challenge, and on 15 April left the camp, marching towards the villages of Lougou and Tougana, where Sarraounia had concentrated her forces. The day after, at 6:00, started what Lt. Paul Joalland called ""one of the hottest moments of the campaign"". The French found the enemy assembled on the field, while women and children had already retired themselves in a small thick and almost impenetrable bush where the Azna defended themselves when facing a superior enemy. After the Azna had started to disperse under the French gunfire, their lines broke when hit by three grapeshot balls; the Azna then retreated in the bush, where the thick foliage partly protected the natives from the gunfire. The French felt that if left there, the Azna may attack them at night; so it was decided to assault the bush, but being careful to leave a way of escape for the Azna open, so to avoid a too deadly confrontation that could cost too much blood. The French met a strong resistance, killing two riflemen and wounding four, but were at the end successful and forced the Azna to escape. The battle had protracted itself till 13:00, and among the French tirailleurs four were killed and six wounded, with 7,000 cartridges consumed.",Normal

He coached Norwegian side Brann between 1974 and 1978 and in December 1978 returned to Sunderland as manager. He remained in charge until the end of the season, almost guiding Sunderland to promotion.

"The Emporia State University Teachers College is an education college located in Emporia, Kansas, United States. It is a part of Emporia State University. The university was established in 1863 as Kansas State Normal School. A university history gives 1907 as the first date teacher training was organized as a department. Since then, The Teachers College has been through a few name changes: The National Teachers Hall of Fame (NTHF) is a non-profit organization that honors exceptional school teachers. The NTHF was established in 1989 by a consortium of organizations including Emporia State, the Alumni Association of the school, the City of Emporia, Emporia Public Schools, as well as the Emporia Area Chamber of Commerce. The NTHF has a museum on Emporia State's campus that honors the teachers inducted. Every June, the Hall of Fame inducts five of the most outstanding educators in the United States. On June 13, 2013, the NTHF executive director Carol Strickland, along with former ESU President Michael Shonrock, Bill Maness, representing U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, and former mayor Rob Gilligan, broke ground by the one-room school house located on the Emporia State campus to build a memorial for the teachers that have fallen in the ""line of duty"". The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was the main inspiration for the memorial. On June 6, 2014, the granite memorial markers were placed along with granite benches. The official dedication was on June 12, 2014. On September 21, 2015, United States Senator Jerry Moran introduced a bill to the United States Congress to designate the memorial as the ""National Memorial to Fallen Educators"". Since the bill was passed by both the United States House of Representatives and Senate, the memorial was signed by the President of the United States, and the memorial did not become a part of the National Park Service nor are federal funds used. The Teachers College at Emporia State University is one of only four post-secondary institutions in the nation—along with Alverno College, Stanford University, and University of Virginia—to be identified as an Exemplary Model Teacher Education program by Arthur Levine in his 2006 national study of teacher education programs Educating School Teachers.",Normal

"The Chapel of Our Lady of Itria, also known as the Church of Our Lady of Hodegetria (Maltese: Knisja tal-Madonna ta’ Hodegitria), is a small Roman Catholic church in the Binġemma area of Mġarr, Malta. Another chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Hodegetria was originally built close by in 1600 by Giovanni Maria Xara, a local land owner. This church building was not maintained properly and in 1658, Bishop Miguel Jerónimo de Molina order it to be desecrated. Xara's nephew, Staninslaw, recovered the stones from this small building in 1680 and started building a slightly larger one a few meters away from the other one. The younger baron and his heirs provided full financial support for all the construction and maintenance of the new building, which is the chapel that has survived to our time. This historical origin story is captured in a marble inscription inside the church itself. The new chapel retained the original dedication to the Hodegetria, which was a popular title for churches in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, owing to the Basilian Fathers association with the orthodox devotion to the Madonna Odegitria (that is, ‘the Virgin Mary who shows the way’), who also founded a monastic site in southern Italy's Itria Valley. The chapel consists of the church, a small sacristy built on the side of the church, and which has a door to the outside, and a small room above the sacristy, which was intended as private quarters for the priest who took charge of the chapel. From the construction materials, including a steel beam, it is evident that the sacristy and the room above it were built some time after the chapel, however, it is not known exactly when this occurred. The building is situated on the edge of a Binġemma Valley rock cliff, immediately above a Punic tomb. The church is within the proximity of the Victoria Lines. The church has a small parvise, with four steps in the middle leading to the main entrance. Two small glass windows enable you to see inside the church even when the door is closed. The front and the rest of the building is quite plain. Above the door there is a round window, and above this window is a coat of arms Baron Stanislaw Xara, who built this church. Above the church is a small arched bell tower with a cross on it, and a bronze bell. In the corners of the facade, at the top, there are triangular stone designs that give the chapel its recognizable feature that distinguishes it from an ordinary stone room built in a rural area. The inside of the building is also quite plain, with one stone altar and a wooden one clearly added in the latter part of the twentieth century. A single large ex-voto painting hangs above the altar. The only other images inside the building are the stations of the cross, which were donated by Countess Marija Antonia Sant through a papal decree on 28 December 1870.

"John Fremont Melby (July 1, 1913 – December 18, 1992) was a United States diplomat, who served in the Soviet Union from 1943 to 1945 and in China from 1945 to 1948. He held other positions with the Department of State until 1953, when he was dismissed as a security risk because of his long and intimate association with the playwright Lillian Hellman, who was accused of communist ties. He later became an academic specializing in Far Eastern affairs. Melby was born in Portland, Oregon, on July 1, 1913 to Harry Charles Melby and Helen Fremont. He moved several times in his childhood. He spent part of it in Brazil, where he became fluent in Portuguese and French. He attended Bloomington High School in Bloomington, Illinois, and was graduated from Illinois Wesleyan University in 1934. He received a master's degree and a doctorate in political science at the University of Chicago. Melby joined the Foreign Service in 1937 and that year took up his first State Department assignment in Juarez, Mexico. In 1938, he married Florence Cathcart, whom he met across the border in El Paso, Texas. His next posting was Caracas, Venezuela, where he served as vice consul from 1939 to 1941. In 1943 he was assigned to the American Embassy in Moscow, where his rank did not allow him to bring his family. He and his wife, the parents of two boys, grew apart during his absence in Moscow and never lived together again. In 1944, Melby met the playwright, Lillian Hellman, whom President Roosevelt had sent on a cultural good-will mission to Moscow. They were equally committed to the U.S.-Soviet alliance of World War II. They began an affair that lasted several years. In 1945, he attended the founding conference of the United Nations in San Francisco as liaison officer for the Soviet delegation, handling details ranging from transportation to translations. He described it as the work of ""nursemaid, office boy, and messenger."" That same year, at the suggestion of U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Averell Harriman, he was sent to China, where Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Government was fighting Mao Zedong's army, in order to monitor the role of the Soviets in China. He was second secretary and vice consul in Chungking in 1944-1945 and then in the embassy's new location in Nanking in 1946-7, and then second secretary and consul in Nanking in 1947-48. In December 1945, he recorded his assessment of the two sides in his diary: One of the great mysteries to me is why one group of people retains faith, whereas another from much the same origins and experiences loses it. Over the years the Communists have absorbed an incredible amount of punishment, have been guilty of their own share of atrocities, and yet have retained a kind of integrity, faith in their destiny, and the will to prevail. By contrast the Guomindang  has gone through astonishing tribulations, has committed its excesses, has survived a major war with unbelievable prestige, and is now throwing everything away at a frightening rate, because the revolutionary faith is gone and has been replaced by the smell of corruption and decay. He faulted U.S. policy in his diary in June 1948 as the communist victory neared: ""All the power of the United States will not stem the tides of Asia, but all the wisdom of which we are capable might conceivably make those tides a little more friendly to us than they are now."" Melby and Hellman found their political views diverging during Melby's years in China. He came to advocate containment of Communism while she was unwilling to hear criticism of the Soviet Union. They became, in one historian's view, ""political strangers, occasional lovers, and mostly friends."" Her support for Henry Wallace in the 1948 campaign proved an especially sore point. When Wallace blamed the Soviet takeover of Czechoslovakia on U.S. policy, Melby wrote Hellman: I don't know who is advising Wallace, but he is certainly giving him some bum poop. This latest outburst of his could hardly be more inaccurate. He simply does not know whereof he speaks when his facts are as completely off base as I know they are in this case. It gives one to wonder about the rest. In March 1948, Melby delivered an address the National Catholic Educational Conference of China in Shanghai, in which he called communism an ""iron helmet over the minds of men"" and which his hosts called ""the strongest public condemnation of communism by an American diplomat so far uttered by an American diplomat in China."" Melby was recalled to Washington and left China on December 15, 1948, as the communists were winning control. On instructions from his State Department superiors, he produced an analysis of the communist revolution in China and, with Charles Yost became a principal author of an influential study known as the China White Paper (1949). He held the view that Chiang and the Nationalists were responsible for the communist victory in China and privately criticized those who shared this belief, but surrendered to the interpretation of the pro-Chiang China Lobby in the U.S. and blamed the communists' success on the U.S. government and especially, on the State Department's China Hands. Because Melby's role in authoring the White Paper was not publicized, he escaped the criticism it received from the China Lobby. In 1950, he headed a sixteen-person mission, the Joint State-Defense Military Assistance Mission to Southeast Asia, also known as the Melby-Erskine mission, to study the military capabilities and requirements of Southeast Asian nations in light of the threat of communist advances. It was one of the first American missions to Vietnam to assess the struggle of communist insurgents against French colonial rule. Melby's assessment of French efforts was very pessimistic and he advised major changes in the French approach. He nevertheless recommended providing the military aid France was requesting. His policy recommendations were neither heeded nor communicated to the French. His State Department positions in these years were assistant chief of the division of Philippine Affairs in 1949, officer in charge of Philippine Affairs in 1949-50, and assistant to assistant secretary of state for Far Eastern Affairs from 1950 to 1953. In January 1951, following his divorce from his first wife, Melby married Hilda Hordern, a State Department employee whom he had first met in China in 1947, when she was secretary to Ambassador John Leighton Stuart. In the early 1950s, at the height of anti-communist fervor in the United States, the State Department investigated whether Melby posed a security risk. The investigation began in September 1951, a week after ex-communist Martin Berkeley told the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) that Hellman had attended an organizational meeting of the Communist Party in 1937. Initially, the issues Melby was asked to address were minor. Then in April 1952, the department stated its one formal charge against Melby: ""that during the period 1945 to date, you have maintained an association with one, Lillian Hellman, reliably reported to be a member of the Communist Party."" Based on unverified testimony from informants that she was a member of the Communist Party, along with her participation in many communist-front organizations and left-wing advocacy groups, Melby's suitability for government service was questioned, and when Melby appeared before the department's Loyalty Security Board, he was not allowed to contest Hellman's communist affiliation or learn the identity of those who informed against her, only his understanding of her politics and the nature of his relationship with her, including detailed discussion of their occasional renewal of their physical relationship. He never promised to avoid contact with Hellman, but allowed that he had no plans to renew their friendship. In the course of a series of appeals, Hellman testified before the Loyalty Security Board on his behalf. She offered to answer questions, but the board was not prepared to hear testimony about her politics, which it had already determined on the basis of an FBI investigation. She was only allowed to describe her relationship with Melby. She testified that she had many longstanding friendships with people of different political views and that political sympathy was not a part of those relationships. She described how her relationship with Melby changed over time and how their sexual relationship was briefly renewed in 1950 after a long hiatus: ""The relationship obviously at this point was neither one thing nor the other: it was neither over nor was it not over."" In summary, she said that: ... to make it black and white would be the lie it never has been, nor do I think many other relations ever are. I don't think it is as much a mystery as perhaps it looks. It has been a ... completely personal relationship of two people who once past being in love also happen to be very devoted to each other and very respectful of one another, and who I think in any other time besides our own would not be open to question of the complete innocence of and the complete morality, if I may say so, of people who were once in love and who have come out with respect and devotion to one another. After seven hearings, the State Department dismissed him on April 22, 1953. As was its practice, the loyalty board gave no reason for its decision. The entire process went unnoticed by the press. Melby later credited his good relations with the press: ""I think among newspapermen there was a kind of conspiracy to protect me."" In December 1960, as the Kennedy Administration took shape, Melby tried to have his security clearance restored, encouraged by the appointment of Dean Rusk, who was familiar with his State Department work, as the new Secretary of State. His longtime friend Averell Harriman was becoming ambassador-at-large. Robert F. Kennedy blocked their efforts. Appeals to State Department officials responsible for administrative matters failed, as did the advocacy of Pennsylvania Senator Joseph S. Clark Jr. on Melby's behalf. HUAC maintained a list of persons it considered ineligible for government employment that overrode State Department views. Melby dropped these efforts in 1966, when he moved to Canada. Harriman urged Melby to press the issue once again in 1977 at the start of the Carter administration, and Richard Holbrooke lent his support. Secretary of State Edmund Muskie restored Melby's security clearance in December 1980 and hired him to work as a consultant on the Sino-Vietnamese Conflict for several months. After his dismissal from the State Department in 1953, Melby was unable to find work for several years. The department blocked him from positions in other government agencies. The political climate made academic institutions wary of hiring former State Department employees, although he held a one-year research fellowship at Yale University's Southeast Asia program for the academic year 1955-56. From 1956 to 1959, Melby was executive vice chairman of the National Council on Asian Affairs, which promoted the inclusion of Asian studies in secondary school curricula. From 1956 to 1964, Melby served as the director of foreign studies at the University of Pennsylvania and taught part-time, and full-time in his final year. He stressed the importance of racial integration in U.S. education for the reputation of the U.S. overseas: No small part of traditional American prestige in Asia has come from our advocacy of ""desegregation"" for Asians. ... When we are concerned by foreign reactions we would do well to remember that in our position we no longer have a private life, and that what we do at home takes on an enlarged, perhaps often an exaggerated, importance in the eyes of the word as evidence of what an anxious world can expect from us. Undoubtedly what Mississippi does about its school system worries New Delhi more than it does Chicago. During the Kennedy administration, Sargent Shriver tried to appoint Melby as the director of Peace Corps operations in Indonesia and Melby worked briefly training volunteers headed for Ceylon. The appointment was blocked without any clear explanation, likely by anti-communists in Congress. In 1964, Melby wrote to Secretary of State Dean Rusk describing a similar outcome when he was considered for two positions at George Washington University. Negotiations appeared final, but no offer came, ""only evasion and vague apologies."" In 1966, Melby founded the department of political studies at Canada's University of Guelph, served as its first chairman for five years, and then continued as a professor. That same year, he joined a group of 198 scholars in a critique of U.S. policy toward China. It urged the admission of China to the United Nations, steps toward U.S. diplomatic recognition of China, the initiation of bilateral negotiations, and the trade of nonstrategic materials. Melby and Hordern, who was then working for the National Science Foundation and unwilling to move to Canada, divorced in 1967. He later married Canadian Roxana Carrier. In 1969, he published The Mandate of Heaven with a Canadian publisher after U.S. publishers turned him down. It was an expanded version of the diary he kept during his service in China, illustrated with photographs by Henri Cartier-Bresson. He dedicated the volume to Hellman. He presented an account that invited comparison with contemporary events in Vietnam. One reviewer summarized its depiction of U.S. policy as ""a bumbling effort to achieve vague purposes through the instrumentality of the Nationalist regime."" He retired from teaching in 1978. In retirement, he co-edited a collection of the correspondence of Constantine Nabokov, a minor Russian diplomat, to American Donald W. Nesbit. Melby died of a heart attack on December 18, 1992, in Guelph General Hospital, Guelph, Ontario, Canada. His third wife, Roxana Carrier Melby, survived him. His papers were deposited at the Harry S. Truman Library, which also holds an oral history based on interviews conducted with Melby in 1972. A prize named for Melby, is awarded by the department of Political Science at the University of Guelph.",Normal

"Osip Vasilyevich Aptekman (Russian: О́сип Васильевич Аптекма́н) (March 18(30), 1849, Pavlohrad – July 8, 1926) was a Russian revolutionary, member of the Land and Liberty, and one of the founders of the Black Repartition. Born in Ukraine to an upper class Jewish family, Osip Aptekman studied medicine in Kharkov from 1870. In 1873, as the start of the 'to the people' movement, when idealistic students travelled to the countryside hoping to radicalise the peasants, he and two other students from Kharkov, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and S.N.Kulasko set up a blacksmith shop in Gherea's home village, Slavyanka. They had to abandon the project to avoid arrest. He returned to Kharkov to complete his studies. In 1874, a few months after qualifying as a surgeon, he again 'went to the people' in the Volga region, and was one of the organisers of Land and Liberty (Земля и Воля - Zemlya i Volya). When Zemlya i Volya split in August 1879, with one faction - impatient with the failure to politicise the peasantry - breaking off the form the People's Will and plan the assassination of the Tsar, Aptekman joined the future founder of Russian Marxism, Georgi Plekhanov and in organising Black Partition (Черный Передел -Cherny Peredel) grouping which insisted that the continued use of propaganda was the best means of achieving social change. He edited the group's journal. In 1880, he was arrested and sentenced to five years exile in Yakutsk, in Siberia. When his term of exile ended, he emigrated to Munich, to resume his study of medicine. He returned to Russia in 1889, to practise as a country doctor in Nizhny Novgorod region. In 1893 and 1894 Aptekman was one of the primary leaders of the People's Rights Party (Partiia Narodnogo Prava), an illegal constitutionalist populist organization. But later in the same decade, when Marxist ideas began to spread among the young, he broke with the Narodniks and joined what became the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. When the RSDLP split, in 1903, he sided with the Mensheviks. During the 1905 revolution, he travelled from district to district, organising armed groups of revolutionaries, until he was arrested and imprisoned. Released in May 1906, he emigrated to Switzerland. After the outbreak of war in 1914. he sided with the Menshevik-Internationalists, led by Yuri Martov Having returned to Russia after the February Revolution, in 1919, aged 70, he announced that he accepted the legitimacy of the communist government. In his final years, he worked for the Historical and Revolutionary Archives, in St Petersburg. This Ukrainian biographical article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",Normal

"Mötley Crüe is an American heavy metal band formed in Hollywood, California in 1981. Bassist Nikki Sixx and drummer Tommy Lee first joined together with guitaristlead vocalist Greg Leon. But after some time, Leon was replaced by guitarist Mick Mars and lead vocalist Michael White respectively. The latter was soon replaced by Vince Neil and the Mötley Crüe moniker was chosen soon after that. The band has sold over 100 million albums worldwide. They have also achieved seven platinum or multi-platinum certifications, nine Top 10 albums on the Billboard 200 chart (including 1989's Dr. Feelgood, which is Mötley Crüe's only album to reach number one), twenty-two Top 40 mainstream rock hits, and six Top 20 pop singles. The band has experienced several lineup changes over the years, leaving Sixx as the only constant member; these included the introduction of lead vocalist John Corabi (who was Neil's replacement from 1992 to 1996) and drummers Randy Castillo and Samantha Maloney, both of whom filled in for Lee following his departure from Mötley Crüe in 1999; he returned to the band in 2004. In October 2022, after 41 years of service, Mars announced his retirement from touring with the band, with guitarist John 5 replacing him. The members of Mötley Crüe have often been noted for their hedonistic lifestyles and the androgynous personae they maintained. Following the hard rock and heavy metal origins on the band's first two albums, Too Fast for Love (1981) and Shout at the Devil (1983), the release of its third album Theatre of Pain (1985) saw Mötley Crüe joining the first wave of glam metal. The band is also known for their elaborate live performances, which feature flame thrower guitars, roller coaster drum kits, and heavy use of pyrotechnics such as fireworks and lighting Sixx on fire. Mötley Crüe's most recent studio album, Saints of Los Angeles, was released on June 24, 2008. What was planned to be the band's final show took place on New Year's Eve, December 31, 2015. The concert was filmed for a theatrical and Blu-ray release in 2016. After two-and-a-half years of inactivity, Neil announced in September 2018 that Mötley Crüe had reunited and was working on new material. On March 22, 2019, the band released four new songs on the soundtrack for its Netflix biopic The Dirt, based on the band's New York Times best-selling autobiography of the same name. The soundtrack went to number one on the iTunes All Genres Album Chart, number 3 on the Billboard Top Album and Digital Album sales charts, number 10 on the Billboard 200, and Top 10 worldwide. The autobiography returned to New York Times Best Seller list at number 6 on Nonfiction Print and number 8 on Nonfiction Combined Print & E-Book. Mötley Crüe embarked on its first major tour in seven years in the summer and fall of 2022, co-headlining a North American tour with Def Leppard. The nucleus of the group first came together in early 1981, when ex-Suite 19 guitaristlead vocalist Greg Leon and drummer Tommy Lee decided to form a new band. They attended the farewell gig of a popular local band called London, and Lee was already impressed by the image and stage presence of their bassist, Nikki Sixx. Even before meeting Sixx, Lee claims he had posters of London on his bedroom walls. ""Tommy just loved how Nikki looked"", recalled Leon. ""He was gung-ho about him, saying, 'This is the guy we should get'."" Sixx auditioned twice but Leon felt he was ""awful"", telling Lee ""He looks great. He's great on stage. But he can't play bass at all."" Lee subsequently became friends with Sixx and went to his Hollywood home to listen to new material he was working on. The music had been rejected by his London bandmates for being too heavy, and Lee says he immediately began banging on the table in time with the music and ""everything just seemed to mesh"". Lee subsequently hired Sixx for the new band, prompting guitaristvocalist Leon to quit in protest. ""I never played a show with Nikki Sixx. Tommy and I played together many times, but I was gone as soon as Nikki entered the picture. But they couldn't find a guitar player or singer initially, so they kept calling me. But I refused,"" Leon has said of his time in the band. Sixx and Lee began a search for new members and soon met guitarists Robin Moore (Jeff Gill) and Bob Deal, better known as Mick Mars, after answering an advertisement that he placed in The Recycler that read: ""Loud, rude and aggressive guitar player available"". Mars auditioned for Sixx, Moore and Lee, and was subsequently hired while Moore was fired at the same session according to the band's biography The Dirt. Although a lead vocalist named O'Dean Peterson was auditioned, Lee had known Vince Neil from their high school days at Charter Oak High School in Covina, California, and the two had performed in different bands on the garage band circuit. Upon seeing him perform with the band Rock Candy at the Starwood in Hollywood, California, Lee suggested they have Neil join the band. At first Neil refused the offer. On the same day as Mars, lead vocalist Michael White, who previously played with Nikki Sixx in the band London, joined the band. But White eventually ended up leaving too. As the other members of Rock Candy started to think about moving in more of a New Wave direction and became involved in outside projects, Vince Neil grew anxious to try something else. Lee asked again; Neil was hired on April 1, 1981, and the band played its first gig at the Starwood nightclub on April 24. I wanted a band that would be like David Bowie and the Sex Pistols thrown in a blender with Black Sabbath. —Nikki Sixx The newly formed band did not yet have a name. Sixx has said that he told his bandmates that he was ""thinking about calling the band Christmas"". The other members were not very receptive to that idea. Then, while trying to find a suitable name, Mars remembered an incident that occurred when he was playing with a band called White Horse, when one of the other band members called the group ""a motley looking crew"". He had remembered the phrase and later copied it down as 'Mottley Cru'. After slight modification of the spelling, ""Mötley Crüe"" was eventually selected as the band's name, with the stylistic decision suggested by Neil to add the two sets of metal umlauts, supposedly inspired by the German beer Löwenbräu, which the members were drinking at the time. Other than the periods of February 1992 to September 1996 and of March 1999 to September 2004, the lineup of Neil, Sixx, Lee, and Mars remained the same. The band soon met its first manager, Allan Coffman, the thirty-eight-year-old brother-in-law of a friend of Mars's driver. The band's first release was the single ""Stick to Your GunsToast of the Town"", which was released on its own record label, Leathür Records, which had a pressing and distribution deal with Greenworld Distribution in Torrance, California. On November 10, 1981, its debut album Too Fast for Love was self-produced and released on Leathür, selling 20,000 copies. Coffman's assistant Eric Greif set up a tour of Canada, while Coffman and Greif used Mötley Crüe's success in the Los Angeles club scene to negotiate with several record labels, eventually signing a recording contract with Elektra Records in early 1982. The debut album was then remixed by producer Roy Thomas Baker and re-released on August 20, 1982—two months after its Canadian Warner Music Group release using the original Leathür mixes—to coincide with the tour. Listening to Queen inspired Mötley Crüe to work with Roy Thomas Baker on Too Fast for Love. He would come in, ""Hello Darlings ..."" and listen for maybe thirty minutes or so and leave. And we're like, ""What?! Where's he going?"". But he produced Queen, so, man, we had to have him produce us, too. —Tommy Lee During the ""Crüesing Through Canada Tour '82"", there were several widely publicized incidents. First, the band was arrested and then released at Edmonton International Airport for wearing their spiked stage wardrobe (considered ""dangerous weapons"") through customs, and for Neil arriving with a small carry-on filled with porn magazines (considered ""indecent material""); both were staged PR stunts. Customs eventually had the confiscated items destroyed. Second, while playing Scandals Disco in Edmonton, a spurious ""bomb threat"" against the band made the front page of the Edmonton Journal on June 9, 1982; Lee and assistant band manager Greif were interviewed by police as a result. This too ended up being a staged PR stunt perpetrated by Greif. Lastly, Lee threw a television set from an upper story window of the Sheraton Caravan Hotel. Canadian rock magazine Music Express noted that the band was ""banned for life"" from the city. Despite the tour ending prematurely in financial disaster, it was the basis for the band's first international press. In 1983, the band changed management from Coffman to Doug Thaler and Doc McGhee. McGhee is best known for managing Bon Jovi and later Kiss, starting with their reunion tour in 1996. Greif subsequently sued all parties in a Los Angeles Superior Court action that dragged on for several years, and coincidentally later re-surfaced as manager of Sixx's former band, London. Coffman himself was sued by several investors to whom he had sold ""stock in the band"", including Michigan-based Bill Larson. Coffman eventually declared bankruptcy, as he had mortgaged his home at least three times to cover band expenses. ""Too Fast For Love"", the title track from the band's debut album, was reportedly recorded over a span of three days while the band members were under the influence of alcohol. The band became rapidly successful in the United States after playing at the US Festival on May 29, 1983, and also with the aid of the new medium of MTV. Their second album, Shout at the Devil, was released on September 26, 1983. The album represented the band's mainstream breakthrough and would eventually be certified 4× platinum. The album generated controversy for its title track and album imagery, both of which invoked Satanism. They then gained the attention of then-former Black Sabbath singer Ozzy Osbourne and found themselves opening for Osbourne on his 1984 tour for Bark at the Moon. The band members were well known for their backstage antics, outrageous clothing, extreme high-heeled boots, heavily applied make-up, and seemingly endless abuse of alcohol and drugs. The band members also had their share of run ins with the law. On December 8, 1984, Neil was driving home from a liquor run in his De Tomaso Pantera which ended in a head-on collision; his passenger, Hanoi Rocks drummer Nicholas ""Razzle"" Dingley, was killed. Neil, charged with a DUI and vehicular manslaughter, was sentenced to 30 days in jail (although he served only 18 days) and subsequently was sued for $2,500,000. The short jail term was negotiated by his lawyers, enabling Neil to tour and pay the civil suit. The band's third album Theatre of Pain was released on June 21, 1985 and dedicated in Dingley's honor, and it started a new glam metal phase in the band's style. Theatre of Pain was commercially successful, reaching number 6 on the Billboard album charts and eventually being certified quadruple platinum. However, the recording of the album was fraught with tension in the wake of Neil's accident and Sixx's growing addiction, and members of the band have said that they consider it a creative disappointment. Mötley Crüe spent most of the next year on a world tour in support of Theatre of Pain. In February 1986 in London, England Sixx suffered a near-fatal heroin overdose, and the person who sold him the drugs dumped his unconscious body in a dumpster. The incident inspired Sixx to write the song ""Dancing on Glass"" for their next album. The band's fourth album, Girls, Girls, Girls, was released on May 15, 1987 and debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200. Sixx has said in interviews that he believes the album would have debuted at number 1 if not for behind the scenes maneuvering by Whitney Houston's record label. The band again changed their look for the album and subsequent tour, trading the glam elements of the previous album for a biker aesthetic. The band faced many of the same personal issues that plagued the recording of Theatre of Pain and Sixx has complained that those issues compromised the album's quality, although he has spoken more positively about the record in subsequent years. On December 23, 1987, Sixx suffered a heroin overdose. He was declared clinically dead on the way to the hospital, but the paramedic, who was a Mötley Crüe fan, revived Sixx with two shots of adrenaline. His two minutes in death were the inspiration for the song ""Kickstart My Heart"", which peaked at No.16 on the Mainstream U.S. chart, and which was featured on 1989's Dr. Feelgood, their first U.S. number one album. From 1986 to 1987, Sixx kept a daily diary of his heroin addiction and eventually entered rehab in January 1988, prompting the band to cancel their planned dates for that year. While 1988 was the first year that Mötley Crüe did not tour, controversy again hit the band that year in the form of a lawsuit by Matthew Trippe. Trippe claimed that Sixx was hospitalized in 1983 after a car crash involving drugs and that he had been hired as Sixx's doppelgänger. The suit was regarding the loss of royalties from his time in Mötley Crüe and the case was not closed until 1993 when Trippe dropped his charges and disappeared from public view. Their decadent lifestyles almost shattered the band until managers Thaler and McGhee pulled an intervention and refused to allow the band to tour in Europe, fearing that ""some  would come back in bodybags"". Shortly after, all the band members jointly entered drug rehabilitation in an effort to move forward as a band. After finding sobriety, Mötley Crüe reached its peak popularity with the release of their fifth album, the Bob Rock-produced Dr. Feelgood, on September 1, 1989. Rock and the band recorded the album in Vancouver, with the band members recording their parts separately for the first time to reduce infighting and to focus on individual performance. Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler, who was recording the album Pump at the same studio, provided backing vocals. On October 14 of that year, it became a No.1 album and stayed on the charts for 114 weeks after its release. The band members each stated in interviews that, due in no small part to their collective push for sobriety, Dr. Feelgood was their most solid album musically to that point. The title track and ""Kickstart My Heart"" were both nominated for Grammys in the Best Hard Rock Category in 1990 and 1991, respectively, but lost both years to songs by Living Colour. The band did find some success at the American Music Awards, as Dr. Feelgood was nominated twice for Favorite Hard RockMetal Award, losing once to Guns N' Roses' Appetite for Destruction, but winning the following year, beating out Aerosmith's Pump and Poison's Flesh & Blood. Mötley Crüe was also nominated twice for Favorite Hard RockMetal Artist. In 1989, McGhee was fired after the band alleged he had broken several promises that he made in relation to the Moscow Music Peace Festival, including giving his other band, Bon Jovi, advantages in terms of slot placement. Thaler then assumed the role of sole band manager. The band spent the fall of 1989 and most of 1990 on a massive world tour, the band's biggest to that point. It was a major financial success but left the band feeling burnt out. In April 1990, Lee suffered a concussion during a mishap involving a rappelling drum kit stunt during a live concert in New Haven, Connecticut. On October 1, 1991, the band's first compilation album, Decade of Decadence 81–91, was released. It peaked at No.2 on the Billboard 200 album chart. It was reportedly designed as ""just something for the fans"" while the band worked on the next ""all new"" album. Vince Neil left the band in February 1992 following the release of Decade of Decadence, during a period in which most other prominent glam metal bands of the 1980s were breaking up or otherwise seeing their popularity decline significantly amid the advent of grunge and alternative music. It remains unclear whether Neil was fired or quit the band. Sixx has long maintained that Neil quit, while Neil insists that he was fired. ""Any band has its little spats,"" Neil observed in 2000, ""and this one basically just stemmed from a bunch of 'fuck yous' in a rehearsal studio. It went from 'I quit' to 'You're fired' ... It was handled idiotically. The management just let one of the biggest bands in the world break up."" In the running for the vacant frontman position was Kik Tracee vocalist Stephen Shareaux. Ultimately Neil was replaced by John Corabi (formerly of Angora and the Scream). Although Mötley's self-titled March 1994 release made the Billboard top ten (#7), the album was a commercial failure. It also prompted negative reactions from many fans due to Neil's absence and its sound. Corabi suggested the band bring back Neil, believing the latter would always be seen as the voice of the band. This eventually resulted in his own firing in 1996. Corabi spoke about his time with the band and his thoughts on the first record with Mötley Crüe. Corabi said: ""my record was the first record that they had done that didn't go platinum, didn't make some sort of crazy noise, and everybody panicked"". During his time away from the band, Neil released a moderately successful solo album, Exposed in 1993, and a less commercially successful follow-up, Carved in Stone in 1995. After Rolling Stone magazine broke out the news in their November 26 1996 issue, the band reunited with Neil in 1997, after their current manager, Allen Kovac, and Neil's manager, Bert Stein, set up a meeting between Neil, Lee, and Sixx. Agreeing to ""leave their egos at the door"", the band released Generation Swine. Although it debuted at No.4, and in spite of a live performance at the American Music Awards, the album was a commercial failure, due in part to lack of support from their label. In 1998, Mötley's contractual ties with Elektra had expired, putting the band in total control of their future, including the ownership of the master recordings of all of their albums. Announcing the end of their relationship with Elektra, the band became one of the few groups to own and control their publishing and music catalog. They are one of only a handful of artists to own the masters to their material and reportedly did so by being the biggest pain they could be until Elektra got fed up and handed over the rights in order to get the band off their label. After leaving Elektra the band created their own label, Mötley Records. Mötley released their compilation Greatest Hits in late 1998, featuring two new songs, ""Bitter Pill"" and ""Enslaved"". In 1999, the band rereleased all their albums, dubbed as ""Crücial Crüe"". These limited-edition digital remasters included demos, plus live, instrumental, and previously unreleased tracks. In 1999 the band also released Supersonic and Demonic Relics, an updated version of Decade of Decadence featuring the original songs from that album and several previously unreleased B-sides and remixes, as well as their first official live album Entertainment or Death (which was the original working title for the studio album Theatre of Pain). The band then went on a co-headlining tour with The Scorpions. In 1999, Lee quit to pursue a solo career, due to increasing tensions with Neil. ""All we got was a call from his attorney saying he wasn't coming back,"" recalled the singer. ""He wasn't into rock 'n' roll anymore. He even said that rock is dead ... It all happened during a void in Mötley. We weren't even rehearsing, so it was no big deal."" Lee was replaced by a longtime friend of the band, former Ozzy Osbourne drummer Randy Castillo. The band released New Tattoo in July 2000. Before the ensuing tour commenced, Castillo became ill with a duodenal ulcer. The band brought in former Hole drummer Samantha Maloney for the Maximum Rock tour with Megadeth as Castillo concentrated on his health. However, while Castillo was recovering from stomach surgery, he was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma after finding a tumor on his jaw. He died on March 26, 2002. Soon afterward, the band went on hiatus. While the band was on hiatus, Sixx played in side projects 58 and Brides of Destruction. Neil was featured on the first season of VH1's reality show The Surreal Life, and had his own special titled ""Remaking Vince Neil"", which focused on his solo career and attempts to get in better physical shape. Mars, who suffers from a hereditary form of arthritis which causes extensive spinal pain called ankylosing spondylitis, went into seclusion in 2001 dealing with health issues. Lee went on to form Methods of Mayhem and also performed as a solo artist during this time. A 2001 autobiography titled The Dirt, co-authored by all four of the band members and Neil Strauss, presented Mötley as ""the world's most notorious rock band"". The book made the top ten on The New York Times Best Seller list and spent ten weeks there, and would return to the list after the film adaptation was released in spring 2019. In 2003, the band released two box sets entitled Music to Crash Your Car To: Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, featuring the music from their entire career. The titles of the collections were heavily criticized by Hanoi Rocks singer Michael Monroe, among others, due to their possible reference to Vince Neil and Razzle's fatal automobile accident, and that Neil was found guilty of manslaughter for the incident. A promoter in England, Mags Revell, began clamoring for a Mötley Crüe reunion, ostensibly presenting himself as the voice of anxious fans waiting for more from the band. After meeting with management several times, in September 2004, Sixx announced that he and Neil had returned to the studio and had begun recording new material. In December 2004, the four original members announced a reunion tour, staging an announcement event in which they arrived at the Hollywood Palladium in a hearse. The tour began on February 14, 2005, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The resulting compilation album, Red, White & Crüe, was released in February 2005. It features the band members' favorite original songs plus three new tracks, ""If I Die Tomorrow"", ""Sick Love Song"" (co-written by Sixx and James Michael), and a cover of the Rolling Stones' classic ""Street Fighting Man"". A small controversy was caused when it was suggested that neither Lee nor Mars played on the new tracks (duties were supposedly handled by Vandals drummer Josh Freese). However, a VH1 documentary of the band's reunion later showed that Lee did indeed play on some of the tracks. The Japanese release of Red, White & Crüe includes an extra new track titled ""I'm a Liar (and That's the Truth)"". Red, White & Crüe charted at No.6 and has since gone platinum. On New Year's Eve 2004 the band appeared on a live episode of The Tonight Show. Neil yelled an obscenity during the performance, leading to an FCC investigation. The NBC network responded by banning the band, leading to the band subsequently suing the network, claiming they were being unfairly punished. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court and the band made several subsequent appearances on the network. In 2005, Mötley Crüe was involved in an animation-comedy spoof Disaster!, which was written by Paul Benson and Matt Sullivan and which was used as the introduction film to concerts on their Carnival of Sins tour. That tour continued throughout 2005 and was commemorated with the release of a live album and DVD in 2006. In the fall of 2005 the band re-recorded ""Home Sweet Home"" as a duet with Linkin Park lead singer Chester Bennington and donated the proceeds to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. In 2006, Mötley Crüe went on the Route of All Evil Tour, co-headlining with Aerosmith and taking performers from Lucent Dossier Experience on the road with them. 2006 also saw the band sign with Paramount Pictures and MTV Films to adapt their autobiography The Dirt into a movie, but the production was delayed for several years and the deal eventually fell through. In June 2007, Mötley Crüe set out on a small European tour. A lawsuit was filed by Neil, Mars and Sixx against Carl Stubner, Lee's manager. The three sued him for contracting for Lee to appear on two unsuccessful reality shows the band claim hurt its image. It was later reported on Motley.com that the lawsuit had been settled. In 2007, Sixx published his diaries as the bestselling autobiography The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star, covering the band's Girls, Girls, Girls world tour and his 1987 overdose, and Sixx's side project band Sixx:A.M. released The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack as a musical parallel to the novel. The band hosted the Motley Cruise from January 24 to 28 in 2008; this featured Ratt, Skid Row and Slaughter. On June 11, 2008, Mötley Crüe and manager Burt Stein filed suit against each other. Stein was Neil's personal manager and also, according to the band and rival manager Kovac, served as the band's manager at one time. The band and Kovac sued in Los Angeles County Superior Court, claiming Stein was not entitled to a cut of Mötley Crüe's earnings. Stein sued the same day in Nashville's federal court, saying he was entitled to 1.875 percent of what the band makes. Other litigation between the parties also ensued in Nevada. In July 2009, lawyers for both sides announced that the disputes had been ""amicably resolved"" through a ""global settlement"". Mötley Crüe's ninth studio album, titled Saints of Los Angeles, was released in Japan on June 17, 2008, and in America on June 24, 2008. The album was originally titled The Dirt, as it was loosely based on the band's autobiography of the same name, but the title was later changed. In the US, the album was released by Eleven Seven Music. Eleven Seven also took over US distribution of their back catalog. iTunes picked ""Saints of Los Angeles"" in their ""Best of 2008"" in the Rock category as the number one song. The song was also nominated for a Grammy Award in the ""Best Hard Rock Performance"" category, but lost to ""Wax Simulacra"" by The Mars Volta. The song was released in the music game series Rock Band as downloadable content the day the single was released. It was briefly sold as a Rock Band exclusive, making Mötley Crüe the first band to release a single exclusively through a video game. The song sold more units via Rock Band than it did via traditional streaming sites. Additionally, the entire Dr. Feelgood album was released as downloadable content in Rock Band, excluding ""T.n.T. (Terror 'n Tinseltown)"". From July 1 to August 31, 2008, Mötley Crüe headlined the popular Crüe Fest music festival, which included opening acts Buckcherry, Papa Roach, Trapt, and Sixx:A.M. They then spent the fall and winter of that year on tour with Hinder, Theory of a Deadman and The Last Vegas. The band made a guest appearance in the fourth season finale of the FOX crime dramedy Bones on May 14, 2009, entitled ""The End in the Beginning"", performing the song ""Dr. Feelgood"". The following month they performed at the Download Festival at the Donington Park motorsports circuit (June 12–14, 2009), playing on the second stage on Friday night. Mötley Crüe headlined the Crüe Fest 2 festival, which ran from July to September 2009. Supporting them were Godsmack, Theory of a Deadman, Drowning Pool, and Charm City Devils. The band's set celebrated the 20th anniversary of Dr. Feelgood by performing the album in its entirety on each night of the tour. They also re-released the album as a special 20th anniversary deluxe edition. Mötley Crüe headlined Ozzfest in 2010, along with Ozzy Osbourne and Rob Halford. Neil also released his third solo album and autobiography, both entitled Tattoos and Tequila. Mötley Crüe co-headlined a mid-year tour with Poison and special guests New York Dolls in 2011 for the band's 30th Anniversary and Poison's 25th anniversary. On August 30, 2011, Mötley Crüe, along with co-headliners Def Leppard and special guests Steel Panther, announced a UK Tour commencing in December 2011. In February 2012 the band appeared along with supermodel Adriana Lima in a commercial for the Kia Optima, which premiered during Super Bowl XLVI. February 2012 also saw the band host its first residency at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. In March 2012, Mötley Crüe announced a co-headlining tour with Kiss. The tour kicked off July 20 in Bristow, Virginia, and ran through September 23. In the spring and summer of 2013 the band toured throughout Canada with Big Wreck. The band returned to Las Vegas for a second residency in the fall of 2013. On January 28, 2014, at the conference inside Beacher's Madhouse Theater in Hollywood, Mötley Crüe announced the full details of its retirement, including a tour initially spanning 70 North American dates, with Alice Cooper playing as a special guest. The tour commenced in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on July 2, 2014. The band members had signed a ""cessation of touring agreement"", which prevented them from touring under the Mötley Crüe name beyond the end of 2015. In a later interview, Sixx talked about the possibility of releasing new music, saying that ""We have music written,  it's not put together yet"". He also speculated that the band would release it in a song-by-song format as opposed to a full-length album format, elaborating with ""It's hard, to be honest with you, to spend six  nine months to write eleven songs—all those lyrics ... everything ... the vocals, the guitars, the bass, the sonics, the mixing, the mastering, the artwork. ... You put it out and nothing , because now people cherry-pick songs. So we go, 'Why don't we write songs and find vehicles to get one, two or four songs to ten million people rather than eleven songs to a hundred thousand people."" During the tour the band played a new song, ""All Bad Things"", over the speakers throughout the venue before it took the stage. On November 22, 2014, in Spokane, Washington, at the Spokane Arena, Mötley Crüe played the final concert of the first North American leg of The Final Tour. On January 15, 2015, it was announced that the band's career would end with international concerts in Japan, Australia, Brazil and Europe before heading out for a second leg of North American concerts throughout 2015, ending with a concert at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on December 27, followed by three concerts at Staples Center on December 28, 30 and 31, 2015. In May 2015, The Crüe and Alice Cooper announced a set of 12 concert dates for Europe at a conference in London. On September 19, 2015, the band played the Rock in Rio festival on the main stage. Mötley Crüe performed, for what was then advertised to be the last time, at Staples Center in Los Angeles on December 31, 2015. The band reported that its New Year's Eve show was going to be released as a film in 2016; the movie was titled Motley Crue: THE END. In 2017, frontman Vince Neil told host Sammy Hagar on the show Rock and Roll Road Trip that Mötley Crüe were ""completely done"". However, on September 13, 2018, Neil announced via Twitter that Mötley Crüe was recording four new songs; this was later also confirmed by bassist Nikki Sixx, who said that the new material was recorded for the film adaptation of the band's biography, The Dirt. Neil also clarified that, though the band has signed a contract to no longer tour, they still plan to continue putting out new music for the future. Netflix released The Dirt biopic based on the book of the same name that coincided with an 18-song soundtrack on March 22, 2019. The film is directed by Jeff Tremaine, (Jackass), produced by Julie Yorn and Erik Olsen, executive produced by Rick Yorn, and co-produced by Kovac who is Mötley Crüe's manager, CEO of Eleven Seven Label Group and founder of Tenth Street Entertainment. The Dirt stars Daniel Webber as Neil, Iwan Rheon (Game of Thrones) as Mars, Douglas Booth as Sixx and Colson Baker (aka Machine Gun Kelly) as Lee. Also starring in the movie is Pete Davidson (Saturday Night Live) as record executive Tom Zutaut. Rolling Stone wrote that The Dirt is ""a truly debauched movie that delves deep into their rise from the early Eighties Sunset Strip metal scene to their days as arena headliners."" The film portrays many of the adventures the band went on including touring with Ozzy Osbourne and the Theatre of Pain tour. The first new song from the soundtrack was ""The Dirt (Est.1981)"", which was released on February 22, 2019. The band wrote two other new songs, ""Ride With the Devil"" and ""Crash and Burn"", and covered Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"", on the album. The soundtrack additionally included fourteen previously released Mötley Crüe songs. It was produced by Bob Rock, who produced Dr. Feelgood, and was released on March 22, 2019, on Mötley Records and Eleven Seven Music. The soundtrack hit the Billboard Top 10 at No. 10, the first time Mötley Crüe hit the Billboard Top 10 in over a decade. The group's legacy was also featured on a 2019 episode of the Reelz documentary series Breaking the Band. Both Neil and Sixx had a negative reaction to how things were portrayed in the episode. Sixx said they would be pursuing legal action and called Reelz ""the bottom of the barrel"". In November 2019, rumors started to circulate of the band reuniting for a 2020 tour with Def Leppard and Poison, following the success of Guns N' Roses' reunion tour. The band responded to an online petition rallying for the group's return, saying ""this is interesting..."". On November 18, Rolling Stone magazine reported that all four band members had agreed to come back together for the tour, utilizing a loophole in their ""Cessation of Touring"" contract. Later that same day, the band confirmed all reports with a statement on their website, posting a press release and a video of the contract being destroyed. On December 4, 2019, it was officially confirmed that Mötley Crüe would embark on The Stadium Tour with Def Leppard, Poison and Joan Jett & the Blackhearts in the summer of 2020. Also in December 2019 Mick Mars announced that his debut solo album would be released in the spring of 2020. On June 1, 2020, Mötley Crüe announced that The Stadium Tour would be rescheduled to June–September 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it was postponed once again to 2022, due to similar circumstances amid the pandemic. In January 2022, in the wake of the Omicron variant surge, Sixx was asked by a fan on Twitter if The Stadium Tour was still happening this year; his response was, ""We're 1000% hitting the road with Def Leppard for The Stadium Tour in mid-June...I can't f'ckin wait..."" Just prior to the start of the tour, Def Leppard guitarist Phil Collen announced that Mötley Crüe had ""signed up"" for another tour together in Europe, which is slated to take place in 2023; this claim was later confirmed by Def Leppard frontman Joe Elliott. In November 2021, Mötley Crüe sold their entire back catalogue to BMG Rights Management. In September 2022, Neil announced in an interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the band would return for a US tour in 2023. In that same interview, he also ruled out the possibility of further studio albums, stating that they were ""strictly a touring band"". On October 26, 2022, Mick Mars retired as a touring member of the band due to ongoing health issues, according to a statement released by Mars' publicist. The next day, the band confirmed that John 5 would take Mars' place as their new touring guitarist, although he was later confirmed as a member of the band in April 2023. In a December interview with A Radio Rock in Brazil, Sixx confirmed that the band is not going away anytime soon, and stated that the band will be touring for eight more years. On April 6, 2023, Mars sued the band, alleging that they were trying to remove him. In response to the lawsuit, the band issued a statement on the same day, denying that they had fired Mars, and that while he was still a member, had quit touring. On April 19, 2023, the band announced that they are working on new music with record producer Bob Rock, ruling out the possibility of the band working with Mick Mars again. Sixx later released a statement on the upcoming album on May 15, 2023, stating that it had finished production and had begun mixing the album. In June 2023, Neil confirmed that the band is set to perform another stadium tour in 2024. In July 2023, Neil confirmed that the band recorded three brand new songs. In September 2023, John 5 confirmed the title of a new song as ""Dogs of War"". He also said that the band recorded a cover of ""(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (to Party!)"" by Beastie Boys. Often clashing during the early 1980s, both bands were fighting for dominance in the Los Angeles rock scene during Metallica's primitive years prior to their relocation to the Bay Area. Both singerguitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich expressed their hatred of the hair metal scene in Los Angeles during the time and frequently attacked multiple up-and-coming local bands in multiple interviews, including Mötley Crüe. Allegedly before a show in 1982, Ulrich claimed he drunkenly screamed ""Fuck Mötley Crüe!"" at the band from outside the Troubadour in Hollywood, in which Sixx chased Ulrich in retaliation. Former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine during a 1983 interview had also taken aim at the band by claiming Crüe and glam metal were an abbreviation for ""Gay LA Music"". Though despite their public disdain for glam metal, Metallica were impressed by the production and commercial success of Dr. Feelgood in 1989, later hiring the album's producer Bob Rock to produce their self-titled fifth album in 1991. Several years later; both Sixx and Ulrich would reignite the animosity after Ulrich accused Mötley Crüe of performing to a backing track at the 1997 American Music Awards. Sixx responded via an online forum and would also attack Metallica's then-recent album Load insulting multiple members of the band for their change in sound and visual image. During a 2003 interview, Sixx would strangely defend Metallica's then-latest album St. Anger by claiming ""I have learned to have sympathy for the enemy"". In 2006, both Tommy Lee and former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted took part in a reality show entitled Rock Star: Supernova as they would both participate in creating a supergroup while the show's premise revolved around finding a frontman via contest. During a 2011 meet-and-greet in Mexico City, Hetfield was approached by a fan attacking Mötley Crüe due to their public image and frequent appearances in tabloids. Hetfield refused to directly respond to the fan's comments towards Mötley Crüe but did find humor in his insults toward the band. In 2015, Lee would reignite the feud when he posted a Tweet featuring a picture of Ulrich with the words ""Straight Outta Tempo"" superimposed over his face. Lee presumably used a meme maker intended to promote the 2015 N.W.A. biopicStraight Outta Compton. Following the post by Lee, Vince Neil had stated online that he was unaware of the feud with Metallica; however, during a later interview with an Oregon radio show, Neil was again asked about the band's current relationship with Metallica and hung up on the show's host. Things were alleged to have calmed down by 2017, when Hetfield appeared on Sixx's radio show 'Sixx Sense'. During an interview in 2021, Sixx applauded Metallica's longevity and praised several of their releases during an interview. Though Guns N' Roses were initially hired to open for Mötley Crüe during the summer of 1987, things grew hostile between both sides in 1988 after Vince Neil alleged that then-Guns N' Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin had assaulted his then-wife Sharisse at the famed Cathouse club, according to Neil and club owner Riki Rachtman. Things came to a breaking point at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards ironically following Mötley Crüe's presentation for the award of 'Best Metal Video' to Guns N' Roses, however; only bassist Duff McKagan and drummer Steven Adler appeared at the stage to accept the award. Following their performance with Tom Petty, Neil had rushed the side of the stage and threw a punch at Stradlin before being restrained by security. Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose was enraged with the incident, threatening Neil after security had separated the two. During an interview in August 1990, Rose later challenged Neil to a fight during an interview with Kurt Loder, claiming ""Anytime he wants it, Atlantic City; I Don't Care, We'll put money on it."" Neil responded in early 1991 by also challenging Rose to a fight: ""Axl if you are watching this, I want to challenge you to a fight. I'm gonna give you time and I'm gonna give you the place. There's no backing out now buddy. It's time to put up or shut up."", later expressing his intent to possibly host the fight in an arena. Reportedly, Eddie Van Halen and then-current Van Halen singer Sammy Hagar had offered money to possibly host the fight at Madison Square Garden in New York City. However, for unknown reasons, neither Rose or Neil responded to the offer. Neil claims Stradlin had called him with an apology for the incident, but the 1991 Guns N' Roses track ""Shotgun Blues"" was allegedly a diss track aimed at Neil. Tensions were reported to have died down shortly afterwards when both Tommy Lee and former Guns N' Roses guitarist Gilby Clarke participated with former-Metallica bassist Jason Newsted in a reality show entitled Rockstar: Supernova, as they would contribute musical parts in the show's contest to find a vocalist of the newly formed supergroup. Things remained cordial until 2009 when Neil had lobbed insults towards Rose in response to Guns N' Roses' most recent album Chinese Democracy, calling the record a flop and criticizing Rose for his management of the band at the time. In 2014, Revolver magazine honored Rose by calling him 'The World's Greatest Singer', Neil jokingly mocked the award on twitter, but deleted his response shortly afterward. The feud between alternative metal band Godsmack and Mötley Crüe stems from the two sides clashing after Godsmack was hired as one of several supporting acts for Mötley Crüe during the band's 2009 Crüe Fest 2 tour. Godsmack frontman Sully Erna and drummer Shannon Larkin have claimed the feud originated from Mötley Crüe's treatment of the support bands on tour, particularly Godsmack's fans who allegedly often left venues early following their own performance. Larkin recalls in a 2011 interview with Loudwire: ""Mötley Crüe's security were real weird with our guests getting backstage, like our guests might want to look at Mötley Crüe. Our guests were there to see us and they didn't care a shit about Mötley Crüe. Mötley Crüe is a legendary band that we all respect. When I was 17, I had 'Shout at the Devil' but it just kind of fronted us a little that they would think that our guests would be star-struck over them. So, that's where the bad blood came from."". Sully Erna allegedly penned the 2010 track ""Cryin' Like a Bitch"" about Sixx in regards to his behavior towards Godsmack during the tour, though Shannon Larkin claims the song was written about former San Diego Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers. Sixx continued in a war of insults with the band as he alleged that Godsmack had asked to appear on his radio show multiple times, due to initial allegations of it being written as a diss track aimed at Sixx. During a 2015 appearance on the 'Jasta Show' hosted by Hatebreed frontman Jamey Jasta, Erna would attack Sixx further by calling Sixx an 'Old, Fat, Washed-Up Has-Been'. Erna continued the tirade by even challenging Sixx to a fight, claiming: ""I'll say it straight out: I've never met a bigger fucking dick in my life than Nikki Sixx. He's a douchebag. He's straight-up a fucking douche, and I don't give a fuck what he says. He knows exactly where I am, and he knows exactly how he can find me anytime that motherfucker has the balls to come and look me up. Following the interview; Sixx responded to Erna's comments on a Facebook livestream, calling him a baby. Sixx would also claim the band would refuse any future festival dates if they were booked on the same bill as Godsmack. The comedic glam metal band Steel Panther engaged in a feud with Mötley Crüe following a tour between the two bands and Def Leppard in 2011. Numerous members of Steel Panther claim they were heavily influenced by Mötley Crüe's music, however; touring with the band exhibited a hostile environment, particularly from Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee. In the years following the tour, guitarist Satchel claimed Tommy Lee had been rather hostile towards multiple band members due to allegations that he and singer Michael Starr had sex with Lee's girlfriend at the time. Starr also commented on Mötley Crüe's other feud with Godsmack, claiming Sully Erna would severely beat Sixx in a fistfight. In a 2015 interview, Starr would claim the members of Mötley Crüe take themselves too seriously given the comedic nature of Steel Panther's music. Sixx would respond in 2016 claiming he prioritized taking his musical contributions much more seriously. During a 2018 interview, Satchel claimed ""There are bands that hate our guts... We did a tour a few years ago with Def Leppard and Mötley Crüe"". Things escalated in 2019 when drummer Stix Zadinia and Starr appeared in a video on the channel 'Little Punk People' where the two were asked which dead musicians they could revive; Starr jokingly claimed he wanted to bring back Vince Neil from the 1980s, enraging Sixx who later attacked Starr on twitter for his comment. Shortly following the response from Sixx, Steel Panther's band account replied with an interview Mötley Crüe gave from 1994 (whilst Neil was not a part of the band), in which Sixx and guitarist Mick Mars mocked and joked at Neil's weight following a jet ski accident. Though Mötley Crüe would not respond to the post, multiple band members of Steel Panther have praised Mötley Crüe's music as influential in multiple interviews afterwards. On October 27, 2022, co-founding guitarist Mick Mars publicly announced his retirement from touring with the band after nearly 42 years due to complications with ankylosing spondylitis, a degenerative form of inflammatory arthritis leaving him unable to perform on tour. Shortly afterwards, the band announced longtime Rob Zombie guitarist John 5 would be his replacement during the ongoing tour. In an interview with Ultimate Guitar dated March 13, 2023, Carmine Appice, a friend of Mars', claimed that Mars, in addition to his declining health, had lost enjoyment for touring . Enraged with the comments, Nikki Sixx responded on twitter; attacking Appice, referring to him as 'a washed up drummer'. Following Sixx's comments; Mars would begin to attack the band during an interview with Variety published April 6, 2023, claiming the band's severance payout was 'laughable' as his royalties had allegedly been cut to 7.5% as a result of his retirement. Mars further claimed he was forced to retire as opposed to being fired by the band based on their own displeasure with his medical ailments. On April 7, 2023, Mars publicly filed a lawsuit against Mötley Crüe in the Los Angeles County Superior Court for unpaid royalties, claiming the band had severely cut his touring royalty agreement from 25% to 5% as a direct result of his retirement. The band's representative Sasha Frid had revealed claims that a 2008 legal agreement signed by all four band members had documented that no resigning participants would receive the same compensation attributable to live performances or merchandise sales if a particular member had chosen to quit the band. Mars' attorney Ed McPherson publicly attacked the band in a statement due to their failure to reveal updated financial documents in regards to Mars' payout agreement following his retirement in October. According to Mars' accounts in the lawsuit; he claims that the band had also forced him to sell off his remaining share in the band, labeling their behavior as 'bullying'. Nikki Sixx would make a public statement on twitter expressing his disappointment with the lawsuit but offered his public support for Mars nonetheless. Following this statement Mars would further attack the band in a Variety article, taking aim at Lee and Neil for their previous legal incidents and alleged the band had been performing with a backing track throughout the tour. During an interview with Rolling Stone on July 3, 2023; Mars elaborated further by claiming he has refused to speak with any members of the band ever again, stating his intention to pursue his full royalty percentage. As of September 2023, the matter remained in litigation. Following the firing of Vince Neil in 1992, Mötley Crüe would hire John Corabi as their new lead singer prior to the recording of their 1994 self-titled album. Fan reactions were mixed due to the uncharted nature of the band's change in sound with Corabi, in addition to their new stylistic direction of the 1990s. As the band began writing for their upcoming seventh album Generation Swine, tensions over the album's creative direction began to surface between the band and Corabi. Corabi blamed much of the poor songwriting and production on Nikki Sixx's leadership while Sixx blamed Corabi for being unable to write songs fluidly. The band had previously hired new manager Allen Kovac in 1994 prior to the release of the self-titled album, however the mixed response to the record in addition to backlash towards Corabi from longtime fans proved to be strenuous on the band's public image, resulting in the band firing Corabi during the recording process of Generation Swine. The band were forced by management and fan responses to rehire Neil, however; tensions with Corabi remained high for multiple years following the split. Corabi would later sue the band in 1997 due to removal of his songwriting credits on the album. Despite the tensions; Corabi took part in a short-lived supergroup with Sixx entitled Brides of Destruction with L.A. Guns guitarist Tracii Guns in 2003. Corabi later outlined his tensions with Sixx would resurface during the project and would attack Sixx during multiple public interviews for his poor leadership and even insulted his playing abilities. Following guitarist Mick Mars' lawsuit against the band in 2023, Corabi expressed his support for Mars while criticizing the band's poor financial decisions. Mötley Crüe's musical style is most commonly described as heavy metal, glam metal, and hard rock. According to AllMusic, the band has ""a knack for melding pop hooks to heavy metal theatrics."" The band changed to a more alternative metal and grunge sound on Mötley Crüe (1994) and industrial rock on Generation Swine (1997). Music critic Martin Popoff's book The Top 500 Heavy Metal Songs of All Time lists seven of the band's songs in its ranking. Mötley Crüe was ranked tenth on MTV's list of ""Top 10 Heavy Metal Bands of All-Time"" and ninth on ""VH1's All Time Top Ten Metal Bands"". Music website Loudwire named the band the 22nd greatest metal band of all time. Spin named Shout at the Devil the 11th best metal album of all time. In 2013 LA Weekly named the band the 3rd best ""hair metal"" band of all time. Rolling Stone named Too Fast For Love the 22nd best metal album of all time. In 2006, the band received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2014, the tribute album Nashville Outlaws was released, featuring country music stars including Rascal Flatts, LeAnn Rimes and Darius Rucker covering various Mötley Crüe songs. The album debuted at number 2 on the Billboard Country Album chart and number 5 on the Billboard 200.

"In the fishery business, a bycatch reduction device is a tool designed to minimize unintended capture of marine animals, to reduce the adverse effects of fishing on the ecosystem. To minimize accidental capture of marine animals, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) fisheries developed and tested bycatch reduction devices (BRDs). These devices are openings in shrimp trawl nets that allow finfish or other unwanted aquatic animals to escape, while the target species, shrimp, is directed towards the tail bag or cod end of the net. The placement and design have been developed in conjunction with normal bottom trawling practices, using trawl nets outfitted with a turtle excluder device. BRDs are required in shrimp trawl nets working in the federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic regions. A pulsed electric field-based shark and ray bycatch mitigation device, SharkGuard, was reported to have reduced bycatch of blue shark by 91% and of stingrays by 71% with commercial fishing gear in a French longline tuna fishery in the Mediterranean. Officially, National Standard 9 was added to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act in 1996 to address the need to control the magnitude of bycatching. The standard mandates minimizing bycatch to the extent practicable and minimizing mortality of unavoidable bycatch. Congress increased requirements to protect this harvest in the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act. In response to these mandates, NOAA Fisheries (National Marine Fisheries Service) developed an ongoing by-catch plan and published Amendment 10 to the Fisheries Management Plan of the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Management Council. In conjunction with the plan, NOAA fisheries and other agencies collect data in order to monitor the extent and type of bycatch in all U.S. fishery regions. The associated research plan for the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic fisheries is available online. A portion of the Sea Grant website is dedicated to providing information and an archive of articles about the conservation efforts of commercial shrimpers associated with the use of BRDs in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic regions. Between 1990 and 1996, research in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic shrimp trawl fisheries examined the proportions of catch and bycatch by weight. The data indicated that catches in the Gulf consisted of about 67 percent finned fish, 16 percent commercial shrimp, 13 percent non-commercial shrimp, and 4 percent other invertebrates. In the South Atlantic, the catch averaged 51 percent finned fish, 18 percent commercial shrimp, 13 percent non-commercial shrimp and crustaceans, and 18 percent non-crustacean invertebrates (by weight). After insertion of various types of BRDs in the shrimp trawl nets, significant reductions were noted for Spanish mackerel, weakfish, croakers and spot in the South Atlantic region and for Atlantic croakers, king mackerel, Spanish mackerel and red snapper in the Gulf region. Red snapper conservation is one of the primary reasons for interest in BRDs by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. During 1997 and 1998, trawls in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic regions were required to insert and use a BRD in their nets. This device is installed in the cod end of a shrimp trawl for the purpose of excluding finfish from the net. Since then, NOAA fisheries have certified three types of BRDs for use in the Gulf of Mexico region: the Gulf Fisheye, the Jones-Davis, and the Fisheye BRDs; and five for the south Atlantic region: the Extended Funnel, Expanded Mesh, Fisheye, Gulf Fisheye and Jones-Davis BRDs. According to research conducted during 2003-2004, the Extended Funnel BRD and an Expanded Mesh BRD were found to be successful in the South Atlantic, while the 12” by 5” Fisheye BRD was considered successful in both South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico waters. These conclusions are subject to continuing research.",Normal
"Nickesse Trimaine Toney (March 13, 1990 – September 2, 2014), known by his stage name Nicky Da B, was an American rapper specializing in the regional genre of bounce music. He released an album in 2012 titled Please Don't Forget Da B, and his single with the artist Diplo that year, Express Yourself, was one of the year's largest viral successes, featuring in a Doritos commercial during Super Bowl XLVII. He was also known for his role in popularizing the dance phenomenon of twerking. Nicky da B was born in 1990 in New Orleans, Louisiana in a section of the Carrollton neighborhood known as Pigeon Town, in the city's 17th ward. He was raised by his mother Nicole Toney and grandmother Aline Toney. Nicky graduated in 2008 from West Jefferson High School and attended Delgado Community College. Nicky began writing rap lyrics at age 6 under the name ""Lil Fiya"" in admiration of the Hot Boys. At 14, he began rapping himself. Nicky had close ties with Katey Red, who he called his ""gay mother"". Big Freedia was also a major influence and friend to Nicky Da B, and the two worked together to gain exposure for bounce music. Nicky was a former HHG (Hitt'em Hard Guy) and twerk dancer for Sissy Nobby before he branched out and became a solo artist. In 2011 he released the local hit ""Drop It Hot Potato Style"" and began touring. Nicky was outspoken about his passion for creating music for the LGBT community, which he identified with. After releasing his album Please Don't Forget da B in 2012, he embarked on a world tour, which included a sold-out show at the Sydney Opera House. In July 2014, he collaborated with German dance-music duo Schlachthofbronx on the single, ""Lights Off"". On September 2, 2014, his death at age 24 due to illness was announced by his manager and live DJ, Rusty Lazer. The family later asked for help from fans in paying for his funeral, which included a parade led by the TBC Brass Band in his Carrollton neighborhood.",Normal
"Silene tomentosa, the Gibraltar campion, is a very rare flowering plant of the genus Silene and the family Caryophyllaceae. It is a woody-based perennial about 40cm high, with bilobed flowers ranging from pink to pale violet and is endemic to Gibraltar. Although the scientific community outside Gibraltar already thought Silene tomentosa to be extinct, the Gibraltar Ornithological & Natural History Society's botanical section knew it was still around in 1985, but by 1992 they also considered it to be extinct. It was later re-discovered in 1994, when it was found growing in the Upper Rock Nature Reserve. Following this re-discovery, it was propagated at the Millennium Seed Bank and the type specimen is kept at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London. Using knowledge gained from this process, other plants have been successfully reintroduced into the Upper Rock Nature Reserve on the Rock of Gibraltar. Silene tomentosa is protected by the law of Gibraltar under the Nature Protection Act, 1991. Silene tomentosa is currently found growing wild only on the rocky outcrops of the Rock of Gibraltar. Specimens are also grown at Gibraltar Botanic Gardens.",Normal

"St Saviour's War Memorial is a war memorial on Borough High Street, in the former parish of Southwark St Saviour, to south of the River Thames in London. It became a Grade II listed building in 1998 and was upgraded to Grade II* in 2018. The memorial includes a bronze sculpture by Philip Lindsey Clark. He had enlisted as a private in the Artists' Rifles in 1914, and was commissioned in the 11th (Service) (1st South Down) Battalion of the Royal Sussex Regiment in 1916, ending the war as a captain with a DSO. The figure is similar to one of three included in his Cameronians War Memorial in Glasgow, unveiled in 1924: an infantryman in battledress advancing, carrying a rifle with attached bayonet slung over his shoulder. In the Cameronians Memorial, the figure advances with the rifle held in the right hand. The bronzes for both memorials were cast by the Maneti foundry in London. A similar sculpture of an infantryman with rifle was used by Albert Toft for the Royal Fusiliers War Memorial in Holborn. The statue stands on a high Portland stone pedestal with rounded ends. On its long sides are bronze reliefs: one with biplanes, to the west, and another with battleships, to the east. On one side below the biplanes plaque is the inscription ""Give honour to the men of St. Saviours Southwark who gave their lives for the empire 1914–1918. Their names are inscribed within the parish church. May their memory live for ever in the minds of men."" and on the other side below the battleships plaque is the inscription ""This memorial was erected by the parishioners of Saint Saviour's Southwark in the year 1922."" A model of the main figure was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1923. The ends of the pedestal are decorated with stone carvings of Saint George and the Dragon to the front (south), and a carving of a mourning woman with child and dove to the rear (north). The memorial was funded by public subscription, and the design was chosen by a competition. The £4,000 raised also allowed a bronze memorial plaque by Sir John Ninian Comper to be erected in Southwark Cathedral naming 344 war dead from the parish, also cast by Maneti. Both memorials were unveiled on 16 November 1922 by General Henry Horne, 1st Baron Horne, and dedicated on the same day by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich, William Hough. It was dismantled, restored and rebuilt in 2013, and rededicated in 2014 by the Dean of Southwark, Andrew Nunn. 51°30′15″N 0°05′27″W﻿ ﻿51.50426°N 0.09089°W﻿ 51.50426; -0.09089",Normal

"ARCH+ is a quarterly German magazine for architecture, urbanism, and design that was established in 1967. The magazine has been praised by a number of different architects and publications. A group of architecture students and junior faculty from the University of Stuttgart established ARCH+ in 1967 and its first issue appeared in January of the following year. Despite forming concurrent to the student protest movement of 1968, the magazine's content was not explicitly political in its first years. Early issues focused on technocratic aspects of architecture and urbanism, such as planning theory, semiotics, mathematics, and cybernetics. In the early 1970s, growing ideological divides among the publication's contributors led to the establishment of splinter editorial groups in West Berlin and Aachen. A new wave of editors effected a politicization of the magazine, which came to focus increasingly on the sociological issues surrounding the built environment. While this progressive political orientation has stayed with the magazine until today, subsequent decades saw an increase in attention to other aspects of the field, including: aesthetics and postmodernism in the late 1970s, the legacy of the modern movement in the mid-1980s, and high-tech architecture in the 1990s. Since 2000, ARCH+ has expanded its scope of activities to include exhibition design, exhibition catalogs, a lecture and conversation series, research projects, and competitions. In 2010, ARCH+ released one of its first fully bilingual publications, Post-Oil City, which was followed by its first bilingual issue, Think Global, Build Social!, in 2013. The issue also served as a catalog for an eponymous exhibition at the German Architecture Museum in Frankfurt am Main. ARCH+ is one of the largest and oldest periodicals in Germany that focuses on architectural history and theory. Every issue is devoted to a particular subject, place, or theme; recent topics include contemporary Japanese architecture, social housing design, service architecture, and shrinking cities. Contemporary buildings are featured to illustrate the topic, while timelines and reference projects are meant to situate the topic in broader historical and cultural contexts. Issues regularly include long-form essays by academics and architects as well. The Zeitung section of every issue features book and exhibition reviews.",Normal

"Raine Island Beacon is a heritage-listed beacon at the eastern end of Raine Island, Shire of Cook, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1844 by convicts. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. Ships bound north from Australia to Asia generally took the Outer Passage before turning west through the Great Barrier Reef to Torres Strait. As the area was notorious for shipwrecks, the beacon was built in 1844 to assist navigation. The beacon was built mostly of local materials: coral limestone quarried on site; shells burned to make lime for mortar; and timber from the Martha Ridgway which was wrecked nearby in 1842. Though serving as a landmark for shipping and used by crews, the beacon soon became obsolete after the northern passage was discovered. In 1890 the JT Arundel Company began mining guano on Raine Island, with a workforce of 100 Chinese. Their extensive quarries are evident over much of the island, though there is little sign of the former jetty, buildings, tramway and locomotive. The most obvious gravesite, which is marked by a tombstone, is that of Annie Eliza Ellis who died in 1891. No commercial activity is known to have occurred since 1892, though the beacon tower has been used unofficially for conveying messages, as seen in hundreds of inscriptions on the inner walls. Raine Island, with its beacon, quarries and tombstone, remains a principal wildlife habitat, while dominated by the convict-built beacon. Raine Island Beacon is a substantial structure about 12 metres (39ft) high with a base diameter of 9 metres (30ft), and is visible for 13 nautical miles. Constructed of good quality coral limestone trimmed to produce a continuous curve inside and out, its cylindrical form decreases in diameter in four steps upwards and is topped by a crenellated parapet. A lightning conductor of wrought copper is fitted from top to bottom of the east face. The only opening in the walls is a semi-circular arched doorway surmounted by the standard inscription VR and date: 1844. Two inscribed stone plaques inserted into the wall above the keystone are illegible due to erosion. The interior originally comprised three levels of wooden floors which were reached by ladders and topped by a dome of timber ribs covered with canvas. Raine Island Beacon was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Constructed as early as 1844, the Raine Island Beacon served briefly as an aid to navigation and a shelter for shipwrecked sailors, and is one of the oldest and most significant structures remaining in Queensland. Its associations with northern navigation and maritime transport, as well as the penal system and island industry are reflected in the fabric of the structure and site. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. As an early navigation aid built of masonry on an isolated coral cay, the beacon is unique in form and context. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. As an early navigation aid built of masonry on an isolated coral cay, the beacon is unique in form and context. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It remains a landmark structure, and has an aesthetic appeal generated by its rustic materials, early workmanship, derelict nature, and dramatic, isolated ocean setting.

"Chip carving or chip-carving, kerbschnitt in German, is a style of carving in which knives or chisels are used to remove small chips of the material from a flat surface in a single piece. The style became important in Migration Period metalwork, mainly animal style jewellery, where the faceted surfaces created caught the light to give a glinting appearance. This was very probably a transfer to metalworking of a technique already used in woodcarving, but no wooden examples have survived. Famous Anglo-Saxon examples include the jewellery from Sutton Hoo and the Tassilo Chalice, although the style originated in mainland Europe. In later British and Irish metalwork, the same style was imitated using casting, which is often called imitation chip-carving, or sometimes just chip carving (authors are not always careful to distinguish the two), a term also sometimes applied to pottery decorated in a similar way. In modern wood carving, the style is also called spoon carving. The style is traditional in the folk art of many countries. Patterns can be free form style or based on geometric figures. In America it is mostly used with basswood, butternut, pine, or mahogany. Chip carving knives can also be used for whittling, cabinet making, and general workbench purposes.",Normal
"The TCR UK Touring Car Championship, known as the Touring Car Trophy from 2019 to 2021, is a touring car racing series based in the United Kingdom. It features production-based touring cars built to TCR specifications, and formerly also NGTC and Super 2000 specifications from 2019 to 2021. The championship is aimed as a feeder category to the BTCC and operated by Stewart Lines' Maximum Group. The TCR UK Touring Car Championship was first established in 2018 and was organised by the BRSCC. TCR UK was introduced as a feeder series for the more popular and expensive British Touring Car Championship although there was no direct link between the two series'. Interest in the new championship initially appeared high, with organisers discussing the possibility of qualifying races in order to accommodate the projected large grids. However, in reality grid numbers were low throughout the year with only 5 drivers competing at every event and the grid peaking at 13 cars in the season opener at Silverstone. Dan Lloyd took the inaugural championship in dominant fashion, winning 7 of the first 8 races and taking 4 pole positions. The championship continued to struggle in 2019 and a few weeks before the first scheduled round at Snetterton, and with only 3 entries announced, the decision was made to combine the championship with Stewart Lines Touring Car Trophy. Lines would also takeover the running and organisation of the championship. The Touring Car Trophy was established in 2019 for older Super 2000 and NGTC machinery which was no longer eligible for the British Touring Car Championship. TCR UK would now be a class within the Touring Car Trophy with drivers in TCR cars able to fight for two championships. Henry Neal, son of 3 time BTCC champion Matt Neal, won the inaugural Touring Car Trophy driving a NGTC specification Honda Civic Type R while James Turkington, younger brother of another BTCC champion, Colin Turkington, fought off Lewis Kent to win the TCR UK class. For 2020 the Volkswagen Racing Cup also joined the grid. Henry Neal and Lewis Kent dominated the season with Neal defending his title and Kent clinching his first TCR UK class title. In 2021 the championship began to recover with entries reaching double figures for the first time since 2018. By seasons end the grid was entirely made up of TCR cars with Lewis Kent taking his second title ahead of 2020 Civic Cup champion Bruce Winfield. The Touring Car Trophy was dissolved for 2022 with TCR UK once again becoming a standalone championship. The series experienced its biggest season yet with 20 cars appearing at every round and the grid peaking at 25 cars for 3 events.

"Ted Ellis (born 1963) is an American artist and former environmental chemist. Ellis is best known for his African-American themed art and styles which blend elements of folk art, naturalism and impressionism. His personal rendition of Barack Obama in acrylic, Obama, the 44th President, was presented in honor of the 2009 Presidential Inauguration. Ellis' art business has sold over 1.75million fine art products, and he works with a number of prominent corporations. He is also known for his community work, especially advancing arts in children's education. Born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, to a professional musician-father and a housewife-mother, Ted Ellis' earliest hints of artistic talent began to show at five-years-old. Ellis' first attempt at art was a third-grade freehand sketch of a dog from Archie Comics, which he drew so accurately that friends and family believed it had been traced. Growing up, one of his favorite characters to draw was Wile E. Coyote, and as an adult he continues to enjoy comic books as ""refreshing"". When he was old enough, Ted would ride the bus alone to downtown New Orleans so as to be exposed to and spend time with the area artists. He and his friends would in their spare time compete with one another to see who could draw the best designs, and Ted continued developing his art skills throughout primary school despite only receiving ""satisfactory"" marks in art class. In elementary school he attended a summer program at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, and later attended an after-school program at Lawless High School. Ellis says that he knew he wanted to be an artist in the seventh grade, and credits his teacher in that class for keeping him focused. Ted worked for a time with charcoal and pastel before settling on oil and acrylic. He took art classes during high school and enrolled in four months of private art lessons, but is otherwise self-taught. Ellis followed advice from Anna Torregano, his mentor, friend and high school art teacher, and his parents, all of whom advised him to pursue an academic career so as not to become a ""starving artist"".   His mother especially stressed university and earning a professional degree. Ted Ellis earned a B.Sc. in chemistry at Dillard University on a United States Army ROTC scholarship as well as academic scholarship, and went on to be commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army's Field Artillery Branch. Ellis spent the next ten years working in the field of chemistry, eight years of which were as an environmental chemist at Rollins Engineering Services. Ellis has lived in Louisiana and California, and currently resides in Friendswood, Texas with his wife, Erania. They have a daughter, Chaney, and a son, Tanner. Chaney is an aspiring rap artist and has produced a positive, parent-friendly CD about school and drugs titled Off the Chain. Ted Ellis maintained a passion for art that preceded his professional art career; he painted throughout his time in the Army and as an environmental chemist, generally working out of a studio in his garage. His first commissions were produced for two co-workers at Rollins. They had wanted to purchase the piece that he was then working on, but he refused and instead offered to paint them two similar pieces, which they purchased for $40. When he first got started, Ellis passed on an opportunity to do work for the J. C. Penney catalog because he was too busy, but ultimately found success in a similar publication. Ellis published his first prints through Market Arts' Dan Rose in Houston, but his art career took off when he noticed that his wife's Avon boutique magazine, targeted at African-Americans, lacked any art. He sent Avon a proposal which they accepted, and through the magazine he sold 42,610 signed prints of Thee Baptism. Since he was still working as an engineer at the time, he autographed the tens-of-thousands of prints during his lunch-break. After quitting his job as an engineer in 1996, Ellis competed against 500 others for, and won, a 1998 Walt Disney Studios commission for art in honor of Black History Month. The piece was used in the 1999 celebration at Epcot Center and appeared on T-shirts, souvenir-mugs, and posters. An entrepreneurial-minded Ted Ellis has marketed and sold his art throughout his career. He was already monetizing his creative talents in high school when his classmates and he sold their custom designed T-shirts, first to their school's juniors and seniors, and then throughout the school district. In building his art business over two decades, Ellis engaged in fact-finding missions in search of financial patrons and customers at art festivals, conventions, reunions and libraries, as well as local businesses. Ellis incorporated his business in 1991. He credits his time at Rollins for teaching him that ""if you have a quality product and a good form of distribution, you'll succeed"". When he first got started, Ellis quickly realized that talent was not alone enough after he had to approach 30–40 galleries until he was picked up by two, one of which closed down. He says that ""it's a lot of marketing, planning, exhibiting and a lot of rejection"". Ted's wife Erenia, a loan officer, manages his business, ""T. Ellis Art, Incorporated"", out of a League City, Texas studio. Ellis has sold more than 1.75million fine art products across the country through direct sales, art galleries, catalog outlets, fine art dealers, and licensing, and has marketed community partnership opportunities meant to educate and empower communities by offering maximum returns on minimal investments. In 2005 he signed for representation with art licensing agency ""Alaska Momma"" with the intent of opening new merchandising avenues in home décor, furnishings, calendars, apparel and stationery. Ellis has affiliated with and had art commissioned by corporations like Walt Disney Studios, Minute Maid, Coca-Cola, Marathon Oil, ExxonMobil, State Farm Insurance, Merck Pharmaceutical, J. C. Penney, Southland Corporation, and Avon Products, Philip Morris USA and Integrity Music. Ellis' works have been sold through Army and Air Force Exchange Service catalogs and were available exclusively both through Avon's African American Boutique as well as their core brochures. One of his first major sales was of an original depicting a God-like surgeon in an operating-room, sold to the surgeon. Ellis' art has sold for prices ranging from $750 to $30,000. Despite his success, while Ellis initially had hoped to build his business up to Fortune 500 stature, he now finds satisfaction in ""helping others through art"". Ted Ellis and his wife are both natives of New Orleans, and much of his art along with his passion for art are inspired by the vibrant city. As a young man, he would search the colorful French Quarter for subjects to paint. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the devastation of parts of the city, the city's role in his art drastically changed so as to reflect the story of hope and rebirth that he saw in the disaster. On the night before the storm hit Louisiana, the Ellis home in Texas was a refuge for 10 New Orleans families, 50 people in all. After the storm, Ellis helped fly home friends stranded outside New Orleans, and he organized colleagues in the art community behind the relief effort. Ellis was allowed to enter the city two weeks after the flood waters subsided in order to survey the damage to his mother's home in the Lower Ninth Ward and salvage her possessions. While travelling among the destroyed houses and deserted city, Ellis witnessed a lone man repairing his home's roof. The contrast resonated with Ellis, and he memorialized the hope he saw in the man's actions through his piece Surviving Katrina. The scene is of rising floodwater that traps a family on their house's roof while the father holds up the Flag of the United States, a flag that to Ellis symbolizes the need for the nation to come together to aid those affected by the storm. In Life Begins Anew, a father holds a baby above floodwaters while another man reaches out to take the child. Ellis describes the scene as symbolizing the promise of a new beginning for those who survived Katrina and its aftermath. As its title indicates, the Katrina: The Hope, Healing and Rebirth of New Orleans collection was for Ellis about showing the power of art to assist the healing process: ""The largest piece I did is about how life begins anew and how a person can find hope even after such devastation. I want this work to be uplifting, to be a fresh breath of life for the community."" One of Ted Ellis' more famous works is an abstract depiction of Barack Obama's signature 'hope' pose. Ellis painted the portrait in honor of Obama's 2008 Presidential inauguration. In Obama, the 44th President, Ellis uses red, blue, yellow, and green acrylic paint to portray Obama as someone who unites people across lines of color, ethnicity, and religion. The piece was presented at a January 19, 2009, gala held by the National Black Chamber of Commerce and the National Newspaper Publishers Association Foundation at the Embassy of France in Washington, D.C. The proceeds from the autographed prints sold at the event supported NNPA Foundation and the Howard University School of Communications Building Fund (NNPA Media Wing). In 2009, Ted Ellis produced an exhibit focusing on the theme of African-American history in light of slavery and emancipation. The exhibit, American Slavery: The Reason Why We're Here, tied into the Juneteenth commemoration of slavery's abolition in the State of Texas. It was located at and included tours of the historic residence of horticulturist Henry Stringfellow, an innovator in organic gardening who was enlightened in how he employed of freedmen. Ellis began the series of works at a 2006 exhibition at the same house. The exhibit's more than 20 paintings were painted with brush and fingers, and Ellis sometimes added a collage of documents. The exhibit included images of the transportation of slaves, the industry of slavery in crop production, and the abolition of slavery. The painting Free At Last includes depictions of Buffalo soldiers, Harriet Tubman, the year ""1865"", a mighty oak, and in the background, their heads bowed in prayer, the figures of the current owner and restorer of the house, Sam Collins III, and his wife and children. The exhibit also displayed Ellis' famous depiction of Barack Obama, Obama, the 44th President. Ellis' art was featured at a 2011 exhibition at the Rosa Parks Library and Museum. The Museum, at Troy University in Montgomery, Alabama, hosted the exhibit, called Our History, Heritage, and Culture: An American Story, the Art of Ted Ellis, as part of its celebration of Black History Month. T. Ellis has been pictorially documenting African-American lifestyle, history and culture for thirty years. Ellis paintings are in the permanent collection of the DuSable museum, Charles Wright museum, the McKenna museum, Free People of Color Museum, and the Amistad Research Center. The City of Selma, Alabama, commissioned T. Ellis as the official artist for the 50th anniversary for the civil rights march, known as ""Bloody Sunday"". The City and County of Galveston, Texas, recognized T. Ellis for the 150th anniversary of Juneteenth.

Ted Ellis views education as one of his primary missions, and he is involved with several educational initiatives. He has a run a number of art workshops with children, including drawing and touching up the school mural which local sixth-graders paint every year, and joining with his wife Erania to illustrate while she reads aloud to children from books about topics like the Buffalo Soldiers. When working with children with autism, he employs a strategy of engaging the children's creativity in a non-judgemental setting where there is no wrong way for them to express themselves; he hopes to put their art on display at the Houston Children's Museum. He has partnered with the Tom Joyner Foundation to fund-raise for students, while ""Art with a Purpose"", his own nonprofit program, was awarded a federal grant to help disadvantaged students. Ellis serves together with Gregory Michael Carter as an artist-in-residence for an arts enrichment program at a Galveston, Texas charter school, ""Ambassadors Preparatory Academy"". The program, called ""Ambassadors for Art"", is led by school administrators and members of the community through the Gulf Coast Apollo Chapter of nonprofit volunteer service organization The Links, Incorporated. Ambassadors for Art also took part in painting a bust of US President Barack Obama. The bust was one of 45 painted by artists nationwide which were displayed in Detroit's Museum of African American History, part of a project supported by the Smithsonian Institution. He has also worked with other arts education programs like the Peoria Public Schools' ""Artreach"", in the framework of which he donated five original pieces to the schools and District 150 Foundation. Ted Ellis has over his career created art in a number of styles and has incorporated several primary influences. African American history and African American culture play central roles in Ellis' art, which regularly feature themes like Buffalo Soldiers, cotton fields, and Jazz music; his Jazz works especially lean towards the impressionistic. Other common themes range from fisherman to religious scenes as in Thee Baptism, My Father's Baptism, and Deacon's Door, to African ethnic scenes like Afrimage and Ashanti. The Church-related themes in his art he attributes to formative experiences with his mother at their local house of worship, ""Beulah Land Church"". While he is best known for his ethnic art, many of Ellis' pieces are landscapes, seascapes, and portraits. Ted Ellis is a self-taught artist. He has describes his style at times as ""conventional realism"", as a bold blend of realism and impressionism, and as impressionist and naturalist, an old masters' style that is sometimes figurative and sometimes folk art. ""I try to capture the essence in one stroke"" he said. Ellis has also coined the term ""Tedism"" to describe his style. ""Tedism"" blends impressionism, soul, and folk stories to create representational pieces. Ted Ellis considers himself to be a social, political and spiritual artist as well as educator and ""creative historian"". ""I paint subjects that are representative of the many facets of American life as I know it"" says Ellis. ""I like to think of myself as a creative historian. I was put here to record history...all aspects of American culture and heritage. My sole purpose has always been to educate through my art"". He draws inspiration from people's memories of family or from history, and says that he's ""a history buff at heart. I read a lot, and I have more books than paint."" As an artist who focuses on African American history, Ellis intentionally does not approach its difficult chapters from a position of pain: ""I have to be careful what I do  there's a power to art. I don't want to be from an angry position. That's out there, and maybe they do that to shake you up and make you think. I want to be one step ahead. When you're talking about healing, you're in the right zone."" As such, his images of slavery and historical Southern life focus on positive values such as family, character, and church. Ellis attributes a love for and influence in his art to New Orleans and its rich culture of creativity. He compared the city to an incubator for young talent. The city offered Ted art clubs and opportunities to design murals for school and create signs for special events. New Orleans gave him access to art classes, summer art programs, and the vibrant Jackson Square, somewhere he could talk with and get to know many artists. Ellis' favorite artists include Henry Ossawa Tanner, Edward Bannister, Jacob Lawrence, Samella Lewis, and John T. Scott, while among his work the favorite painting is Sunday Worship. Ted Ellis and his artwork have been widely recognized and honored in many venues. Ellis's art was featured in 1992 and 1993 for Black History Month at the Irving Arts Center in Irving, Texas, near Dallas.

Ellis was the Heritage Arts Festival's winner of the Pallette Award for Impressionism in 2002 In 2005, he was named ""Entrepreneur of the Year"" by the National Black Chamber of Commerce. Amistad Research Center at Tulane University in 2005 recognized Ted Ellis as a historical artist and mounted a week-long exhibition of his paintings in the Audubon Zoo's Tropical Bird House. The exhibit, Reflections of African American Culture: Paintings by Ted Ellis, was co-hosted by the Audubon Nature Institute. A reception held in Uptown New Orleans' Audubon Tea Room included an exhibition of Ted Ellis' works entitled A Celebration of African American Art and Culture: Paintings by Ted Ellis. Ellis donated two of the exhibition's pieces to the center: We Are Americans (2002) and The Struggle Continues (2003). He also chose the center to be the repository for his papers including the yearly donation of a piece of art to his collection there. Ellis featured in a Houston City Council meeting chaired by mayor Bill White where council member Sue Lovell declared May 23, 2006 ""Ted Ellis Day"", citing Ellis' contributions as a leading African American contemporary artist who in his art captures American culture. The Austin, Texas-based George Washington Carver Museum and Cultural Center in 2006 hosted Ellis' exhibition, Say My Name. In 2007, Ellis' work was exhibited at ""Embrace: the Fine Art Fair of the National Black Arts Festival"". In February of that year he was profiled in the ""11th Annual Citywide African American Art Exhibition"" at the Houston Museum of Fine Arts.

Ted Ellis' art has been purchased by celebrities like Bryant Gumbel, Angela Bassett, Johnnie Cochran, Blair Underwood, Susan L. Taylor, Joyce M. Roche, Spike Lee and Brad Pitt. In 2017, T. Ellis received proclamation from The Senate of the State of Texas for his exhibition Pride, Dignity and Courage: celebrating African-American History and Culture"". Ted Ellis is involved with various causes and charitable organizations including United Way, ICLS, African American Visual Arts Association, Jack and Jill of America Inc., the United Negro College Fund, Heritage Christian Academy, and various public school districts. He was the featured artist of Big Brothers Big Sisters 2012 ""Houston's Big Black Tie Ball"" fundraiser gala and is a partner of the Houston Child Protective Services Black History Program. In a column published in Images Magazine, Ted Ellis calls on the younger generations of black artists to recognize the hardship faced by and the effort put in by the previous generation of black artists in order to pave the way for the newer generation to be able to succeed, and to do so with far less difficulty. He says African-American are still not within the mainstream, and despite being the most financially minded black artists yet, that the current generation still earns less than it should. Ellis further assigns partial responsibility on an academic world that he sees as not paying sufficient attention to the genre. He believes strongly that African-Americans should value their art on their terms, looking past aesthetics, and that only thus will the genre grow and be better appreciated.",Normal
"Desanka Maksimović (Serbian Cyrillic: Десанка Максимовић; 16 May 1898 – 11 February 1993) was a Serbian poet, writer and translator. Her first works were published in the literary journal Misao in 1920, while she was studying at the University of Belgrade. Within a few years, her poems appeared in the Serbian Literary Herald, Belgrade's most influential literary publication. In 1925, Maksimović earned a French Government scholarship for a year's study at the University of Paris. Upon her return, she was appointed a professor at Belgrade's elite First High School for Girls, a position she would hold continuously until World War II. In 1933, Maksimović married Sergej Slastikov, a Russian émigré writer. After being dismissed from her post at the high school by the Germans in 1941, she was reduced to a state of poverty and forced to work odd jobs to survive the three-year occupation. She was only permitted to publish children's literature during this period, but secretly compiled a collection of patriotic poems, which were not published until after the war. Among these was Krvava bajka (A Bloody Tale), about the Wehrmacht's killing of schoolchildren in the Kragujevac massacre. It was recited extensively in post-war commemorative ceremonies and became one of the best known Serbian-language poems. To mark her 60th birthday, Maksimović was named the recipient of a string of honours and awards in 1958. In 1964, she published one of her most acclaimed works, a volume of reflective poetry entitled Tražim pomilovanje (I Seek Clemency). The work's veiled critique of the Tito government made it especially popular. The following year, she became a full-fledged member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Following her husband's death in 1970, Maksimović's poetry increasingly began to revolve around the subject of human mortality. Maksimović travelled extensively in the 1970s and 1980s, and some of her visits abroad inspired several of her works. She became involved in efforts to combat government censorship in the early 1980s and was active until her death in 1993. Maksimović was the first female Serbian poet to gain widespread acceptance within Yugoslav literary circles and among the general public. One literary scholar notes that she served as an example for other Serbian women wishing to take up the craft. Maksimović's reputation, which was such that most of her contemporaries referred to her simply by her first name, has led one author to describe her as ""the most beloved Serbian poet of the twentieth century"". Desanka Maksimović was born in the village of Rabrovica, near Valjevo, on 16 May 1898. She was the oldest of her parents' seven children. Her father Mihailo was a schoolteacher and her mother Draginja (née Petrović) was a housewife. Maksimović's ancestors had migrated to Serbia from Herzegovina in the late 18th century. Her maternal grandfather was an Eastern Orthodox priest. Within two months of her birth, her father was reassigned to the nearby village of Brankovina, and the family had to relocate. Maksimović spent much of her early childhood in Brankovina. She took an interest in reading at an early age, spending hours in her father's library. When she was 10, the family moved to Valjevo. Maksimović's family was devastated by World War I. In 1915, she lost her father to typhus while he was serving in the Royal Serbian Army. Her father's death thrust the family into difficult financial straights. In order to be able to take care of her mother and her siblings, Maksimović was forced to drop out of high school. In her free time, she learned French. She re-enrolled after the war and completed her secondary education in 1919. Upon completing high school, Maksimović moved to Belgrade, the capital of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. She enrolled in the University of Belgrade, and took courses in art history and comparative literature. By this time, Maksimović had been writing verse for a number of years. She gave some of her poems to one of her former professors, who in turn gave them to Velimir Masuka, the editor-in-chief of Misao (Thought), one of Serbia's leading artistic and literary publications. Maksimović's poetry first appeared in Misao between 1920 and 1921. She received what was to be the first of many literary awards when one of her poems was voted to be the journal's best by its readers. Within a few years, the Srpski književni glasnik (Serbian Literary Herald), then Belgrade's most influential and respected literary journal, began printing her poems, and several of her works appeared in an anthology of Yugoslav lyric poetry. In 1924, Maksimović published her first poetry collection, simply entitled Pesme (Poems). The collection was met with positive reviews. Maksimović graduated from the University of Belgrade around this time and received a fellowship from the Government of France for a year's study at the University of Paris. She returned to Belgrade in 1925, and upon her return, received a Saint Sava medal from the government for her literary achievements and became a professor at the city's elite First High School for Girls. By the late 1920s, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was mired by ethnic tensions. In 1929, King Alexander decreed that it be renamed Yugoslavia to mitigate growing nationalist resentment. Before long, the country's political disputes spilled over into literary discourse. Yugoslav writers could not agree on the political and artistic direction Yugoslav literature should take. Older writers favoured abiding by existing literary norms while younger ones promoted modernism as a means of explaining the contradictions of modern life and exploring the human subconscious. Maksimović's steadfast refusal to deviate from traditional literary forms and traditions prompted scathing critiques from many of her colleagues in the Yugoslav literary establishment. She would later note: ""I would not have had as many friends as I have now if I had not been able to forget the biting jokes or critical remarks about my poetry or myself."" Yugoslavia had to endure difficult economic conditions during the Great Depression and the country's political landscape deteriorated further. During this time, Maksimović made poetry the main focus of her writing. Many of her poems were first recited before her fellow writers in the home of Smilja Đaković, the publisher of Misao. In 1933, Maksimović married a Russian-born writer named Sergej Slastikov. Following the German-led Axis invasion and subsequent occupation of Yugoslavia, Maksimović was forcibly retired from her teaching position at the First High School for Girls at the behest of the occupational authorities. Impoverished, she resorted to giving private lessons, sewing children's clothes and selling dolls in the marketplace. In order to heat her apartment, Maksimović had to walk from downtown Belgrade to Mount Avala to collect firewood. She wrote patriotic poems in secret during this time but was only allowed to publish children's books. After the war, Yugoslavia became a socialist state under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito. Maksimović was reinstated as a professor at the First High School for Girls. In 1946, she published a collection of war poems titled Pesnik i zavičaj (The Poet and His Native Land). The collection contained one of her best known poems, Krvava bajka (A Bloody Fairy Tale), a requiem for the children killed in the Kragujevac massacre of October 1941. Although she was not a communist, her works received the approval of the Yugoslav government. Maksimović was a fervent Russophile, and at times, her Russophilia was mistaken for covert Cominformism, a serious charge in the years following the Tito–Stalin Split, that if proven, could have landed a person in prison. Maksimović retired from teaching in 1953. In 1958, to mark her 60th birthday, Maksimović received a number of awards from the Yugoslav government and literary establishment. The following year, she received partial membership in the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU). In 1964, Maksimović published a volume of reflective poetry entitled Tražim pomilovanje (I Seek Clemency), which dealt with the 14th-century reign of Dušan the Mighty, the founder of the Serbian Empire. The collection was well received and quickly became a bestseller. Its veiled critique of Tito made it especially popular, especially among those frustrated with the Yugoslav government's increasing arbitrariness and corruption. Maksimović was the recipient of further honours over the next several years. In 1965, her colleagues voted to make her a full member of the SANU. By this time, Maksimović was not only well known and respected within Yugoslavia, but also abroad, with her works having been translated into dozens of languages. Among the translators of her works was the Russian poet Anna Akhmatova. In 1967, Maksimović was awarded a medal by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Maksimović's husband died in 1970. Following his death, her poems increasingly began to deal with the topic of human mortality. In 1975, she received a Vuk Karadžić Award for Lifetime Achievement from the SANU, becoming only the second writer to receive the honour, after Nobel laureate Ivo Andrić. The following year, Maksimović published Letopis Perunovih potomaka (A Chronicle of Perun's Descendants), a poetry collection dealing with medieval Balkan history. She travelled widely in the 1970s and 1980s, visiting many European nations, including the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, but also Australia, Canada, the United States, and China. Her visits to Norway and Switzerland inspired the poetry collection Pesme iz Norveške (Poems from Norway; 1976) and a travel book titled Snimci iz Švajcarske (Snapshots from Switzerland; 1978). In 1982, Maksimović became one of the founding members of the Committee for the Protection of Artistic Freedom, which sought an end to government censorship. In 1988, she published a poetry collection titled Pamtiću sve (I Shall Remember Everything). She died in Belgrade on 11 February 1993, aged 94. ""Maksimović... marked a whole era with her lyrical poetry,"" the literary scholar Aida Vidan writes. She was the first female Serbian poet to gain widespread acceptance from her predominantly male colleagues within the Yugoslav literary milieu, as well as the first Serbian female poet to attract a significant following among the general public. She was Yugoslavia's leading female literary figure for seven decades, first acquiring this distinction during the interwar period and retaining it until her death. The scholar Dubravka Juraga describes her as ""the beloved doyenne of Yugoslav belles lettres"". Maksimović ""offered women writers a model of achievement in the field of lyric poetry,"" the literary scholar Celia Hawkesworth writes. Hawkesworth compares Maksimović's contributions to Serbian literature to that of Elisaveta Bagriana in Bulgaria, Wisława Szymborska in Poland, and Nina Cassian in Romania. The author Christopher Deliso describes Maksimović as ""the most beloved Serbian poet of the twentieth century"". During her lifetime, her reputation was such that many of her contemporaries referred to her simply by her first name. Her poem Krvava bajka is widely considered one of the best known pieces of Serbian-language verse. She is also credited with popularizing love locks in the former Yugoslavia through one of her poems. By the early 2000s, the phenomenon had spread to other parts of the globe. Serbian composer Mirjana Sistek-Djordjevic (born 1935) set poems from Maksimovic’s Trazim Pomilovanje to music in her composition for women’s chorus and orchestra. A statue of Maksimović was unveiled in Valjevo on 27 October 1990, while she was still alive. In the 1990s, as part of the renaming of communist-era street names following the breakup of Yugoslavia, Đuro Salaj Street in Belgrade was renamed Desanka Maksimović Street. In May 1996, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia issued a commemorative postage stamp in her honour. A bronze statue of Maksimović was erected in Belgrade's Tašmajdan Park on 23 August 2007.

"The Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary (Latin: Congregatio Sacrorum Cordium Iesu et Mariæ) abbreviated SS.CC., is a Catholic clerical religious congregation of Pontifical Right for priests and brothers. The congregation is also known as the Picpus because their first house was on the Rue de Picpus in Paris, France. The Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary arose amid the religious upheaval caused by the French Revolution. In March 1792, the Frenchman Pierre Coudrin was secretly ordained to the priesthood. The following May, Father Coudrin went into hiding in an attic of the granary of the Chateau d'Usseau and stayed confined there for six months to escape the government's persecution of the Catholic non-juring priests who refused to accept the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. One evening during his time in hiding, Coudrin had a vision of himself surrounded by a heavenly illuminated group of priests, brothers and sisters dressed in white robes, which he took as his calling to establish a religious institute that would be the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. Coudrin left the granary and began his underground ministry in Poitiers, waiting for the opportunity to start his group. During his underground ministry in 1794, Coudrin met Henriette Aymer de Chevalerie. She had been imprisoned for hiding a priest. Upon her release, she told Coudrin of a vision she had while in prison calling her to the service of God. Coudrin and Henriette Aymer de Chevalerie shared with each other their visions of creating a religious institute in the midst of danger for Roman Catholics in France. On Christmas Eve in 1800, despite knowing they could face the guillotine for their actions, Father Coudrin and Henriette Aymer de Chevalerie officially established the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. In 1817, the Congregation was formally approved by the Pope as a single institute composed of a male and a female branch of religious and a lay branch. The original members of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary founded new schools for poor children, seminaries to help grow the priesthood of their institute and parish missions throughout Europe. In 1825 the evangelization of the Sandwich Islands in the Pacific was entrusted by the Holy See to the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts, and the following year the first band of missionaries of the Sacred Hearts left France. At the time of Father Coudrin's death in 1837, the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary had 276 priests and brothers and 1125 sisters. In 1840 the Brothers founded a house in Louvain, Belgium. The Brothers settled in Spain (1880), the Netherlands (1892), England (1894) and the United States (1905). The sisters, who concentrated their energies on education, went to Chile in 1838 and to Perú in 1848. They also started foundations in Honolulu in 1859 and Ecuador in 1862. Additional houses were founded in Spain (1881), Belgium (1894), England (1895), the Netherlands (1803) and the United States (1908). The Congregation has been present in Ireland since 1948 and in the UK since 1956. The religious institute set off on a new mission that would become their hallmark accomplishment. Teams of missionaries settled in the several Pacific Ocean islands to spread the Gospel, build churches, and evangelize new faithful. The Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary was particularly successful in the Kingdom of Hawaii. They established what is now the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu and built the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace, the oldest Roman Catholic cathedral in continuous use in the United States. Hawaii's first six bishops, from 1833 to 1940, were members of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. Other churches founded by the institute include Saint Joseph Catholic Church in Hilo and Maria Lanakila Catholic Church on Maui. Sacred Hearts Academy (K-12, girls) and St. Patrick's School (elementary, co-ed) in the Honolulu neighborhood of Kaimuki were both founded by the order. In 1833 Reverends Edmundo Demellier, S.S.C.C. and Petithomme, S.S.C.C. began to minister to the Passamaquoddy people in Maine. The Congregation's first province in the United States was established 1846. In 1850 they established the Santa Inés Mission (Chumash), in Solvang, California.",Normal

It was co-founded by Polish businessmen Mariusz Walter, Jan Wejchert and Swiss entrepreneur Bruno Valsangiacomo. It is owned by TVN Group, which as of April 2022, is a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery. Current CEO is Katarzyna Kieli (who is also president and managing director of TVN Warner Bros. Discovery). TVN is available by satellite, cable television and digital terrestrial television. In 2004, with its debut on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, the company became a public limited company. In March 2015, U.S. broadcaster Scripps Networks Interactive bought a 52.7% majority stake in TVN for €584million. In July 2015, SNI bought out TVN's remaining owners, ITI Group and Canal+ Group, for €584million, giving it full ownership. On March 6, 2018, SNI was, in turn, acquired by Discovery, Inc. for US$14.6billion. Liberty Global, which operated pay television provider UPC Polska, is a major shareholder in Discovery. The European Commission thus required TVN to ensure that TVN24 and TVN24 BiS remain available to third-party television providers. In March 1997, Grupa TVN obtained permission from The National Council of Radio Broadcasting and Television to broadcast in central and northern parts of Poland. A few months later Grupa TVN acquired Telewizja Wisła, which had a license to broadcast in southern Poland. The channel was launched nationwide as TVN on 3 October 1997. During the first four years the network was run by its founder Mariusz Walter. In 2001 Piotr Walter became chief executive officer, replacing his father. In 2004 TVN was available in 86% of Polish households. Since 2004 TVN has been listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. On 29 April 2004 TVN launched TVN International, an entertainment and news channel for Polish viewers living abroad. In 2005 TVN acquired rights to organise and broadcast Sopot International Song Festival until 2010, and has acquired said rights again from 2017. In 2006 TVN launched its high definition version, TVN HD, which was the first HD television channel in Poland. TVN is a supporter of the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) initiative that is promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface, and conducted the first tests of HbbTV services in Poland in March 2012. On 16 March 2015, TVN announced a sale of a 52.7% controlling stake to the U.S. broadcaster Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI) for €584million, subject to regulatory approval. In July 2015, SNI bought out the remaining owners for €584million. SNI was, in turn, acquired by Discovery Communications (now Discovery Inc.) for US$14.6billion, in a sale completed 6 March 2018. TVN tends to be strongly critical of the Polish government under the Law and Justice (PiS) party, since it was sworn to power in 2015. Historian and columnist Timothy Garton Ash, writing for The Guardian, praised Fakty TVN's critical coverage of government issues when harshly criticising Telewizja Polska's Wiadomości (News). The Facts is not BBC-style impartial: it clearly favours a more liberal, pro-European Poland and is strongly anti-PiS. But unlike the so-called News, it is still definitely professional, high quality, reality-based journalism. Since 2020 the conflict between TVN and the PiS worsened, to a degree that, by July 2021, a group of PiS lawmakers, submitted to parliament a draft amendment that would prevent companies from outside the European Economic Area taking control of Polish radio and television stations. This would mean that Discovery, the owner of TVN, might be forced to divest its ownership. The Agreement, then PiS' coalition partner, was opposed to this, they instead proposed a change that would allow companies from countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to own more than 49% of shares in Polish media companies, which would mean no change to the American ownership of the channel. However, opposition, as well as representatives from European Union and the United States criticized the law, and international observers expressed fear that the law is threatening press freedom in Poland. The law has been criticized for ""threatening the largest ever US investment in Poland"". This also led to protests within the country, with a number of demonstrations on 10 August. On 11 August 2021, the bill was passed via the Sejm on a vote of 228 to 216, with 10 abstentions, as a result, TVN's licence could expire on September 26. On 30 August 2021, the Chairman of the National Council of Radio Broadcasting and Television sent to the TV operators a decision to move the licence of sister channel TVN24 into the Discovery Communications Benelux B.V. license, based in the Netherlands. The decision ensures the continuity of broadcasting the TVN24 program after 26 September 2021, regardless of the results of the ongoing conflict with Law and Justice government. On 24 September 2021 - two days before the expiration of the previous licence - TVN24 was granted a new Polish licence. On 18 December 2021, the bill was passed via the Sejm. The Sejm voted in favor 229-212 with 11 abstentions to override the Senate's veto. Law and Justice (PiS) party and allied opposition group Kukiz'15 voted for the bill, against was the remaining opposition with the exception of far-right Confederation, which abstained. The bill was vetoed by Polish President Andrzej Duda on 27 December 2021. Uwaga! and Doracda smaku",Normal

"Bibile (also spelled:Bibila) is a town located in Monaragala District, Uva Province of Sri Lanka. Bibile's land is important to Sri Lankan agriculture. It was well known for oranges, though still oranges grown there the original variety 'Bibile Sweet is no longer in existence. Bibile was known as 'Sinhale' in Martin Wickremesinghe's novel ""Gamperaliya"". The population is completely (100%) rural. There are 35208 people living in Bibile and the population density is about 74.4%. As per the official records majority of the population are Sinhalese. The population growth (1981–2001) has reached to 2.5%. The literacy rate is about 84.5% (as of 1999). However, there are about 65.4% does not attend school. Employment rate is about 90.9% (Over age 10). The name of Bibile town is known to the world for many reasons. Name of Professor Senaka Bibile is one of them. His father was a native of Bibile.Dr. Wijya Jayathilake, currently the Executive Director of Transparency International Sri Lanka is also a native of Bibile area. Bibile Madya Maha Vidayalaya (known as Wellassa National College) is one of the main schools in bibile. The first and only (as of 2011) Fulbright Scholar from Bibile; Mr. Nishantha Mallawaarachchi is an old boy of Wellassa National College. A pest identified as Tristrasa is destroying orange cultivations in Bibile much to the anxiety of the residents of the area who depend on this main traditional crop that had been their main source of income for centuries. They said several other pests caused by viruses and fungus affected the orange cultivation after the heavy rains recently experienced in the area. Statistically more than 3000 acres of orange cultivation in the Moneragala district had been affected by pests. The farmers are alarmed that the orange cultivation in the district would be wiped out if the pest was not brought under control immediately. The cultivators who reap a bumper harvest in April and May every year are perturbed that the poor yield this year would result in heavy losses. Orange cultivation in Bibile and several other areas in the Moneragala district were affected by fungus and pests after the monsoonal rains. Bibile Sweet, is the most popular variety unique to the area. However, it is a matter of concern that black spots caused by a fungus affected the fruits on the verge of harvest. Thousands of rotten oranges are found under the trees. The trees should be exposed to the sun to prevent the spread of the pest. Trees in shady gardens are more susceptible to the pest. The affected trees should be pruned and the rotten fruits destroyed. Pesticides should be applied when the trees are flowering to minimize the effect of the fungus,” Manager of the District Agrarian Training Centre, noted. 7°10′N 81°13′E﻿ ﻿7.16°N 81.22°E﻿ 7.16; 81.22",Normal

"Andrew Joseph McDonald (born 8 March 1958) is a British politician and solicitor serving as Member of Parliament (MP) for Middlesbrough since 2012. A member of the Labour Party, he has sat as an independent MP since 2023 after being suspended from the party whip. McDonald served as Shadow Employment Secretary in Keir Starmer's Shadow Cabinet from 2020 until his resignation 2021. Previously, he served as Shadow Secretary of State for Transport in Jeremy Corbyn's Shadow Cabinet from 2016 to 2020. Andy McDonald was born on 8 March 1958, in the Acklam area of Middlesbrough, in the North Riding of Yorkshire. He was educated at a number of local schools, including St. Francis Primary School, St. Edward's Primary School and St. George's Secondary School (which later became Trinity Catholic College, Middlesbrough). He attended St. Mary's Sixth Form College before studying a degree in law at Leeds Polytechnic. Following completion of his law degree, McDonald worked as a solicitor for over 25 years. He was a senior solicitor at the Middlesbrough office of Thompsons Solicitors and led the firm's Serious Injury Unit for the Cumbria, Humberside, North East and Yorkshire areas. He was also the firm's Head of Military Claims for members of the British Armed Forces. Whilst working for the firm, McDonald acted as an adviser to the House of Commons Defence Select Committee for its 2003 report on Armed Forces Pensions and Compensation. He has also served as both Chair and as Secretary of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers' Military Special Interest Group, and was a founder member of The Royal British Legion's Solicitors Group. McDonald was active in local politics in Middlesbrough for many years. He served as a Labour councillor for Westbourne ward from 1995 to 1999. At the time of his selection as a parliamentary candidate, he was chairman of Middlesbrough Labour Party Local Government Committee. Labour shortlisted McDonald as a potential candidate for the Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland constituency in the 2010 United Kingdom general election. However, Tom Blenkinsop was the eventual choice. McDonald became a parliamentarian when he won the Middlesbrough by-election held on 29 November 2012, retaining the seat for Labour following the death of Sir Stuart Bell. McDonald increased the party's share of the vote to 60.5%, though his majority was reduced by 500 to 8,211. Since his election to Parliament, he has campaigned against the ""Bedroom Tax"" (part of the Welfare Reform Act 2012) and in favour of nationalisation of the East Coast Main Line franchise, arguing that the Scotland-London railway had been the only one in the country ""which comes close to paying for itself"" and that journey numbers, revenue and customer satisfaction had grown since nationalisation in 2009. In February 2013, he was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Emily Thornberry, the Shadow Attorney General. Following the Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet reshuffle in October 2013, he became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Chuka Umunna, in Umunna's role as Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills. In January 2016, McDonald was appointed to Jeremy Corbyn's Shadow Cabinet to replace Jonathan Reynolds, who resigned as Shadow Minister for Rail in protest after Corbyn sacked Pat McFadden. In June 2016, he was promoted to Shadow Transport Secretary during Corbyn's post-Brexit Shadow Cabinet reshuffle. In his time as Shadow Transport Secretary, McDonald oversaw the development of Labour's policy to nationalise the railways. On the 25th anniversary of the privatisation of the railways, McDonald said privatisation had failed since the taxpayer was ""putting in even more money to the privatised system than when it was nationalised"", and that nationalisation would allow a Labour government to cap fares and run the railways in the interest of passengers. In March 2018, McDonald was accused of comparing the situation in Gaza to the Holocaust by Karen Pollock, the chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust In April 2020, incoming leader Keir Starmer moved McDonald to the role of Shadow Secretary of State for Employment Rights and Protections. McDonald was the chair of Labour's ""Power in the Workplace Taskforce"" which provided input into Labour's Employment Rights' Green Paper published in September 2021. The paper stated that ""Labour is demanding that the minimum wage is immediately raised to at least £10 per hour for all workers"". In September 2021, McDonald resigned as Shadow Secretary, citing lack of support from Starmer for an increase in the minimum wage to £15 per hour. He said he had been instructed by Starmer's office to argue at the Labour Party Conference ""against a national minimum wage of £15 an hour and against statutory sick pay at the living wage"". In April 2023, using parliamentary privilege when speaking in the House of Commons, McDonald alleged ""shocking, industrial-scale corruption"" surrounding the ongoing Teesworks free port development near Redcar. Prior to this, the alleged corruption had been reported in Private Eye. McDonald's comments led to a high-profile row with the Conservative Party Tees Valley metro mayor, Ben Houchen, who had significant involvement with the project. Following McDonald's comments, Lisa Nandy, the Shadow Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, called for a independent inquiry by the National Audit Office (NAO) into the Teesworks development. The government refused the request for an independent inquiry by the NAO, instead deciding to appoint a government-chosen panel to investigate the allegations. In June 2023, McDonald condemned the government's proposal to house 1,500 asylum seekers on a barge, possibly in Middlesbrough. In October 2023, McDonald lost the Labour whip for giving a speech at a pro-Palestine rally in October 2023. Consequently, he currently sits as an independent MP. He stated ""We won't rest until we have justice, until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea can live in peaceful liberty"". The party described McDonald's comment as ""deeply offensive"". He sued Conservative MP Chris Clarkson over his response to his comments. McDonald was a governor of Abingdon Primary School for fifteen years until 2010, and became a governor of Middlesbrough College in 2012. He has also been chair of two charities in his constituency, the Davison Trust, which works with children with special needs, and the Teesside branch of Headway, which works with people with brain injuries.",Normal

"Of the nine species in the New Zealand parrot superfamily Strigopoidea, the Norfolk kākā and Chatham kākā became extinct in recent history. The last known individual of the Norfolk Kākā died in its cage in London sometime after 1851, and only between seven and 20 skins survive. The Chatham Kākā became extinct in pre-European times, after Polynesians settled the island, between 1550 and 1700, and is only known from subfossil bones. Of the surviving species, the kākāpō is critically endangered, with living individuals numbering only 247 as of 2023. The mainland kākā is listed as endangered, and the kea is listed as vulnerable. The Nestoridae genus Nelepsittacus consists of four extinct species. There are two surviving species and at least one well documented extinct species of the family Nestoridae.

"Fathia Bettahar (27 August 1936 – 4 August 2021) was an Algerian teacher, policy advisor, and women's rights activist. After completing her schooling at the normal school in Oran in 1955, she taught from 1956 to 1964 before moving into school administration until 1974. During this time, she became involved in women's rights issues and joined the Union nationale des femmes algériennes (National Union of Algerian Women). She was particularly interested in initiatives to help women and girls gain an education. In 1974, she was elected as secretary general of the National Union of Algerian Women, and simultaneously served as the secretary general of the Pan-African Women's Organization (PAWO). She attended numerous women's conferences including the 1975 World Conference on Women hosted in Mexico City, the 1975 Women's International Democratic Federation Congress of Berlin, East Germany, and the 1985 World Conference on Women held in Nairobi, Kenya. She was a vice president of the WIDF from 1975 to 1981, while continuing as the PAWO leader until 1986. Between 2001 and 2021, Bettahar served on the on the Commission nationale consultative de protection et de promotion des droits de l'homme (National Advisory Commission for Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Man, CNCPPDH). This independent Algerian body monitored human rights legislation and conditions in the country. Throughout her life, she received numerous honors, including Cuba's Order of Ana Betancourt, the Guinean National Order of Merit, and the National Order of Mali. Along with the founding mothers of PAWO, her portrait is displayed at the headquarters of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Fathia Saïdi was born on 27 August 1936 in the French Mandate of Syria. Her mother was Syrian and her father was Algerian. She attended the École Normale d'Instituteurs d'Oran (Normal School for Teachers of Oran) in the northwestern part of French Algeria, where she studied Arabic, French, and English. Earning her Baccalauréat with honors in 1955, Saïdi continued her studies and completed a specialization in applied teaching the following year. Having completed her studies, in 1956, Saïdi began teaching in Oran. At the end of the year, she married El Habib Bettahar, with whom she would have five children: Rachid, Amira, Amir, Redouane and Ramzi. She was involved in the Oran teacher's union and served on its peace committee. During the Algerian War of Independence, women's organizations were banned, but in 1963, the Union nationale des femmes algériennes (National Union of Algerian Women) reorganized. Bettahar joined the organization and quickly became involved in initiatives to help women gain training and schooling. At the time, few Algerian women were educated and the organization recognized the importance of giving women the knowledge to improve their socio-economic situations. She worked on programs that taught women sewing and tapestry skills which they could do from home. In 1964, Bettahar moved from teaching into administration and became a school director for the next decade. When the National Union of Algerian Women launched a women's health initiative in 1967, she worked to help establish family planning and birthing centers in Algiers, Constantine, and Oran. She was a member of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organisation and attended the women's symposium held in 1967 in Moscow and in 1968 in Albania. She studied law at the University of Oran in 1970 and 1971, but did not complete her studies because she wanted to focus on helping other women. After leaving education in 1974, Bettahar became more involved in women's rights organizations. She published articles in feminist publications, such as Tricontinental, discussing both needs and progress women were making in their strides for political and educational rights in their fights for national independence across the Global South. She attended the 3rd Congress of the National Union of Algerian Women, held the first week of April 1974, in Algiers. At the Congress, the organization stressed the need to continue educational and health initiatives to improve women's opportunities. Bettahar was elected as the secretary general, leading the executive board made up of Lauiza Ben Amor, Saliha Boumerteg, Doria Cherifati, Ain Tair Gundez, Fouzia Hadj-Aissa, Louisa Handan, Sassia Mohammedi, and Leila Saoudi. In July, Bettahar attended the Pan-African Women's Organization Congress in Dakar, and was elected to succeed Jeanne Martin Cissé as PAWO's secretary general. As the Pan-African Women's Organization held observer status since the creation of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the precursor organization to the African Union, in 1963, Bettahar was able to attend all of the meetings of the OAU and influence the policies about women which the organization considered. The goals of PAWO announced in the conference by Bettahar were to not just improve the condition of women in their countries, but to integrate them equally into all sectors of society. In November, along with numerous other prominent women such as Angela Davis, and Valentina Tereshkova, Bettahar was an invited guest at the II Congreso de la Federación de Mujeres Cubanas (2nd Congress of the Federation of Cuban Women), and was awarded by Fidel Castro the Orden Ana Betancourt (Order of Ana Betancourt), inaugurated that year by the Federation of Cuban Women as Cuba's highest distinction for women. Bettahar gave the opening address at the conference ""African Women's Equality: Roles in National Liberation, Development, and Peace"" held in Mogadishu, Somalia, in March 1975, as part of the celebrations of the United Nations' declaration of the year as International Women's Year. Her speech highlighted the importance of women working together to fight imperialism and promote peace to create an environment that would allow development for improving the socio-economic status of women in the region. Three months later, Bettahar, Boumerteg, and Mohammedi were the representatives of the National Union of Algerian Women who attended the World Conference on Women held from 19 June to 2 July, in Mexico City, as part of the Algerian delegation. This conference was pivotal in changing the global perspective of governments towards women's rights. Prior to that time, governments had viewed women's roles within the confines of traditional and religious norms and public policies had not typically addressed disparities in rights and equal opportunities. Bettahar was one of the speakers at the a followup to the conference held on the 3 and 4th of July to discuss how the conference had been portrayed by the media. Other speakers at the event were American Jane Fonda, Jamaican Beverley Manley, and Panamanian Berta Quesada de Moscote. Leaving Mexico, Bettahar attended the 7th Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation held in Berlin, East Germany in October and was one of the dignitaries seated on the dais. She was elected as one of the vice presidents of WIDF at the congress. Bettahar was succeeded by Fatima-Zohra Djeghrour at the 4th Congress of the National Union of Algerian Women held in 1978. At this conference, the women resolved to continue their initiatives to improve women's education and health, but added the need to push for agrarian reforms and rural outreach. She was elected to a second term as the secretary general of the Pan-African Women's Organization in 1980. Over the next several years, she traveled to numerous African countries to observe and assist in organizing women's events in Algeria, Burundi, Cameroon, the Congo, Gambia, Libya, Madagascar, Mali, Senegal, and Tanzania. Bettahar attended the 8th WIDF Congress held in Prague and made a report for the commission on creating support between NGOs and the United Nations. She urged continued cooperation with women's organizations and various UN bodies to address women's and children's issues, promote peace, and advance human rights. In 1983, she was invited to Zimbabwe by the Ministry of Community Development and Women's Affairs and gave a radio address during her four-day trip encouraging African nations to continue to press for gaining their independence and to fight against racism and Apartheid. She was honored as a commander of the Guinean National Order of Merit at the end of 1983. She attended the first congress of National Union of Sahrawi Women held in the Liberated Territories of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in March 1985. Four months later, Bettahar attended the 1985 World Conference on Women in Nairobi, Kenya which ended the United Nations Decade for Women. She served a PAWO president until 1986, when she was succeeded by Ruth Neto of Angola. Bettahar began serving as a school inspector in 1988. At the 8th Congress of the Pan-African Women's Organization held in Harare, Zimbabwe, in 1999, Bettahar was named as honorary life-time president of the organization. That year she was also honored as a knight in the National Order of Mali. Between 2001 and 2016, she served on the Commission nationale consultative de protection et de promotion des droits de l'homme (National Advisory Commission for Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Man, CNCPPDH). She chaired the mediation committee of the CNCPPDH. Created in 2001, this independent body monitored and oversaw the compliance of Algeria with international and regional treaty obligations for the protection of human rights. During Bettahar's tenure, the CNCPPDH recommendations led to changes in the laws concerning women's ability to participate in political processes and hold office, to election reform, to protections for religious freedom, to revision of the judicial and penal codes, to protections for expansion of the free expression of the media, to reforms in equal access to education, and to revision of the family and nationality codes, which included measures to protect the rights of women, children, the elderly, and disabled. For the 50th anniversary of the creation of PAWO in 2012, UNESCO sponsored an event to recognize its founding members. The following year, the African Union decided at its 50th anniversary meeting to hang the portraits of the founding mothers of PAWO alongside the heads of state portraits at their headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The group portrait composition was unveiled in 2017, featuring the likenesses of past presidents Cissé, Bettahar, and Neto, alongside the current president Assetou Koité across the top. Other founding members were also pictured, along with a plaque naming them as a visible reminder of women's contributions to the development of Africa. Bettahar died on 4 August 2021 and was buried at the Cimetière Djenane Sfari (Djenane Sfari Cemetery) in Algiers. Alberto García Molinero and Teresa María Ortega López called Bettahar one of the ""most notably prestigious intellectual authors who published in Tricontinental"" feminist magazine.",Normal

"Jan van der Hoeven (9 February 1801 – 10 March 1868) was a Dutch zoologist. His most famous book is Handboek der Dierkunde (1827–1833), translated into German and English (by prof. Clark). He wrote as readily about crocodiles as about butterflies, lancelets and lemurs. His research on the nautilus resulted in the discovery of a secondary sexual organ of unknown function which was then named after him as Hoeven's organ or Van der Hoeven's organ. Jan van der Hoeven came from a wealthy family of merchants in Rotterdam. In 1819 he moved to Leiden. In 1822 he got a degree in physics and in 1824 in medicine. After a visit to Paris he started working as a family doctor in Rotterdam, but in 1826 he was appointed Professor of Zoology and Mineralogy at the University of Leiden. He married in that year to Anna van Stolk. In his youth Van der Hoeven was influenced by and paid tribute to the German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder and he was friendly with Willem Bilderdijk, a prominent Dutch lawyer, author and historian, known for his Revivalism. Two of his brothers were also professor: Abraham was a Remonstrant theologian, Cornelis a physician. By the 19th century it had become impossible to understand and comprehend all knowledge, but Van der Hoeven was a rather old fashioned scientist, (representing the Biedermeier era) and a generalist: neither specializing, nor becoming a theoreticist. In 1834 he started a magazine in natural history and physiology (Tijdschrift voor natuurlijke geschiedenis en physiologie). Van der Hoeven was also involved in education, writing a biology book for pupils in secondary school, although, paradoxically, he was one of the last professors in Leiden to teach in Latin. In 1860 he asked permission to leave the university. He died in Leiden eight years later. In 1858, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1864 he published the Latin biology textbook Philosophia Zoologica. In 1832 he became correspondent of the Royal Institute and in 1845 member. In 1851 the Royal Institute became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Leptobarbus hoevenii (Bleeker 1851) is named in honor of Bleeker’s fellow Dutchman, “le célèbre professeur de zoologie”. Hemigobius hoevenii (Bleeker, 1851) was also named for him.",Normal
"George Hand Wright (1872–1951) was an American painter, illustrator and printmaker. Born in the Fox Chase section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of a blacksmith, he attended the Spring Garden Institute, a local technical school, and was apprenticed to a lithographer. He studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts under Robert Vonnoh, where his classmates included Robert Henri, John Sloan and William Glackens. He moved to New York City, and his first illustration appeared in Scribner's Magazine in 1893. He illustrated a number of books, and his work soon appeared regularly in magazines such as Scribner's, Harper's, Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post, and others. He married Anne Boylan, and in 1907 they settled in Westport, Connecticut. He became one of the founders of its artistic community. In mid-career, he turned from commercial illustration to watercolors, pastels and etchings. He exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Brooklyn Society of Etchers, the Society of American Etchers, and a number of New York galleries. He was a member of the Society of American Etchers, the Society of Illustrators, the Salmagundi Club and the Westport Artists. In 1939, he was elected to the National Academy of Design. Wright died in Westport in 1951. The Library of Congress has a collection of more than one hundred of his illustrations. A biography, George Hand Wright: An Artist's Life Examined by Kirsten M. Jensen, was published in 2008. Works by similarly-named artists are often misattributed to George Hand Wright:",Normal
"The 1992 Summer Olympics (Spanish: Juegos Olímpicos de Verano de 1992, Catalan: Jocs Olímpics d'estiu de 1992), officially known as the Games of the XXV Olympiad (Spanish: Juegos de la XXV Olimpiada, Catalan: Jocs de la XXV Olimpíada) and commonly known as Barcelona '92, was an international multi-sport event held from 25 July to 9 August 1992 in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Beginning in 1994, the International Olympic Committee decided to hold the Summer and Winter Olympics in alternating even-numbered years. The 1992 Summer and Winter Olympics were the last games to be staged in the same year. These games were the second and last two consecutive Olympic games to be held in Western Europe after the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France held five months earlier. The 1992 Summer Games were the first since the end of the Cold War, and the first unaffected by boycotts since the 1972 Summer Games. 1992 was also the first year South Africa was re-invited to the Olympic Games by the International Olympic Committee, after a 32-year ban from participating in international sport due to Apartheid. The Unified Team (made up by the former Soviet republics without the Baltic states) topped the medal table, winning 45 gold and 112 overall medals. Barcelona is the second-largest city in Spain and the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, and the hometown of then-IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and the famous European club, FC Barcelona. The city was also a host for the 1982 FIFA World Cup. On 17 October 1986, Barcelona was selected to host the 1992 Summer Olympics over Amsterdam, Netherlands; Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Birmingham, United Kingdom; Brisbane, Australia; and Paris, France, during the 91st IOC Session in Lausanne, Switzerland. New Delhi, India, had announced a bid for the games, but withdrew in March 1986. With 85 out of 89 members of the IOC voting by secret ballot, Barcelona won a majority of 47 votes. Samaranch abstained from voting. In the same IOC meeting, Albertville, France, won the right to host the 1992 Winter Games. Paris and Brisbane would eventually be selected to host the 2024 and 2032 Summer Olympics respectively. Barcelona had previously bid for the 1936 Summer Olympics that were ultimately held in Berlin. The 1992 Summer Olympic programme featured 257 events in the following 25 sports: A total of 169 nations sent athletes to compete in the 1992 Summer Games. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, twelve of the fifteen new states chose to form a Unified Team, while the Baltic States of Estonia and Latvia sent their own teams for the first time since 1936, and Lithuania sent its own team for the first time since 1928. For the first time, Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina competed as independent nations after their separation from Socialist Yugoslavia, and Namibia and the unified team of Yemen (previously North and South Yemen) also made their Olympic debuts. The 1992 Summer Olympics notably marked Germany competing as a unified team for the first time since 1964. South Africa returned to the Games for the first time in 32 years. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was banned due to UN sanctions, but individual Yugoslav athletes were allowed to take part as Independent Olympic Participants. Four then-existing National Olympic Committees did not send any athletes to compete: Afghanistan, Brunei, Liberia and Somalia. 9,356 athletes from 169 NOCs The following table reflects the top ten nations in terms of total medals won at the 1992 Games (the host nation is highlighted). In order to guarantee that the international signal was produced objectively and impartially, for the first time in Olympic history, a host broadcaster was expressly created for each of the 1992 Olympic Games instead of delegating responsibility to a national host broadcaster. The Albertville Organizing Committee created the Organisme de radio télévision olympique '92 (ORTO'92) for the Winter Olympics and the Barcelona Organizing Committee created the Radio Televisión Olímpica '92 (RTO'92) for the Summer Olympics. RTO'92 managed the staff and the production and technical resources hired to Radiotelevisión Española (RTVE), the Corporació Catalana de Ràdio i Televisió (CCRTV) and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). With a workforce of 3,083 people, a permanent radio and television installation at the Olympic Stadium and Palau Sant Jordi, and over 50 mobile units for other venues, RTO'92 provided live coverage of all Summer Olympic sports for the first time ever –except for a few preliminary events–, some 2,800 hours of live television footage, to its international rights-holders. The International Broadcast Centre (IBC) was located at the exhibition halls of Fira de Barcelona in Montjuïc. NHK and Panasonic developed the 12"" DX digital system used to record the Games digitally for the first time. Also new were the underwater camera dolly on a track at the bottom of the swimming pool, the underwater microcameras at the bottom of the water polo pool, the periscope camera capable of transmit shots from below and above the water, the overhead camera dolly on a track along the canopy of the Olympic Stadium for the 35 metres (115ft) high zenithal shot of the athletics track, the stabilized optic gyro-zoom cameras, the super slow motion PAL camera and the microcamera on the high jump bar. To cover the Games, major international broadcasting unions such as the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU), the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT), the Organización de Televisión Iberoamericana (OTI), the Arab States Broadcasting Union (ASBU), the Caribbean Broadcasting Union (CBU) and the Union of African National Television and Radio Organizations (URTNA), secured the rights for their member broadcasters in their countries. In other countries, broadcast networks secured the rights directly or pooled to secure the rights. The Games were covered by the following television and radio broadcasters: The 1992 Winter and Summer Olympics were the first in which a comprehensive coverage in high-definition television (HDTV) was attempted. The European HDTV broadcast of the Summer Olympics was managed by the joint venture ""Barcelona 1250"" created by RTO'92, RTVE, Retevisión and PESA, with the financial support of the European Economic Community and a workforce of over 300 production and technical staff. A total of 225 hours and 45 minutes was broadcast in analog HD-MAC standard in 1,250 lines and 16:9 aspect ratio, with commentary in five languages –Spanish, English, French, German and Italian– in addition to the non-commentary sound track, of eighteen different sports at seventeen venues, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Events from five venues were covered live –80% of the total broadcast time– and other events were recorded for a delayed broadcast. On-screen text and graphics were shown in HDTV for the first time ever. Nearly 700 viewing sites installed throughout Europe, including the fifty HDTV receivers installed in various pavilions at the Seville Universal Exposition, were able to receive the broadcast. For Japan, NHK also covered the 1992 Summer Olympics in HDTV in their own analog Hi-Vision system. The Basque nationalist group ETA attempted to disrupt the Barcelona Games with terrorist attacks. It was already feared beforehand that ETA would use the Olympics to gain publicity for their cause in front of a worldwide audience. As the time of the Games approached, ETA committed attacks in Barcelona and the Catalonia region as a whole, including the deadly 1991 Vic bombing. On 10 July 1992, the group offered a two-month truce covering the Olympics in exchange for negotiations, which the Spanish government rejected. However, the Games went ahead successfully without an attack. The celebration of the 1992 Olympic Games had an enormous impact on the urban culture and outward projection of Barcelona. The Games provided billions of dollars for infrastructure investments, which are considered to have improved the quality of life in the city, and its attraction for investment and tourism. Barcelona became one of the most visited cities in Europe after Paris, London, and Rome. Barcelona's nomination for the 1992 Summer Olympics sparked the implementation of an ambitious plan for urban transformation that had already been developed previously. Barcelona was opened to the sea with the construction of the Olympic Village and Olympic Port in Poblenou. New centers were created, and modern sports facilities were built in the Olympic zones of Montjuïc, Diagonal, and Vall d'Hebron; hotels were also refurbished and new ones built. The construction of ring roads around the city helped to reduce traffic density, and El Prat airport was modernized and expanded with the opening of two new terminals. The Oxford Olympics Study estimates the direct costs of the Barcelona 1992 Summer Olympics to be US$9.7 billion (expressed in 2015 U.S. dollars) with a cost overrun of 266%. This includes only sports-related costs, that is: (i) operational costs incurred by the organizing committee for the purpose of staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, direct transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services; and (ii) direct capital costs incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, media and press center, and similar structures required to host the Games. Costs excluded from the study are indirect capital and infrastructure costs, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games. The costs for Barcelona 1992 may be compared with those of London 2012, which cost US$15 billion with a cost overrun of 76%, and those of Rio 2016 which cost US$4.6 billion with a cost overrun of 51%. The average cost for the Summer Olympics since 1960 is US$5.2 billion, with an average cost overrun of 176%. There were two main musical themes for the 1992 Games. The first one was ""Barcelona"", a classical crossover song composed five years earlier by Freddie Mercury and Mike Moran; Mercury was an admirer of lyric soprano Montserrat Caballé, both recorded the official theme as a duet. Due to Mercury's death eight months earlier, the duo was unable to perform the song together during the opening ceremony. A recording of the song instead played over a travelogue of the city at the start of the opening ceremony, seconds before the official countdown. ""Amigos Para Siempre"" (Friends for Life) was the other musical theme and it was official theme song of the 1992 Summer Olympics. It was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Don Black, and sung by Sarah Brightman and José Carreras during the closing ceremonies. Ryuichi Sakamoto composed and conducted some musical pieces at the opening ceremony musical score. The Opening Olympic fanfare was composed by Angelo Badalamenti and with orchestrations by Joseph Turrin. The official mascot was Cobi, a Catalan sheepdog in cubist style designed by Javier Mariscal. He was widely featured in merchandising products and starred his own animated television series, The Cobi Troupe. A renewal in Barcelona's image and corporate identity could be seen in the publication of posters, commemorative coins, stamps minted by the FNMT in Madrid, and the Barcelona 1992 Olympic Official Commemorative Medals, designed and struck in Barcelona. 41°21′51″N 2°09′08″E﻿ ﻿41.36417°N 2.15222°E﻿ 41.36417; 2.15222",Normal
"The Accredited Economic Development Organization (AEDO) program was created by the International Economic Development Council (IEDC), based in Washington, D.C. as means of recognizing the professional excellence of economic development entities. IEDC is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping economic developers do their job more effectively and raising the profile of the profession. IEDC membership represents the entire range of the profession ranging from regional, state, local, rural, urban, and international economic development organizations, as well as chambers of commerce, technology development agencies, utility companies, educational institutions, consultants and redevelopment authorities. Economic development has evolved into a professional industry of highly specialized practitioners. These practitioners have two key roles: one is to provide leadership in policy-making, and the other is to administer policy, programs, and projects. Economic development practitioners generally work in public offices on the state, regional, or municipal level, or in public-private partnerships organizations that are may be partially funded by local, regional, state or federal tax money. These economic development organizations (EDOs) function as individual entities and in some cases as departments of local governments. Their role is to seek out new economic opportunities and retain their existing business wealth. The goals of the AEDO Program are: Organizations receive critical evaluation and peer mentoring by certified professionals concerning internal and external operations. The accreditation process consists of two phases, designed to elicit specific information about the structure, organization, funding, programs, and staff of the candidate economic development organization. The first phase of accreditation involves the submission of documents demonstrating the organization's development, structure, and activity to IEDC. The document review process helps to determine if the organization is eligible for accreditation and deserving of a site team visit. The second phase involves a visit by experienced economic developers and is designed to assess the organization in action. Members of the AEDO Advisory Committee andor Certified Economic Developers (CEcDs) conduct the visit. It is important to note that IEDC's Certified Economic Developers are recognized around the world as having achieved a level of excellence in their understanding of the tools and programs of economic development. AEDO status signifies a distinguished achievement for an economic development organization. This article about an organization in the United States is a stub.

"Mari-Jo P. Ruiz (1943–2022) was a Filipina mathematician and professor of mathematics at Ateneo de Manila University. Ruiz specialized in graph theory and operations research. Ruiz grew up in Manila, and was educated at College of the Holy Spirit Manila. She graduated from Marymount Manhattan College in New York City in 1963, and soon afterward completed a master's degree at New York University. She joined the Ateneo de Manila faculty in 1965, eight years before the school began accepting women as students. She chose academia over a competing job offer from industry because at the time it paid slightly better. She acquired the nickname ""Mustang Mary"" at this time, because of the Ford Mustang that she drove. Ruiz completed her PhD at Ateneo in 1981. At Ateneo, she served as chair of mathematics, chair of management engineering, dean of arts and sciences, and trustee. She retired to become a professor emeritus in 2009. She died on 29 December 2022 at the age of 79. With Jin Akiyama, she was the author of the book A Day’s Adventure in Math Wonderland (World Scientific, 2008; translated into 7 other languages).

"Linda Morris Mti (born 1954) is a retired South African politician and civil servant who is best known for his tenure as National Commissioner of Correctional Services from 2001 to 2006. He currently faces charges of corruption, fraud, and money laundering in connection with contracts illegally awarded to Bosasa during his tenure as commissioner. Mti was a senior member of Umkhonto we Sizwe during apartheid and he represented the African National Congress (ANC) in the National Assembly from 1994 until 1996, when he was appointed as chief of the National Intelligence Coordinating Committee. He also served on the ANC's National Executive Committee from 1994 to 1997 and is a former Provincial Chairperson of the ANC in the Eastern Cape. After leaving the Department of Correctional Services in late 2006, he served as local head of security for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Mti was born in 1954 in Port Elizabeth in the former Cape Province. He attended the University of Fort Hare and in 1976 began his working life as a laboratory technician in the Cape. He was also active in anti-apartheid politics through the Black Consciousness movement. In 1977, in the aftermath of the Soweto uprising, he was one of many Black Consciousness activists detained by the Security Branch of the police; upon his release, he went into exile in Lesotho, where he joined the African National Congress (ANC). Until 1985, Mti was stationed with the ANC's operation in Lesotho, where he was a senior member of the Umkhonto we Sizwe command and Regional Politico-Military Council under Chris Hani and Lambert Moloi. From 1985 to 1990, he was a member of the Regional Politico-Military Council in Zimbabwe. He is still known in ANC circles by his nom de guerre, ""Richman"". Mti returned to South Africa after the ANC was unbanned by the apartheid government in 1990, and in the early 1990s he served as chairperson of the ANC's branch in the region that became the Eastern Cape. In South Africa's first post-apartheid election in 1994, Mti was elected to represent the ANC in the National Assembly, the lower house of the new South African Parliament. He chaired Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Safety and Security. In addition, in December 1994, the ANC's 49th National Conference elected him to a three-year term on the party's National Executive Committee. In late 1996, Mti was appointed to succeed Moe Shaik as chief of the National Intelligence Coordinating Committee. The committee was responsible for coordinating the activities of all government agencies with intelligence-gathering functions. In August 2001, President Thabo Mbeki appointed Mti as National Commissioner of Correctional Services. In July 2004, the Cabinet approved a three-year extension of his contract. In the same month, the Department of Correctional Services, under Mti's leadership, privatised the provision of nutrition services in its prisons, appointing Gavin Watson's Bosasa Operations as a contractor; over the next two years, a number of other large department contracts, cumulatively worth R1.8 billion, were signed with Bosasa. On 31 March 2006, the Beeld and its sister paper, Die Burger, published front-page stories linking Mti to Bosasa by way of a private company called Lianorah Investment Consultancy (named after Mti's mother), which Mti had registered through Bosasa's company secretary, Tony Perry. Mti denied all allegations of improper conduct or inappropriate ties to Bosasa, but the story led to months of sustained pressure on him, invoking the consternation of Parliament and triggering an investigation by the Public Service Commission. In addition, on 7 November 2006, the South African Police Service reported that Mti had been arrested for drunk driving (see below). On 9 November, the department announced that Mti had resigned at the beginning of the month and would leave public service at the end of the month. In a statement, it commended him ""for the critical role he has played in the transformation of the department from the quagmire of its apartheid legacy to its current status as a leading player in offender corrections and rehabilitation"". Investigations into Mti's role in irregularities in the Bosasa contracts continued for over a decade after his resignation (see below). The Department of Correctional Services had announced that Mti was leaving the commissioner's office in order to accept a position as local head of security for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which South Africa was hosting. The local organising committee initially denied this, saying that he was only under consideration for the role; he was, in any case, ultimately appointed. The Mail & Guardian said that he ""kept a low profile"" while in the position. In April 2016, the council of Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality appointed Mti as head of the city's department of safety and security. The Democratic Alliance (DA) reportedly opposed his appointment, on the grounds that he was still under investigation in connection with alleged fraud at the Department of Correctional Services. In addition, he was appointed on the recommendation of Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Danny Jordaan, but Jordaan was succeeded in August by Athol Trollip, who publicly expressed concern that Mti's appointment had been irregular. In December 2016, the council announced that Mti would take early retirement in May 2017. Mti has been arrested for drunken driving at least three times, twice during his tenure as Correctional Services Commissioner, and was convicted twice. In 1992, while he was ANC chair in the Eastern Cape, he was convicted in Port Elizabeth of drunk driving and reckless or negligent driving; he paid a R400 fine in lieu of serving two months' imprisonment. He was arrested again in February 2005, outside Port Elizabeth's Boardwalk Casino, after a late-night accident with another vehicle, and again in early November 2006 after an accident in rush-hour traffic in Sandringham, Johannesburg. In respect of the November 2006 incident, Mti was acquitted of drunk driving and reckless or negligent driving in the Hillbrow Magistrate's Court in June 2008. The state failed to subpoena its main witness (the driver of the other car) or otherwise to prove its case. Irregularities in the prosecutorial procedure led the magistrate to castigate the prosecutors' ""incompetent and unprofessional conduct"" and led the Mail & Guardian to wonder whether the trial had been ""cooked"" in Mti's favour; the prosecutors involved were ultimately served written warnings by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). Mti's trial on the February 2005 charge was postponed for some time after the charge was initially withdrawn by prosecutors, and it was not concluded until October 2009, when Mti entered into a plea bargain with the NPA. He pled guilty to drunk driving – having been almost three times over the legal blood alcohol limit – and paid a R20,000 fine in lieu of two months' imprisonment. He was also served a mandatory six-month prison sentence, suspended conditionally for five years, and his driving license was confiscated for six months. After Mti resigned from the Department of Correctional Services in November 2006, the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) launched an investigation into the department's contracts with Bosasa. The report of the SIU investigation was finalised in late 2009 and was referred to the NPA for decision on possible prosecutions, but it was not released publicly. In the interim, the Mail & Guardian published a series of further exposés about Mti's relationship with Bosasa, leading Bosasa to complain that it was subjected to ""trial by press"". Among other things, leaked travel records apparently showed that Bosasa had provided Mti with substantial benefits, including luxury hotel stays and family travel, while he was serving as Correctional Services Commissioner. In March 2011, the SIU's report was leaked to City Press, which reported that the investigation had uncovered evidence of an ""improper and corrupt relationship"" between Mti (and other officials) and Bosasa; among the specific allegations was the claim that Bosasa had paid for Mti's house. In February 2019, Mti submitted to arrest and appeared in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria, alongside others, on charges emanating from the Bosasa contracts. He was granted R20,000 bail. Before the case was heard in court, in March 2022, the Zondo Commission on state capture published its report on government contracts with Bosasa. The commission noted that there were already pending charges against Mti, but the report nonetheless formally recommended that law enforcement agencies should investigate and prosecute Mti for his involvement in the Bosasa contracts. According to the commission, there was strong evidence to suggest that the department's former chief financial officer, Patrick Gillingham, had facilitated the unlawful award of contracts to Bosasa, and that Mti himself had been complicit. The report said:  complicity included providing Gillingham with protection from investigation, discipline and prosecution, at the highest level with the department. Mti facilitated the unlawful awarding of tenders in breach of the Constitution and legislation in order to benefit himself, his family, Bosasa, its associates and the Watson family. In the criminal case, pre-trial proceedings resumed in the Gauteng High Court in May 2022, but Mti successfully applied for a postponement. Mti is accused alongside Gillingham, another former department executive, and former Bosasa executive Angelo Agrizzi. In the final docket, Mti is charged with one count of corruption, four counts of fraud, five counts of money laundering, and five contraventions of the Public Finance Management Act. The charges arise from four contracts, worth over R1.8 billion, awarded to Bosasa and its subsidiaries from 2004 to 2007.",Normal

"The Battle of Ist was a naval engagement in Adriatic Sea, between the islands of Škarda and Molat, off the island of Ist, on 29 February 1944. The engagement was fought between two Free French Naval Forces destroyers and a Kriegsmarine force of two corvettes, two torpedo boats and three minesweepers. The German flotilla had been deployed to escort a freighter. In the ensuing engagement the French managed to destroy the German freighter and a corvette in return for no loss before withdrawing. In 1944 for operations in the Adriatic Sea, the Royal Navy formed the 24th Destroyer Flotilla at Bari which consisted of ten ships, including three French destroyers, Le Fantasque, Le Terrible and Le Malin. The French under Captain Pierre Lancelot would operate in the northern part of the Adriatic, while the British would do the same but further south. The speed of the French destroyers, being the fastest in the world at the time, allowed them to react swiftly both on intelligence and to strike at targets. On 29 February the French departed Manfredonia fifty miles North of Bari and headed up the Adriatic. At the same time a German convoy had departed from Pola consisting of a strong escort: the torpedo boats TA36 and TA37 (the former Italian Ariete-class Stella Polare and Gladio); the submarine chasers UJ201 and UJ205, (the former Italian Gabbiano-class corvettes Egeria and Colubrina); and three small minesweepers. They were escorting the 6,311-gross register ton(GRT) freighter Kapitan Diederichsen. The German escorts had only been recently commissioned and were only on their second operation. The two were heading towards each other in the dark of the night with very little moonlight. At 21:35 hours Le Terrible's radar soon picked up targets further north and sailed towards them. When it was known that the targets were confirmed as non-allied, the French opened fire at roughly 9,000 yards just west of Ist Island, surprising the Germans. Le Malin opened fire on the largest of the targets which was the freighter and soon scored a hit. The Germans attempted to lay a smoke screen, but the destroyers with their speed soon closed in using their radar. Le Terrible scored more hits on the freighter while Le Malin targeted the closest of the escorts. At 4,500 yards (4,100m) Le Terrible fired a salvo of torpedoes; the first salvo missed but the first device of the second salvo hit the freighter amidships which then caused her to burn fiercely and she soon drifted helplessly. Meanwhile, UJ201 was soon struck by Le Malin's well-directed 90-pound (41kg) shells; now having found the range, the German corvette was hit six more times and was soon a burning wreck. Le Malin was close enough to launch a salvo of torpedoes; one hit and was enough to detonate the ship's magazine causing a tremendous explosion lighting up the sky. She sank immediately and all hands went with her. Both Le Terrible and Le Malin then took on the rest of the German escorts; TA36 suffered near misses and was soon hit right on the end of the bow suffering light damage. TA37 however was hit in the engine room and burst into flames which caused her speed to drop rapidly. Lancelot was about to finish off the German ship, but on seeing low fast-moving silhouettes of potential E-boats he decided to withdraw. They were in fact the motor minesweepers coming in to help with the crew of the stricken freighter and search for survivors of the destroyed UJ201. Lancelot headed south back to port. The Kapitan Diederichsen remained afloat but only for some time, an attempt to tow failed and the survivors were taken off by the German escorts. The heavily damaged TA37 was towed successfully and made it to Pola. The French forced remained in the Adriatic for half of the year bombarding Zante, and on 19 March sank two Siebel ferries SF273 and SF274 on their way to Pylos and crippling another two. In August they took part in Operation Dragoon, the Southern Invasion of France.",Normal
"""Last Gasp"" is the fourth episode of the first series of British dark comedy anthology television programme Inside No.9. It first aired on 26 February 2014 on BBC Two. The story revolves around the ninth birthday of the severely ill Tamsin (Lucy Hutchinson). Tamsin's parents Jan (Sophie Thompson) and Graham (Steve Pemberton) have arranged with charity WishmakerUK for singer Frankie J Parsons (David Bedella) to visit as a treat for their daughter. Frankie dies after blowing up a balloon, leading to arguments between Graham, WishmakerUK representative Sally (Tamsin Greig) and Frankie's assistant Si (Adam Deacon) over the now-valuable balloon containing Frankie's last breath. The story, written by Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, was inspired by someone Pemberton had seen on television who collected air from different places. The episode is more comedic than others in the series, and critiques celebrity culture and human greed. ""Last Gasp"" received a fairly negative critical response; in retrospect, Pemberton claimed that ""people hated"" the episode. Several critics, including Gerard Gilbert of The Independent, Jack Seale of Radio Times and comedy critic Bruce Dessau—though complimentary of Inside No.9 generally—considered ""Last Gasp"" to be weaker than the previous three episodes, but not unwatchable. Other reviewers gave a more positive response, but a particularly scathing review by columnist Virginia Blackburn was published in the Daily Express. On its first showing, ""Last Gasp"" drew 872,000 viewers, lower than any previous episode. Pemberton subsequently sold a balloon containing his own breath on eBay, with proceeds going to a Sport Relief charity. ""Last Gasp"" was inspired by someone Pemberton had seen on children's programme Multi-Coloured Swap Shop who collected apparently empty jars which actually contained air taken from different places. The idea, which he considered ""bizarre"" but ""very special"", had ""haunted"" him. This gave him the idea of collecting the breath of celebrities. The death of Michael Jackson and the death of Amy Winehouse, along with the associated collecting of memorabilia, also served as inspiration. For Pemberton, the family and house in ""Last Gasp"" were very ""normal"". The episode was filmed on location in what director David Kerr called an ""utterly freezing"" house. The finished episode, for Kerr, had a degree of ""suburban darkness"" in that, though the events unfold in a relatively unremarkable setting, the darker side of human nature is revealed. At the same time, the characters' arguments lead to humour. Shearsmith described ""Last Gasp"" as like a My Family episode ""gone wrong"". As the format of Inside No. 9 requires new characters each week, the writers were able to attract actors who may have been unwilling to commit to an entire series. In addition to Pemberton—who played Graham, the father—""Last Gasp"" starred Sophie Thompson as Jan, the mother; Lucy Hutchinson as 9-year-old Tamsin; David Bedella as popstar Frankie J Parsons; Tamsin Greig as Sally, of WishmakerUK; and Adam Deacon as Si, Parsons's assistant. It was the first episode of the programme not to star Shearsmith. For Kerr, the typical difficulty associated with the use of child actors was not present in ""Last Gasp""; for him, Hutchinson ""was superb. She was brilliant; she had maturity beyond her years."" Pemberton and Shearsmith had been keen to use Inside No.9 as a vehicle to work with new people, and had been keen to collaborate with Greig for some time. Kerr said that ""one of the real joys of Inside No.9"" was the opportunity to see actors in very different roles to those in which they had previously starred. He used Greig as his example, saying the character of Sally was somewhat different from the roles in which Greig had previously performed. On the ninth birthday of the severely ill Tamsin, parents Graham and Jan struggle with a camcorder and blow up balloons. A charity called WishmakerUK has arranged for pop star Frankie J Parsons to visit Tamsin. Frankie arrives, much to the excitement of Jan, accompanied by his personal assistant Si and WishmakerUK representative Sally. Frankie visits Tamsin in her bedroom, and blows up a purple balloon for her. He begins to struggle for breath and then collapses from an intracranial aneurysm. Later, Graham makes tea for Jan and Sally. Jan is upset about Frankie's death. Si says that no one can touch anything or call an ambulance until Frankie's manager arrives. Tamsin, sitting in her wheelchair, holds the balloon; and Graham and Si realise that it may be valuable. Si takes the balloon from Tamsin, and Graham ties it. Sally takes a call from her boss, but does not mention Frankie's death. She makes excuses to have a colleague cover for her on her next assignment so that she can stay at the house. Graham and Si argue over the balloon, and Graham gives it to Sally, as he considers her ""a neutral"". He looks online to work out how much the balloon and accompanying footage may be worth. Later, Jan starts playing one of Frankie's CDs, but Graham turns it off to talk about money with Si and Sally. Jan takes Tamsin outside. Tamsin worries that Frankie's death is her fault because she asked him to blow up the balloon. She asks if Frankie's soul will go to Heaven, and Jan says that it will. Inside, Si, Sally and Graham argue about how to split the money they will make from the balloon. The argument gets heated after Sally argues that the fact Tamsin will soon die should preclude her from getting a share. As Graham threatens to pop the balloon, Jan reappears and chastises him. Tamsin, who is now considered neutral, takes the balloon. Graham says they should all settle down and have lunch. In the kitchen, Sally and Jan talk about Sally's work, and, in Tamsin's bedroom, Graham and Si talk about Parsons, with Si revealing that Parsons was actually unpleasant to work for. There is a loud bang from outside, and everyone goes back into the lounge, erroneously thinking that the balloon has burst. Graham and Si take the balloon to an upstairs bedroom and tuck it into a bed, while Jan turns the music back on. Everyone sits in silence, waiting for Parsons's manager to arrive. Jan suggests that Graham blow up another balloon for Tamsin. Sally, Si and Graham realise that, with the camera footage they have, they can blow up all the purple balloons and sell them to multiple bidders. Jan screams when she sees movement in Tamsin's bedroom, and it is realised that Frankie is still alive. Jan takes Tamsin out of the room and the remaining three agree, after panicked discussion, that they should kill Frankie. Si loses a coin toss and smothers Frankie with a cushion. Later, out on the street, Frankie's body is put into an ambulance. Si says to Sally and Graham that he will be in touch and leaves. Sally and Graham discuss selling the camcorder footage, and Jan runs inside to see that Tamsin is not in her chair or room. Upstairs, Tamsin crawls onto the bed containing the balloon, carrying a heart-shaped helium balloon. On the street, Sally, Graham and Jan see Tamsin opening the upstairs window. She releases the helium balloon with the balloon containing Frankie's breath attached. The two float skyward as Graham films. The world's sick, Jan! Someone paid five and a half grand for Scarlett Johansson's used tissue! It's like Billy said: 'We didn't start the fire'... Graham responds to Jan's claim that his plan is ""sick"". Comedy critic Bruce Dessau described the episode as containing ""a nice if not very subtle critique"" of the value of celebrity, and noted that there was ""a flicker"" of ""The Pardoner's Tale"", a story from writer Geoffrey Chaucer's collection The Canterbury Tales. Rebecca McQuillan, writing in The Herald, felt the episode captures the ""sheer unctuousness"" of fandom. She added that, as the plot advances, the venal and vulgar attitudes which are initially hidden behind the characters' fake grins are revealed. For her, the story takes place around Tamsin, who looks ""worldly and disappointed with the human race"". David Chater, of The Times, identified celebrity worship and greed as the episode's themes. In South African newspaper The Star, the episode was identified as the most cynical of the first series. For the reviewer, it ""parades before us the depravity to which the human animal will stoop, and explores how agendas can be furthered under the noble cover of altruism"". David Upton, writing for PopMatters, called it ""easily the most acerbic and most overtly comic"" episode of the series. He listed three reasons that the episode does not seem like something produced by Pemberton and Shearsmith: its avoidance of the horrific; the fact that it does not star Shearsmith; and its direct focus on celebrity culture, which Upton considers a modern phenomenon. Instead, he suggested that it feels closer to a story from Charlie Brooker's anthology programme Black Mirror. The focus of ""Last Gasp"" on comedy to the exclusion of horror, for Upton, leaves it ""stranded"" when compared to the other episodes. Some critics questioned the plausibility of the premise. Daily Express columnist Virginia Blackburn felt that there was potential for a comedic critique of the celebrity memorabilia market. Such a story, she suggested, would be based around selling the balloon—not the breath—something she felt may have happened. Paddy Shennan, writing for the Liverpool Echo, questioned the extent to which the ending would actually impact the characters, asking whether they could have nonetheless sold the fake balloons. For freelance journalist Dan Owen the premise ""riff on the fact  online auction sites like eBay often sell ludicrous items for huge amounts of money"". Owen argued that the episode's plot offers an amusing way that such a sale could come about. Though not fraudulent, the sale would nonetheless be ""highly disrespectful and money-grabbing"". Gerard Gilbert of The Independent, Jack Seale of Radio Times, Dessau and Owen all stressed that ""Last Gasp"" was weaker than the three previous episodes of Inside No.9. Seale claimed that there were ""several sublime moments – but no knockout blow"", while Dessau wrote that ""it doesn't really go anywhere and it resolves itself a little too simplistically"", and Owen felt that the episode ""didn't manage to go anywhere very unexpected... and just sort of ended"". All three suggested, however, that the episode still had its strengths; for Seale, it was as ""brilliantly acted and constructed as you'd expect"", Dessau considered it watchable, and Owen felt it was enjoyable to watch with a number of funny moments. Shennan, writing for the Liverpool Echo, wrote that ""perhaps there had to be a dud – or, at least, disappointing – episode sooner or later"", noting that you ""can't win 'em all"". The acting in the episode was praised by Michael Hogan and Rachel Ward, who wrote in The Daily Telegraph that ""with their gift for comedy, vulnerability and pathos, Tamsin Grieg  and Sophie Thompson... deliver excellent performances"". Similarly, Owen wrote that ""the performances were good—especially from Thompson as the mousy housewife, and I liked the sour expressions from child star Hutchinson"". Nonetheless, he thought it regrettable than a real-world musician had not been cast, especially as he considered it unlikely that Tamsin would admire Parsons. Awarding the episode three and a half out of five, he thought ""the set-up... sublime, the central dilemma amusing, and the execution typically brilliant"". In the review published in The Star, ""Last Gasp"" was described as ""hilarious"". The title, it was suggested, is appropriate, ""as I caught myself gasping more than once as its foul contents unfolded"". Upton called the episode ""a clever little piece"". On the day it was shown, ""Last Gasp"" was selected as comedy ""pick of the day"" in the Daily Express, but, the following day, an extremely critical review of the episode by Virginia Blackburn was published in the newspaper. She felt that the episode was disappointing and wasted the talent of the actors, and that the concept was ""the sort of idea you can imagine two students coming up with after the sixth pint... and then feeling slightly embarrassed about it when they wake up the next morning"". She summed up the episode by saying that it was neither funny nor clever, and ""is so utterly, irredeemably, naffly silly that it ends up being incredibly irritating and nothing else"". An interview with Shearsmith and Pemberton was published on British comedy website Chortle.co.uk after Inside No.9 won the Chortle Award for best TV show. The pair were asked if they would ever consider writing an episode with a happy ending. Shearsmith responded by saying ""Yes, because that would be the biggest surprise of all... But last year we had the Last Gasp, and that had quite a happy ending - and people hated that one!"" Similarly, Pemberton suggested that ""people are disappointed if we don't deliver something horrible"". Based on overnight viewing figures, ""Last Gasp"" drew a lower viewership than any previous episode of Inside No.9, with 872,000 viewers. In most UK listings, it was preceded by Line of Duty, which drew 2.2 million viewers (9.7% of the audience). However, the following episode of Inside No.9, ""The Understudy"", drew a lower number of viewers still, with 720,000 viewers. The final episode of the first series, ""The Harrowing"", saw an increase in viewing figures, leaving ""Last Gasp"" with the second-lowest viewership of the series, below the series average of 904,000 people, and the slot average of 970,000 people. Pemberton listed a balloon containing his breath which had appeared on ""Last Gasp"" on eBay. Listed with the balloon was a copy of the episode's poster signed by Pemberton and Shearsmith. The auction was held to raise money for Give It Up, a Sport Relief charity founded by comedian Russell Brand to help those recovering from alcoholism and drug addiction. The winning bid on the auction was for £265.00.",Normal
"Jeremiah 11 is the eleventh chapter of the Book of Jeremiah in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. This book contains prophecies attributed to the prophet Jeremiah, and is one of the Books of the Prophets. This chapter includes the first of the passages known as the ""Confessions of Jeremiah"" (Jeremiah 11:18–12:6). The original text was written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 23 verses. Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). Some fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, i.e., 4QJera (4Q70; 225–175 BCE), with extant verses 3‑6, 19‑20. There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint (with a different verse numbering), made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; G {displaystyle {mathfrak {G}}} B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: G {displaystyle {mathfrak {G}}} S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; G {displaystyle {mathfrak {G}}} A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; G {displaystyle {mathfrak {G}}} Q; 6th century). The Septuagint version doesn't contain a part what is generally known to be verses 7–8 in Christian Bibles. The parashah sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex. Jeremiah 11 is a part of the Fifth prophecy (Jeremiah 11-13) in the section of Prophecies of Destruction (Jeremiah 1-25). {P}: open parashah; {S}: closed parashah. This section contains the 'second major prose sermon' in the book of Jeremiah, closely related in style to the 'temple sermon' (Jeremiah 7:1–8:3), in which a curse in announced 'upon anyone who does not heed the words of the Mosaic covenant' (verses 3–4), focusing on the point that 'the possession of the land hinges entirely upon obedience to the covenant' (verse 5). ""Speak"": Say to them, i.e. the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. ""Cursed is the man who does not obey the words of this covenant"": a citation from Deuteronomy 11:26–28; 27:26; 28:15–68, quoted by the apostle Paul in Galatians 3:10. The entire future of the community in the land is dependent on the covenant with YHWH as the formula ""I will be your God and you will be my people"" (verse 4) is linked closely to ""YHWH's oath to give them a land 'flowing with milk and honey'"".

"Christina Robertson RSA (née Saunders; 17 December 1796 – 30 April 1854) was a Scottish painter generally remembered for her portraits of Russian imperial family, representative of Academical tradition. She was the first woman honorary member of the Royal Scottish Academy. Saunders was born in Kinghorn in Fife in December 1796, to parents who wished her to be educated. She was trained by her uncle, George Sa(u)nders, who painted miniatures and she launched into her career based at his house in London. Saunders was a successful portrait painter and she rapidly established a flow of commissions initially from Scottish patrons for her miniatures but later for oil and watercolour paintings, earning more than her mentor. By 1823 she was married to artist James Robertson but her art overshadowed his, and she was exhibiting at the Royal Academy and by 1828 she had her own studio, perhaps the first woman to do so. The following year she became the first honorary woman member of the Royal Scottish Academy. During the 1830s, Robertson was travelling away from her family; although she gave birth to eight children, four of whom survived infancy. She worked in Paris in the mid 1830s and met members of the Russian Court, who could have already seen her work as engravings in magazines, and so she was tempted to join them in St Petersburg. There would have been more commissions than normal to replace the paintings lost in the fire that destroyed the Winter Palace in 1837. Saunders was in St Petersburg from 1839 to 1841 where she carried out full length painting of Tsar Nicholas I and Empress Alexandra and her three daughters - Maria, Olga and Alexandra. In 1841 she was the first, and only woman, to be made an honorary member, of the Imperial Academy of Arts. She stayed in St Petersburg working as royal artist for ten years, although portraits of the imperial daughters-in-law were rejected in 1849. One of the sitters, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna later commissioned Robertson to paint her and her children, and the Empress chose her to paint an updated portrait of herself, in 1852. Some of Roberston's portraits were engraved by 1833 and they were included in The portrait gallery of distinguished females including beauties of the courts of George IV and William IV with memoirs by John Burke. Robertson died in Saint Petersburg, and is buried in the Volkovo Cemetery. Robertson left dozens of paintings that are important if only because they record the portraits of historic figures, but many were thought to have been destroyed by Bolsheviks in the Russian Revolution. She is thought to be less well known than she might have been, due to the deterioration of the relationship between the British and Russian empires.",Normal

"The Hermetic Journal was a quarterly journal dedicated to the Hermetic tradition, edited by Adam McLean, and published by Megalithic Research Publications of Edinburgh. The first issue was released in August 1978 and publication continued until 1992. The Hermetic Journal explored alchemy and hermetic philosophy from various angles and attracted a wide range of contributors. It addressed a readership which had a deep interest in hermeticism and was primarily available only through subscription. Back issues of the Hermetic Journal are still available bound in paperback editions (about 176 pages), each covering a year. The Hermetic Journal had a small circulation of about three to four hundred readers. It built up a network of people interested in furthering the investigation of alchemy and hermetic philosophy. It is one of only a few English periodicals which focused on alchemy and the Hermetic tradition in the late twentieth century. Other periodicals of the time were the academic journals Ambix, and Cauda Pavonis, and publications by the Philosophers of Nature and the Paracelsus Research Society for members of their organizations. The Hermetic Journal distinguished itself by publishing over 1000 high quality articles. Often, these contained scholarly material from renowned authorities – such as Gareth Knight, Stephen Skinner, Ithell Colquhoun, Kenneth Rayner Johnson, R.A. Gilbert, Graham Knight, Hans Nintzel, Joseph Ritman, and Joscelyn Godwin. Uniquely, the Hermetic Journal was open to articles of a speculative nature but always tried to encourage scholarly research into hermetic philosophy.",Normal

"Ted Bami Minsende (born 2 March 1978 in Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo)) is a former professional boxer. Nicknamed ""Dangerous"", Bami is a former European light welterweight champion and British light welterweight title challenger. He was until recently the trainer of his nephew, British boxer Isaac Chamberlain. Bami and Chamberlain parted ways following Chamberlain's accusations of theft; however, in May 2018, the Boxing Board of Control cleared Bami of all accusations and he remained Chamberlain's Manager until 2020. Bami was born in Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) but has lived in Britain since the age of 12, having left Zaire to avoid the civil war in the country at that time. He was raised by his uncle who first introduced him to boxing at 15. Bami is self-managed and is trained by James Cook. Bami made his professional boxing debut in September 1998, with a first round stoppage of Des Sowden. In his second professional fight, Bami knocked out Gary Reid in the 2nd round of a scheduled 4 round contest. Reid would go on to challenge for the commonwealth light welterweight title. Bami's first setback came when he was knocked out by Jacek Bielski in his fourth fight. On 17 August 2002, Bami knocked out the previously undefeated Bradley Pryce in the 6th round. Pryce has since gone on to challenge for the British welterweight title and win the Commonwealth title in the light middleweight division. In April, 2003, Bami won the vacant World Boxing Federation (WBF) light welterweight title with a 9th round knockout of Vasile 'Laszlo' Herteg. On 26 July 2003, in his first defence of the title, Bami was knocked out by South African Samuel Malinga, who had previously defeated Colin Lynes. Following the defeat to Malinga, Bami spent the next couple of years fighting mid-level European opposition. During this period his biggest wins were over Hungarian Jozsef Matolcsi, Russian Viktor Baranov and Poland's Rafal Jackiewicz. On 14 September 2006, following an injury to Jason Cook, Bami received a late call to fight for the vacant European light welterweight title against Italian Giuseppe Lauri, who had previously lost against Ricky Hatton and Junior Witter. On 22 September 2006, despite having a point deducted for headbutting, Bami defeated Lauri via a unanimous points decision with scores of 117-112 twice and 118-111. On 30 March 2007, Bami scored another unanimous points decision over Lauri in a rematch for the title. Bami vacated the title following an injury. On 14 March 2008, Bami challenged David Barnes for the vacant British light welterweight title. Bami was defeated via a unanimous points decision, in a fight which Barnes controlled with his jab. In July, 2008, Bami returned to winning ways with a 7th round knockout of Stuart Elwell via a body shot. On 24 October 2008, Bami was defeated in the final of the 3rd Prizefighter tournament by Michael Lomax. Bami, favourite going into the tournament, defeated Andrew Ferrans via knockout and Mark Lloyd on points on his way to the final. On 28 March 2009, Bami was defeated by Matthew Hatton in a 6th round stoppage in an eliminator for the IBO welterweight Title.

"John Reeve (1799–1838) was an English comic actor. His early career was based on mimicry: he became a popular favourite, able to continue in highly paid work, despite drinking heavily and not learning his parts. The son of Thomas Reeve, a hosier and common councillor, and nephew of William Reeve and Robert Waithman, he was born at his father's shop on Ludgate Hill, on 2 February 1799. At school at Winchmore Hill under a Mr. Thompson, he had for companion Frederick Henry Yates. From age 14 behind his father's counter for two years, when his father retired, he was placed with a firm of wholesale hosiers named Nevill or Neville in Maiden Lane, Wood Street, lasting three years there. As a clerk in Gosling's Bank on Fleet Street, Reeve with colleagues hired every two weeks Pym's Theatre, Wilson Street, off Gray's Inn Road. Pym was an ex-actor, who had fitted up an assembly room as an upmarket ""private theatre"", a place for well-supported amateur theatricals. Finding himself in obscure parts, Reeve hired the house on his own account for £10, and played Othello, with his friend George Herbert Bonaparte Rodwell as Roderigo, and Sylvester Daggerwood, an actor, in a farce based on New Hay at the Old Market George Colman the younger. He repeated ""Sylvester Daggerwood"" on 8 and 9 June 1819 at Drury Lane, in benefits for Thomas Rodwell and Gesualdo Lanza; and then played it for a few nights at the Haymarket Theatre. Reeve was offered an engagement by Samuel James Arnold at the Lyceum Theatre. He appeared there on 17 July 1819, under the name of Mr. *****, as Harry Alias in One, Two, Three, Four, Five by Advertisement, by John Hamilton Reynolds; the cast included William Farren, John Pritt Harley, Charles Mathews, and Joseph Munden. He resigned his post at the bank, and he played two other characters, Pedrillo and Crack, at the Lyceum, but the press only gave him credit as a mimic. The Rodwells with Willis Jones took the Sans-Pareil Theatre in the Strand, and opened it on 18 October 1819 as the Adelphi Theatre. Reeve appeared there as Squire Rattlepate in William Thomas Moncrieff's burletta, The Green Dragon, or I've quite forgot, and Lord Grizzle in a burlesque of Tom Thumb. Feeling inexperienced, Reeve then joined William Macready the elder's company in Bristol, and for once took on comic Shakespearean characters. Back at the Adelphi, he succeeded Watkins Burroughs as Jerry Hawthorn in Moncrieff's adaptation from Pierce Egan's Tom and Jerry, or Life in London, a character he made his own. At the close of the season, he gave in 1823 at the Adelphi, with James Pimbury Wilkinson, an entertainment called Trifles light as Air, and declaimed a ""monopolylogue"", Bachelor's Torments; Wilkinson left, but he continued the entertainment alone. Reeve went on to play at the Surrey Theatre and the Cobourg Theatre, rising high in public estimation. On 17 April 1826, with a salary of £13 a week, he made as Ralph, a comic servant, in Prince Hoare's Lock and Key, what was inaccurately announced as his first appearance at the Haymarket. He had established his position in comedy, and opened the Haymarket season on 15 June 1827 with Paul Pry. On 17 June 1828 he reappeared as Figaro. In 1830 he played his last season at the Haymarket: quarrelling with the management on a question of terms, he played at the Adelphi, on 21 October 1830, Magog in John Baldwin Buckstone's Wreck Ashore, and then went to Covent Garden, where he was considered to have failed. It was with the Adelphi that Reeve's main triumphs in original parts were associated. After playing two years at the Queen's Theatre, he went, in 1835, to America, where he was well paid but did not win over the audience. Returning, at a salary of £40 a week to the Adelphi Theatre, now under the management of Frederick Henry Yates, Reeve appeared in a piece entitled Novelty, a framework for his American adventures. From early in his career, he had been a heavy drinker, often forgetting his lines. During 1836 he was to have played at the Surrey the main part in The Skeleton Witness, but at the final rehearsal he knew none of his words, and that night he sent a note of apology. Davidge, the manager, explained to the audience that the actor was being paid £30 a week. In 1837 Reeve played Sam Weller in the Peregrinations of Pickwick and was seen in other characters. Reeve's last appearance in 1837 was at the Surrey Theatre, with some of the Adelphi company. He performed poorly in a part he had chosen in a new drama, The Wandering Tribe, and returning from the theatre after the second show, he broke a blood-vessel. He died at his house, 46 Brompton Row, on 24 January 1838, and was buried in Brompton churchyard. His comedian replacement at the Adelphi was Henry Roxby Beverley. Douglas Bannister, biographer of Reeve, said he was just a farceur and droll, a follower of the style of William Oxberry. He was on winking terms with his audience, in a way not seen since George Frederick Cooke: the managers John Baldwin Buckstone and Richard Brinsley Peake fed him with short sentences, bywords, and opportunities for business, instead of speeches, which he would not learn. He remained a favourite with the public, and managers still hired him, knowing full well his drink problem and unreliability. Reeve was twice married. By his first wife, a Miss Aylett, daughter of an upholsterer in Finsbury, and a dancer in Macready's company, whom he married at Bristol in 1820, he left a son John, a burlesque actor; she died at his birth in 1822 at Swansea. By his second wife he had two daughters. Attribution This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:Lee, Sidney, ed. (1896). ""Reeve, John (1799-1838)"".

"Baron Henley is a title that has been created twice: first in the Peerage of Great Britain and then in the Peerage of Ireland. The first creation came in 1760 in favour of Sir Robert Henley, Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, when he was created Lord Henley, Baron of Grainge, in the County of Southampton. In 1764 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Northington. On the death of his son, the second Earl, both titles became extinct. Lady Elizabeth Henley, youngest daughter of the first Earl and co-heiress of the second Earl, married the diplomat Morton Eden. In 1799, the Henley title was revived when Eden was created Baron Henley, of Chardstock in the County of Dorset, in the Peerage of Ireland. Their son, the second Baron, assumed the surname of Henley in lieu of Eden and notably published a biography of his maternal grandfather. His son, the third Baron, sat as Liberal Member of Parliament for Northampton. In 1885 the Northington title was also revived when he was created Baron Northington, of Watford in the County of Northampton, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title gave the Barons an automatic seat in the House of Lords. The fourth baron Frederick Henley was an educated man who served as JP in Northamptonshire and married Augusta, daughter of Herbert Langham 12th baronet. His younger son, the sixth Baron, resumed the surname of Eden in 1925, the same year he succeeded his half-brother in the titles. As of 2019 the peerages are held by his grandson, the eighth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1977. He is a Conservative politician and served in the Conservative administrations of Margaret Thatcher, John Major and David Cameron. Lord Henley is now one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. The Barons Henley are members of the prominent Eden family. The first Baron was the fifth son of Sir Robert Eden, 3rd Baronet, of West Auckland, and the younger brother of William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland. Their elder brother Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland (second son of the third Baronet of West Auckland), was the great-great-grandfather of Prime Minister Anthony Eden, 1st Earl of Avon, and the great-great-great-grandfather of the Conservative politician John Benedict Eden, Baron Eden of Winton. The family seat is Scaleby Castle, near Carlisle, Cumbria. The heir apparent is the present holder's son, the Hon. John Michael Oliver Eden (born 1988).",Normal
"Wolstenholme Island (Greenlandic: Qeqertarssuaq) is an island in Baffin Bay, in Avannaata municipality, off northwestern Greenland. The island lies west of the Bylot Sound off Cape Atholl in the southern shore of the mouth of Wolstenholme Fjord, south of Saunders Island. It is smaller than the latter and made of gneiss. Under Commander James Saunders HMS North Star sailed to the Arctic in 1849 in the spring on a venture to search and resupply Captain Sir James Clark Ross' expedition, who in turn had sailed in 1848 trying to locate the whereabouts of Sir John Franklin's expedition. Failing to find Franklin or Ross, Saunders's mission aboard the North Star consisted in depositing stores along several named areas of the Canadian Arctic coast and returning to England before the onset of winter. However, James Saunders's ship's progress was hindered by large amounts of ice in Melville Bay and it finally became trapped by ice off the coast of northwestern Greenland in North Star Bay. A paper left by Saunders in a cairn reads thus: This paper is placed here to certify, that H.M.S, North Star was beset, at the east side of Melville Bay, on the 29th of July, last year, and gradually drifted from day to day, until, on the 26th of September, we found ourselves abreast of Wolstenholme Island; when perceiving the ice a little; more loose, and the Sound perfectly clear, we made all plain sail, and pressed her through it, anchoring in the lower part of the Sound that evening, and arrived in the Bay on the 1st of October, where she remained throughout the winter. During the winter 1849–50 Saunders named numerous landmarks in that area, including Wolstenholme Island, while wintering in the frozen bay. Adam Beck, John Ross' Inuit interpreter during his 1850 Third Arctic expedition, had told a grisly story —reportedly heard by him from Greenlandic Inuit— about a massacre of Franklin's men on Wolstenholme Island. Nevertheless, a thorough search of the island yielded no evidence and Adam Beck's story was discarded. The bay was the site of a Cold War nuclear accident when a B-52 bomber carrying four thermonuclear bombs crashed, spreading contaminated material over the area.

"APA Group (アパグループ, Apa Gurūpu), commonly known as APA (Always Pleasant Amenities), is a Japanese hospitality group that operates a chain of hotels in the country.

APA acquired the Vancouver-based Coast Hotels in 2016. There are plans to open more hotels in the U.S. in the future. APA Group distributes political propaganda written by its president, Toshio Motoya, a strong supporter of revisionist historical views aligned with those of Japan's far-right. For example, in a series of interviews published online from APA Group's magazine Apple Town, Motoya referred to Japanese aggression, the Nanjing Massacre, and the sex slavery of comfort women as ""fabricated stories created to dishonor Japan"" he claimed that having spoken to many important figures in the 81 countries he has visited and to many ambassadors to Japan that ""not a single person believes in things such as the Nanking Massacre or comfort women story..."" Such views are known to create negative feelings in neighboring countries such as China and South Korea. These publications are widely distributed in APA Hotels. In addition, Motoya disclosed in his books that he plans to give maximum support to the Abe administration to rebuke China and Korea on these historical issues. Some Chinese tourist organizations are boycotting the chain. The Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying stated that the China National Tourism Administration has requested to all Chinese companies and websites to not conduct business with APA, and for people to not go to their hotels, she said ""China is willing to have friendly interactions with Japan, but will never tolerate flagrant provocations distorting the history and offending the Chinese people."" In 2007, several APA hotels were discovered to have faked their earthquake safety data with some buildings having only 70 percent of the legally required structural strength.

"Spencer Joseph (born January 1, 1999), known professionally as That Kid, is an American singer, songwriter, and social media personality from Denver, Colorado. His debut single ""Dial Tone"" gained traction within the hyperpop subculture, a genre in which he has since become a prominent figure. Since then, he has released three full-length projects, Crush (2020), Comedown (2021), and Superstar (2022). That Kid is a member of the band Freakalicious, alongside Chase Icon and Ayesha Erotica. Spencer Joseph was born on January 1, 1999, in Denver, Colorado. Joseph began playing the cello at the age of 11, revealing an early interest in music. He began creating original music at 14 with a laptop and his father's old gaming headset, initially as a new hobby to replace his interest in art, particularly oil pastels. However, after a few months, he shifted to experimenting with singing and creating experimental R&B. Joseph pursued his passion for music and began taking singing lessons while actively participating in his school's choir. In 2017 and 2018, That Kid gained a following on the social media platform Twitter, which led to his collaboration with Slayyyter and Ayesha Erotica on his debut single, ""Dial Tone"", released on September 9, 2018. The single's success inspired him to pursue music full-time, releasing the singles ""80 Mph"" and ""Boyfriend"" later that year. In 2019, he released eight more singles: ""Take It Off"", ""Arcade"", ""Booty Call"", ""Rocket"", ""Penthouse"", ""Blindfold"", ""Mind Your Business"", and ""Fuck It Up"". He also appeared on the track ""E-Boy"" from Slayyyter's mixtape, Slayyyter (2019). On March 2, 2020, That Kid announced his debut mixtape Crush, which was released on March 31.

"Toyota TTC stands for Toyota Total Clean System, a moniker used in Japan to identify vehicles built with emission control technology. The technology was installed so that their vehicles would be in compliance with Japanese emission regulations passed in 1968. The term was introduced in Japan, with an externally mounted badge on the trunk of vehicles equipped. The technology first appeared in January 1975 on the Toyota Crown, the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Carina, the Toyota Corolla, and the Toyota Sprinter. There were three different versions initially introduced, called TTC-C for Catalyst, installing a catalytic converter, TTC-V for Vortex, installing an exhaust gas recirculation valve, and TTC-L which used a lean burn method. As Toyota's technology evolved the three systems were eventually used in conjunction in future models. The TTC-V was a licensed copy of Honda's CVCC system, and was introduced in February 1975. It was only available in the Carina and Corona lines, and only on the 19R engine, a modified 18R. From March 1976 the TTC-V system was upgraded to meet the stricter yet 1976 emissions standards. The TTC-V engine was discontinued in 1977. The ""Vortex"" approach was also used with Mitsubishi's MCA-Jet technology, with Mitsubishi installing an extra valve in the cylinder head, as opposed to Honda's pre-chamber approach. Toyota installed its emission control technology in select Daihatsu vehicles, as Toyota was a part owner. The system was labeled ""DECS"" (Daihatsu Economical Cleanup System). The first version to be installed was the DECS-C (catalyst) in the Daihatsu Charmant and the Consorte. As the Japanese emissions regulations continued to be tightened, the DECS-C system was replaced by the DECS-L (lean burn) method which was also installed in the Daihatsu Fellow, on the Daihatsu A-series engine, the Daihatsu Charade, and the Daihatsu Delta.

"In geometry, the twin circles are two special circles associated with an arbelos. An arbelos is determined by three collinear points A, B, and C, and is the curvilinear triangular region between the three semicircles that have AB, BC, and AC as their diameters. If the arbelos is partitioned into two smaller regions by a line segment through the middle point of A, B, and C, perpendicular to line ABC, then each of the two twin circles lies within one of these two regions, tangent to its two semicircular sides and to the splitting segment. These circles first appeared in the Book of Lemmas, which showed (Proposition V) that the two circles are congruent. Thābit ibn Qurra, who translated this book into Arabic, attributed it to Greek mathematician Archimedes. Based on this claim the twin circles, and several other circles in the Arbelos congruent to them, have also been called Archimedes's circles. However, this attribution has been questioned by later scholarship. Specifically, let A {displaystyle A} , B {displaystyle B} , and C {displaystyle C} be the three corners of the arbelos, with B {displaystyle B} between A {displaystyle A} and C {displaystyle C} . Let D {displaystyle D} be the point where the larger semicircle intercepts the line perpendicular to the A C {displaystyle AC} through the point B {displaystyle B} . The segment B D {displaystyle BD} divides the arbelos in two parts. The twin circles are the two circles inscribed in these parts, each tangent to one of the two smaller semicircles, to the segment B D {displaystyle BD} , and to the largest semicircle. Each of the two circles is uniquely determined by its three tangencies. Constructing it is a special case of the Problem of Apollonius. Alternative approaches to constructing two circles congruent to the twin circles have also been found. These circles have also been called Archimedean circles. They include the Bankoff circle, Schoch circles, and Woo circles. Let a and b be the diameters of two inner semicircles, so that the outer semicircle has diameter a+b. The diameter of each twin circle is then Alternatively, if the outer semicircle has unit diameter, and the inner circles have diameters s {displaystyle s} and 1 − s {displaystyle 1-s} , the diameter of each twin circle is The smallest circle that encloses both twin circles has the same area as the arbelos.",Normal
"This is a summary of 2002 in music in the United Kingdom, including the official charts from that year. In 2002, as in the previous year, there were 30 songs that reached the top of the charts. Although there were numerous songs that remained at the top for only a week, several managed to carry out runs of two or more weeks, none achieving above four. The UK also celebrated the 50th anniversary of the UK singles chart. After the Popstars phenomenon of the previous year, the UK became obsessed with talent show winners and the new show Pop Idol became a huge success. The year was thought of as the 2nd Golden Age of Hip-Hop music with many successful artists with Eminem coming out at top once again. The first week of the month was the last week at the top for 2001's Christmas chart topper, a modern rendition of ""Somethin' Stupid"", a duet by Robbie Williams and actress Nicole Kidman. Returning to the top for one final week was Daniel Bedingfield's debut single, ""Gotta Get Thru This"". It broke the record for lowest weekly sale for a number one single, selling only 25,500 copies in that week. The single was to decline slightly during 2002, but rapidly after the year's end. The remainder of the month was to be incredibly morbid. Dying in a plane crash in the summer of 2001 at the young age of 22, R'n'B vocalist, Aaliyah hit the top with her posthumous release, ""More Than a Woman"". She had broken a record in the US, becoming the first artist to make No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100 based solely upon airplay points, with her single ""Try Again"". Overtaking her was what made this month significant. The youngest Beatle, George Harrison, died in November 2001 after a long struggle with cancer. His No. 1 from 1971, ""My Sweet Lord"" was re-issued and shot straight to the top of the charts. Though it only remained there a week, it entered the record books, being the first time in UK chart history a posthumous release has taken over from another posthumous release by another artist. Returning to number one after April in 2001, the Stereophonics returned to the top with their third album, Just Enough Education to Perform. Spawning two No. 5 singles, the album remained at the top for 3 weeks in this return, one more week than its original stay. This made its total number of weeks at the top 5. This became their 2nd UK album chart topper, and a 3rd was to follow the following year. Spanish performer Enrique Iglesias was next to hit the top with what many see as his UK Breakthrough (though he had two top tens two years prior) with the single release of the ballad ""Hero"" which stayed at the top for four weeks. He made himself and his father Julio Iglesias the first fatherson combination to top the charts separately and as solo artists. His father had hit the top of the UK charts over 20 years prior with his cover version of ""Begin The Beguine"". ""Hero"" was taken from his chart topping album Escape which made him the first act to top the single and album charts simultaneously in five years and spawned a No. 3 hit ""Escape"" and two No. 12 hits by December. Taking over from the Stereophonics were fusion kings, the Chemical Brothers, with their 3rd No. 1 album, Come With Us. Despite having received success on the albums chart throughout their career, they hadn't received a chart topping single since early 1997. Topping the charts alongside his only number one single, Enrique's second English album, Escape topped the charts for 2 weeks making him the first Latin Artist to have a number one single and album simultaneously in the UK as well as the first person since the Spice Girls. Overtaking the totals of pop phenomena Spice Girls and ABBA, Westlife hit the top for a record 10th time, with their third release from their third album, ""World Of Our Own"". The album of the same name, became their second consecutive No. 1 album. They now had as many number ones as the queen of pop herself, Madonna. They also were the act to obtain 10 chart toppers the quickest (now 5 acts had achieved 10 or more) with only 35 months between this and their first. However, it could be said this record is unfair, because it was only a few months after that the Beatles managed to achieve 10, but they tended to spend several weeks at the summit, slowing down their release rate, whereas most of Westlife's #1's spent one to two weeks at the top. Taking over was the fastest selling debut single in UK chart history. Winner of the TV talent show, Pop Idol, Will Young had been voted as the winner by over 4 million people in the final. Despite the media suggesting this was unexpected, Young actually won six out of the nine weeks with Gareth Gates the eventually runner-up winning three times. His debut single ""Anything is PossibleEvergreen"", topped the charts for 3 weeks and sold over 1.1 million copies in its first week of sale, making it the fastest selling debut single in UK chart history. Altogether it sold over 1.7 million copies becoming the 11th biggest selling single in the UK. It is also the second fastest selling single in the UK with only Elton John's ""Candle in the Wind"" ahead of it. It became the biggest selling single of the year. A 2-week run at the top was next from veteran band The Police. Experiencing massive success in the early 1980s with 5 No. 1 singles, lead singer Sting eventually went solo and became a very successful and highly respected musician, especially in the US. A combination of his greatest hits and the Police's greatest hits was released entitled The Very Best of Sting & The Police. Greatest hits took over from greatest hits when The Essential Barbra Streisand replaced Sting & The Police at the top, however after a week it was knocked off by rock band, Nickelback with their 3rd studio album, Silver Side Up. The album spawned a massive No. 4 hit, ""How You Remind Me"", which made No. 1 in the US. Taking over from the winner of the show, Pop Idol, runner up Gareth Gates scored a No. 1 with his debut single, ""Unchained Melody"". Incredibly he spent one further week at the summit than Will Young did, becoming the second single of the year to have a four-week run at #1. However, the single itself sold less than Will Young's, selling only 1.3 million copies, but nonetheless it became the 77th million selling single in the UK and the last one until 2004. Overall, it is the 37th biggest selling single in the UK. The more incredible thing about this song is that it is the fourth single to reach the summit 4 times by different artists. First was Jimmy Young in 1955, then a re-issue of The Righteous Brothers in 1990, then the acting duo Robson & Jerome took it the top in 1995 and finally Gareth Gates in 2002. Robson & Jerome's version remains the biggest selling to date. Scoring their sixth UK chart topper Oasis returned to the top of the UK charts with a track similar to their older material, ""The Hindu Times"". The track was taken off their new album, Heathen Chemistry. It only lasted a week at the summit, following the same fate as every other No. 1 single they had. The top of the albums chart was dominated by a lady with a powerful voice and her 5th UK No. 1 album, Céline Dion with A New Day Has Come. Staying at the top for 4 weeks, she did not hit the top again for the next two years, but continued charting throughout. The album's singles did not fare as well as the album, one making the Top 10, one settling in the Top 20 and one just creeping into the Top 40. Having charted since 2000, UK girl group Sugababes (who were now under their second line-up of original members Keisha Buchanan, Mutya Buena and former Atomic Kitten member Heidi Range, who replaced Siobhán Donaghy after her departure the previous year) scored their first UK number one with their 5th single, ""Freak like Me"". The song was originally performed by Adina Howard in 1995 who took it to No. 33 – the group's version took the lyrics and placed them over an interpolated sample of Gary Numan and Tubeway Army's Are 'Friends' Electric?, itself a UK number one from 1979. After a short spell of 7 days, a third Neighbours star scored a UK No.1. Holly Valance's debut single, ""Kiss Kiss"" was originally released in Europe written in Turkish. Holly scored a No. 2 hit, ""Down Boy"" later on in the year and her debut album, Footprints made #9. After releasing 2 further singles, she disappeared from the music scene. With his fifth consecutive Top 10 single and 3rd UK No. 1, Ronan Keating returns to the top of the singles chart with the first release off his new album Destination. ""If Tomorrow Never Comes"" was originally a hit in the US for Garth Brooks. Continuing the run of one week number ones were Liberty X. The five losers who just failed to make Hear'Say in the talent show Popstars formed Liberty X. Despite scoring only one UK No. 1 single with Just a Little, the group continued successfully into 20034 and proved themselves to be more successful than Hear'Say, who disbanded in October of this year. Also, after not releasing a single in the United Kingdom for almost 11 months, Atomic Kitten released their 9th single, titled It's Ok!, peaked at No. 3 on the charts, and eventually went silver. Even bigger success was to follow with their next release. Also scoring big success were S Club Juniors, an 8-piece pre-teen spin off from their already successful predecessors S Club 7 (who saw the departure of band member Paul Cattermole earlier that year). After being chosen from nationwide auditions to support S Club 7 on their arena tour, their debut single One Step Closer sent them straight to number 2, a position they also reached later in the year with their next two releases ""Automatic High"" in August and ""New Direction"" in October. Despite the split of the remaining six members of S Club 7 the following year, and a name change to S Club 8 they would go on to release two top 20 albums and score 7 top 20 singles before they disbanded in early 2005. Frankie Sandford and Rochelle Wiseman from the group, however, would re-emerge 5 years later in new girl group The Saturdays. Nearly six months after its release, boyband Blue hit the top with their debut album, All Rise. The album had already spawned two number one singles by this point, ""Too Close"" and ""If You Come Back"" the previous year. The title track from their album, which was their debut single had also made No. 4 and a fourth single, ""Fly by II"" reached No. 6 in March of this year. It was only a week before British indie rock band, Doves hit the top with their 2nd album, The Last Broadcast which remained at the top for 2 weeks. It was quickly knocked off by American electronic musician Moby with his 2nd UK No. 1 album, 18. Despite having charted since 1991 he has only received 2 Top 10 hits. On 23 May, the Classical Brits award ceremony took place. The most successful British performers were Sir Colin Davis, Russell Watson and Guy Johnston. Consolidating his position as the rapper with the most UK chart toppers, Eminem hit the top for a third time with the first single from his third album, ""Without Me"". The album spent 5 weeks at the top of the UK charts, becoming the second longest stay of the year and the longest stay until December. The album, The Eminem Show was to become his most successful to date in the UK along with Curtain Call in 2005. Will Young hit the top again with his second single ""Light My Fire"", a cover of a classic Doors track which only made No. 49 in 1967. He had performed this on the show, Pop Idol, and the performance was praised highly by the general public. The single was successful, topping the charts for 2 weeks. As for the albums chart, first to hit the top was Ronan Keating with his second album, Destination. The album had already spawned a No. 1 single, ""If Tomorrow Never Comes"". Ronan continued to chart into 2004. Becoming another single to spend 4 weeks at the top, ""A Little Less Conversation"" ended an ongoing chart battle since 1977. Elvis accumulated 15 chart toppers by 1965, during which the Beatles were enjoying their time as global megastars. They then got a record 17 chart toppers by 1969, when they finally began to fade. Elvis scored a 16th chart topper in 1970, when he revived his career in Las Vegas. Then a single made just before his death was released after his death in May 1977 and went straight to No.1, giving him his 17th UK #1. The two biggest music acts in the UK were neck and neck, and despite numerous posthumous releases, it wasn't until 25 years later that one of them finally took the lead. It was indeed the king of pop, Elvis Presley, who scored his 18th UK No. 1, with a remix of an old hit from a long forgotten movie. ""A Little Less Conversation"" was remixed by DJ JXL, and used in a Nike World Cup advertisement. As a consequence, it shot straight to the top of the UK charts putting Elvis at the top of the most #1's category. Taking over was Gareth Gates, scoring his second No.1 single this time with an original song, being one of his few singles to have not been cover versions. ""Anyone Of Us (Stupid Mistake)"" topped the charts for 3 weeks, bettering Will Young by one week once again. Topping the albums chart for the fourth time, Oasis hit the top with their new album, Heathen Chemistry. The album's singles had already received success with ""The Hindu Times"" becoming their 6th No. 1 and the follow-up single, ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out"" peaking at #2. The album, however, only spent a week at the top quickly overtaken by the first release in 2 years from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, By the Way. The title track from the album became their highest-charting single ever, making #2. This was also their only No. 1 album. Hitting the top was Darius Danesh, third in Pop Idol. ""Colourblind"" spent two weeks at the top, but despite being less successful than the debuts of Gareth or Will, Darius wrote the song himself. The Sugababes hit the top for a second time with their sixth single, ""Round Round"". Like their first No. 1 single, it only spent a week at the summit. The song was taken from the soundtrack to the hit film, ""The Guru"". Specialising in PopR'N'B with garage influences, all-male act, Blazin' Squad entered at the top of the charts with their massively hyped debut single, ""Crossroads"". Their success slowly decline throughout their career. Interrupting the Chili's run at the top was US singing legend, Bruce Springsteen hit the top with his 5th No. 1 album, The Rising. His success on the singles chart was fading rapidly since the early 1990s, with no Top 10 hits since 1994. Returning to the top for a further 2 weeks were the Chili's with By the Way. Having been a successful band throughout the 1980s the 1990s was a slightly quieter decade for the group, but the release of Californication turned them around in 2000 and By the Way helped propel them straight to the top. Scoring a 2nd consecutive UK No. 1 album, another collection of the late Eva Cassidy's work was compiled and released. Imagine was not quite as successful as Songbird, only topping the chart for a week, but put her on the way to breaking a chart record the following year. Reviving an old number one for the second time to create another one for themselves were girl group Atomic Kitten. This time it was Blondie's 1980 chart topper ""The Tide Is High"", which they changed slightly to make ""The Tide Is High (Get the Feeling)"". It topped the charts for three weeks and after this they never saw the top of the charts again in the United Kingdom, however they had managed three number-one singles in the UK throughout their career. They split at the beginning of 2004, releasing a Greatest Hits album. US solo performer, Pink scored her first solo chart topper with a track taken from her second album, Missundaztood. The track was called ""Just Like a Pill"" and gave P!nk her second UK number one. Her album Missundaztood only peaked at number 2 despite producing several hit singles. Increasing their popularity even further, Coldplay released their second album, and follow up to massive successful Parachutes. A Rush of Blood to the Head became a great success. Containing hits such as ""In My Place"", ""The Scientist"" & ""Clocks"", the album even sustained their popularity in the US and they became one of the few 21st century British acts to achieve fame and popularity in the US. While topping the singles charts with their third and final number one, Atomic Kitten scored a No. 1 album with their 3rd release, Feels So Good. The album spawned two top 3 hits as well as their 3rd chart topper. After both having two chart toppers, the two ""Pop Idols"", Will Young and Gareth Gates joined forces and revived an old Beatles classic, ""The Long and Winding Road"". It gave them both their third UK chart topper and established both of them as national stars. However, it was from here that Gareth would slowly decline and Will would rise to become an even bigger star. The B-side to this was Gareth's re-working of Elvis' classic No. 2 from 1969, ""Suspicious Minds"". Will Young's version of Jackie Wilson's"" Sweetest Feeling"" also appeared on the B-side. The year was proving to be very successful for Elvis in many ways and there was one great album success to still be received. Next to hit the top, but only for a week were three Spanish sisters, Las Ketchup with a holiday novelty song ""The Ketchup Song (Asjere)"". What was probably considered the tune of 2002 came next and was a duet between US rapper Nelly and Kelly Rowland, a member of Destiny's Child. She was the only one out of the three from her old group experiencing success as a solo artist, but she soon would be overtaken by Beyoncé Knowles. ""Dilemma"" became a song no-one would ever forget and stayed on top of the charts for 2 weeks. It also topped the charts in the US. Nelly experienced much greater success in his home country compared to the UK. Gathering every No. 1 single Elvis had experienced in both the UK and US, a collection of 30 songs plus ""A Little Less Conversation"" as a bonus track was released on an album, entitled Elv1s – 30 Number 1 Hits. The king of pop clocked up more sales, staying on top for 2 weeks. He was replaced by Pop Idol Will Young, who scored his first No. 1 album, with 'From Now On'. The album contained his first 3 singles, all of which had topped the chart. The album stayed at the top of the charts for 2 weeks. The album spawned one final hit, which peaked at #2. Based in Germany, Spanish producer, DJ Sammy, featuring Yanou and Do on vocals re-worked an old Bryan Adams track from 1985, ""Heaven"" and took it to the top. Bryan Adams only managed to take the track to #38. Only lasting a week at the summit, the song was quickly overtaken by the boyband that could do no wrong. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the UK charts, since when they first started back in 1952, the 941st No.1 came from Westlife yet again, with their 11th No. 1 single, ""Unbreakable"". This gave them more chart toppers than the queen of pop herself, Madonna. Only Elvis Presley, the Beatles and Cliff Richard had received more No. 1 singles than Westlife now. After a week, US superstar, Christina Aguilera returned to the top of the UK charts for the 3rd time promoting a new raunchier image with her first single from her second album, Stripped. ""Dirrty"" came with an overtly sexual video and despite its massive popularity in the UK, it failed to reach the Top 20 in her US homeland. US rock band, the Foo Fighters scored their first No. 1 album with their fourth release, One By One. All of the band's three previous albums had gone Top 10, two of them going Top 3. However, after a week, the singer David Gray took over from them with his second album, A New Day At Midnight. It stayed on top for a week but was nowhere near as successful as its predecessor, White Ladder. Blue returned to the top of the album chart, again for one week only, with their second release, One Love, which would provide them with three more top 10 hits, including their third and final UK No. 1 the following month. Compiling all of their singles to date, boyband Westlife released Unbreakable – The Greatest Hits – Vol 1 containing their 11 No. 1 singles and other hits. It was quickly knocked off by the biggest selling album of the year, which topped the charts all through December and part of January. Twelve months after he hit the top with his debut single, Daniel Bedingfield returned to the top with a slow ballad, ""If You're Not The One"". It became his 2nd UK No. 1 and was the third release from his debut album, Gotta Get Thru This, which despite producing 5 Top 10 singles and 6 Top 40 hits only managed to make No. 13 in the albums chart. A fourth chart topper confirmed Eminem as the most successful rapper in UK chart history. The song, ""Lose Yourself"" is taken from the soundtrack to his own film, 8 Mile, which also proved very popular. The song also topped the charts in the US. Boy band Blue returned to the top of the UK charts for the 3rd time collaborating with Elton John to revive an old hit of his, ""Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word"". Amazingly, despite charting for 31 years, this was only Elton's 5th UK No. 1 single. Popstars: The Rivals became the new phenomenon in the world of talent shows and it produced 2 new acts, boyband One True Voice and girl group Girls Aloud. They both released their singles in Christmas week and the girls beat the boys to the top spot, claiming the Christmas number one with their debut single, ""Sound of the Underground"". The song topped the charts for 4 weeks, and escalated them to great fame. They have had continued success for 6 years releasing 20 top 10 singles and 6 successful albums, but One True Voice quickly disappeared from the music scene after just one more hit. Robbie Williams took the Christmas number one album spot yet again with his fifth No. 1 album, Escapology. The album contained the massive single hit, ""Feel"" and the soon to be single hits, ""Come Undone"", ""Something Beautiful"" and ""Sexed Up"". The album remained on top for 6 weeks, becoming the longest stay at the top since he himself topped the charts last year in December, when Swing When You're Winning topped the charts for 7 weeks. Amazingly, the album did return to the top the following year almost nine months after it was first released. It became one of the few albums to drop out of the Top 40 and climb back in to reach the top spot again. The year produced several new classical works by British composers, including Derek Bourgeois's Symphony No. 9 and Peter Maxwell Davies's Naxos Quartet No. 1. The biggest classical hit of 2002, however, was Tolga Kashif's Queen Symphony, which used themes from works by Queen to create a full-length orchestral work. Patrick Hawes wrote his first film score, for The Incredible Mrs Ritchie, directed by Paul Johansson. Howard Goodall followed up his earlier successful TV series Howard Goodall's Big Bangs with Howard Goodall's Great Dates, in which he focused on significant dates in the history of music.

"The Tonelli–Shanks algorithm (referred to by Shanks as the RESSOL algorithm) is used in modular arithmetic to solve for r in a congruence of the form r2 ≡ n (mod p), where p is a prime: that is, to find a square root of n modulo p. Tonelli–Shanks cannot be used for composite moduli: finding square roots modulo composite numbers is a computational problem equivalent to integer factorization. An equivalent, but slightly more redundant version of this algorithm was developed by Alberto Tonelli in 1891. The version discussed here was developed independently by Daniel Shanks in 1973, who explained: My tardiness in learning of these historical references was because I had lent Volume 1 of Dickson's History to a friend and it was never returned. According to Dickson, Tonelli's algorithm can take square roots of x modulo prime powers pλ apart from primes. Given a non-zero n {displaystyle n} and a prime p > 2 {displaystyle p>2} (which will always be odd), Euler's criterion tells us that n {displaystyle n} has a square root (i.e., n {displaystyle n} is a quadratic residue) if and only if: In contrast, if a number z {displaystyle z} has no square root (is a non-residue), Euler's criterion tells us that: It is not hard to find such z {displaystyle z} , because half of the integers between 1 and p − 1 {displaystyle p-1} have this property. So we assume that we have access to such a non-residue. By (normally) dividing by 2 repeatedly, we can write p − 1 {displaystyle p-1} as Q 2 S {displaystyle Q2^{S}} , where Q {displaystyle Q} is odd. Note that if we try then R 2 ≡ n Q + 1 = ( n ) ( n Q ) ( mod p ) {displaystyle R^{2}equiv n^{Q+1}=(n)(n^{Q}){pmod {p}}} . If t ≡ n Q ≡ 1 ( mod p ) {displaystyle tequiv n^{Q}equiv 1{pmod {p}}} , then R {displaystyle R} is a square root of n {displaystyle n} . Otherwise, for M = S {displaystyle M=S} , we have R {displaystyle R} and t {displaystyle t} satisfying: If, given a choice of R {displaystyle R} and t {displaystyle t} for a particular M {displaystyle M} satisfying the above (where R {displaystyle R} is not a square root of n {displaystyle n} ), we can easily calculate another R {displaystyle R} and t {displaystyle t} for M − 1 {displaystyle M-1} such that the above relations hold, then we can repeat this until t {displaystyle t} becomes a 2 0 {displaystyle 2^{0}} -th root of 1, i.e., t = 1 {displaystyle t=1} . At that point R {displaystyle R} is a square root of n {displaystyle n} . We can check whether t {displaystyle t} is a 2 M − 2 {displaystyle 2^{M-2}} -th root of 1 by squaring it M − 2 {displaystyle M-2} times and check whether it is 1. If it is, then we do not need to do anything, as the same choice of R {displaystyle R} and t {displaystyle t} works. But if it is not, t 2 M − 2 {displaystyle t^{2^{M-2}}} must be -1 (because squaring it gives 1, and there can only be two square roots 1 and -1 of 1 modulo p {displaystyle p} ). To find a new pair of R {displaystyle R} and t {displaystyle t} , we can multiply R {displaystyle R} by a factor b {displaystyle b} , to be determined. Then t {displaystyle t} must be multiplied by a factor b 2 {displaystyle b^{2}} to keep R 2 ≡ n t ( mod p ) {displaystyle R^{2}equiv nt{pmod {p}}} . So, when t 2 M − 2 {displaystyle t^{2^{M-2}}} is -1, we need to find a factor b 2 {displaystyle b^{2}} so that t b 2 {displaystyle tb^{2}} is a 2 M − 2 {displaystyle 2^{M-2}} -th root of 1, or equivalently b 2 {displaystyle b^{2}} is a 2 M − 2 {displaystyle 2^{M-2}} -th root of -1. The trick here is to make use of z {displaystyle z} , the known non-residue. The Euler's criterion applied to z {displaystyle z} shown above says that z Q {displaystyle z^{Q}} is a 2 S − 1 {displaystyle 2^{S-1}} -th root of -1. So by squaring z Q {displaystyle z^{Q}} repeatedly, we have access to a sequence of 2 i {displaystyle 2^{i}} -th root of -1. We can select the right one to serve as b {displaystyle b} . With a little bit of variable maintenance and trivial case compression, the algorithm below emerges naturally. Operations and comparisons on elements of the multiplicative group of integers modulo p Z p Z {displaystyle mathbb {Z} pmathbb {Z} } are implicitly mod p. Inputs: Outputs: Algorithm: Once you have solved the congruence with r the second solution is − r ( mod p ) {displaystyle -r{pmod {p}}} . If the least i such that t 2 i = 1 {displaystyle t^{2^{i}}=1} is M, then no solution to the congruence exists, i.e. n is not a quadratic residue. This is most useful when p ≡ 1 (mod 4). For primes such that p ≡ 3 (mod 4), this problem has possible solutions r = ± n p + 1 4 ( mod p ) {displaystyle r=pm n^{frac {p+1}{4}}{pmod {p}}} . If these satisfy r 2 ≡ n ( mod p ) {displaystyle r^{2}equiv n{pmod {p}}} , they are the only solutions. If not, r 2 ≡ − n ( mod p ) {displaystyle r^{2}equiv -n{pmod {p}}} , n is a quadratic non-residue, and there are no solutions. We can show that at the start of each iteration of the loop the following loop invariants hold: Initially: At each iteration, with M' , c' , t' , R' the new values replacing M, c, t, R: From t 2 M − 1 = 1 {displaystyle t^{2^{M-1}}=1} and the test against t = 1 at the start of the loop, we see that we will always find an i in 0 < i < M such that t 2 i = 1 {displaystyle t^{2^{i}}=1} . M is strictly smaller on each iteration, and thus the algorithm is guaranteed to halt. When we hit the condition t = 1 and halt, the last loop invariant implies that R2 = n. We can alternately express the loop invariants using the order of the elements: Each step of the algorithm moves t into a smaller subgroup by measuring the exact order of t and multiplying it by an element of the same order. Solving the congruence r2 ≡ 5 (mod 41). 41 is prime as required and 41 ≡ 1 (mod 4). 5 is a quadratic residue by Euler's criterion: 5 41 − 1 2 = 5 20 = 1 {displaystyle 5^{frac {41-1}{2}}=5^{20}=1} (as before, operations in ( Z 41 Z ) × {displaystyle (mathbb {Z} 41mathbb {Z} )^{times }} are implicitly mod 41). Indeed, 282 ≡ 5 (mod 41) and (−28)2 ≡ 132 ≡ 5 (mod 41). So the algorithm yields the two solutions to our congruence. The Tonelli–Shanks algorithm requires (on average over all possible input (quadratic residues and quadratic nonresidues)) modular multiplications, where m {displaystyle m} is the number of digits in the binary representation of p {displaystyle p} and k {displaystyle k} is the number of ones in the binary representation of p {displaystyle p} . If the required quadratic nonresidue z {displaystyle z} is to be found by checking if a randomly taken number y {displaystyle y} is a quadratic nonresidue, it requires (on average) 2 {displaystyle 2} computations of the Legendre symbol. The average of two computations of the Legendre symbol are explained as follows: y {displaystyle y} is a quadratic residue with chance p + 1 2 p = 1 + 1 p 2 {displaystyle {tfrac {tfrac {p+1}{2}}{p}}={tfrac {1+{tfrac {1}{p}}}{2}}} , which is smaller than 1 {displaystyle 1} but ≥ 1 2 {displaystyle geq {tfrac {1}{2}}} , so we will on average need to check if a y {displaystyle y} is a quadratic residue two times. This shows essentially that the Tonelli–Shanks algorithm works very well if the modulus p {displaystyle p} is random, that is, if S {displaystyle S} is not particularly large with respect to the number of digits in the binary representation of p {displaystyle p} . As written above, Cipolla's algorithm works better than Tonelli–Shanks if (and only if) S ( S − 1 ) > 8 m + 20 {displaystyle S(S-1)>8m+20} . However, if one instead uses Sutherland's algorithm to perform the discrete logarithm computation in the 2-Sylow subgroup of F p {displaystyle mathbb {F} _{p}} , one may replace S ( S − 1 ) {displaystyle S(S-1)} with an expression that is asymptotically bounded by O ( S log ⁡ S log ⁡ log ⁡ S ) {displaystyle O(Slog Slog log S)} . Explicitly, one computes e {displaystyle e} such that c e ≡ n Q {displaystyle c^{e}equiv n^{Q}} and then R ≡ c − e 2 n ( Q + 1 ) 2 {displaystyle Requiv c^{-e2}n^{(Q+1)2}} satisfies R 2 ≡ n {displaystyle R^{2}equiv n} (note that e {displaystyle e} is a multiple of 2 because n {displaystyle n} is a quadratic residue). The algorithm requires us to find a quadratic nonresidue z {displaystyle z} . There is no known deterministic algorithm that runs in polynomial time for finding such a z {displaystyle z} . However, if the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true, there exists a quadratic nonresidue z < 2 ln 2 ⁡ p {displaystyle z<2ln ^{2}{p}} , making it possible to check every z {displaystyle z} up to that limit and find a suitable z {displaystyle z} within polynomial time. Keep in mind, however, that this is a worst-case scenario; in general, z {displaystyle z} is found in on average 2 trials as stated above. The Tonelli–Shanks algorithm can (naturally) be used for any process in which square roots modulo a prime are necessary. For example, it can be used for finding points on elliptic curves. It is also useful for the computations in the Rabin cryptosystem and in the sieving step of the quadratic sieve. Tonelli–Shanks can be generalized to any cyclic group (instead of ( Z p Z ) × {displaystyle (mathbb {Z} pmathbb {Z} )^{times }} ) and to kth roots for arbitrary integer k, in particular to taking the kth root of an element of a finite field. If many square-roots must be done in the same cyclic group and S is not too large, a table of square-roots of the elements of 2-power order can be prepared in advance and the algorithm simplified and sped up as follows. According to Dickson's ""Theory of Numbers"" A. Tonelli gave an explicit formula for the roots of x 2 = c ( mod p λ ) {displaystyle x^{2}=c{pmod {p^{lambda }}}}  The Dickson reference shows the following formula for the square root of x 2 mod p λ {displaystyle x^{2}{bmod {p^{lambda }}}} . Noting that 23 2 mod 29 3 ≡ 529 {displaystyle 23^{2}{bmod {29^{3}}}equiv 529} and noting that β = 7 ⋅ 29 2 {displaystyle beta =7cdot 29^{2}} then To take another example: 2333 2 mod 29 3 ≡ 4142 {displaystyle 2333^{2}{bmod {29^{3}}}equiv 4142} and Dickson also attributes the following equation to Tonelli: Using p = 23 {displaystyle p=23} and using the modulus of p 3 {displaystyle p^{3}} the math follows: First, find the modular square root mod p {displaystyle p} which can be done by the regular Tonelli algorithm: And applying Tonelli's equation (see above): Dickson's reference clearly shows that Tonelli's algorithm works on moduli of p λ {displaystyle p^{lambda }} .",Normal
"Haji Mohammed Ayub (born April 15, 1984) is a citizen of China, who was held in extrajudicial detention in the United States Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba. The Department of Defense reports he was born on April 15, 1984, in Toqquztash, China. Ayub is one of approximately two dozen detainees from the Uyghur ethnic group. Ayub was one of the five Uyghurs whose Combatant Status Review Tribunal determined that he was not an enemy combatant and was transferred to an Albanian refugee camp. On June 15, 2008, the McClatchy News Service published articles based on interviews with 66 former Guantanamo captives. McClatchy reporters interviewed Mohammed Ayub. Mohammed Ayub told interviewers he found the conditions in Guantanamo so harsh that he dropped from 164 to 105 pounds, and that he was so hungry he was reduced to eating orange peels. He told interviewers captives were punished harshly for small infractions, like having an extra napkin. In spite of his treatment in Guantanamo Mohammed Ayub told reporters he would still like to move to the USA. He has relatives who live in America, and in 2001 he had a student visa for the USA. However, a friend he was traveling with did not, and he decided to postpone his travel until his friend had a visa, too. Mohammed Ayub described the interrogations the captives went through when Chinese security officials visited Guantanamo as: ...nothing more than threats. They told me they knew my family, where I'd lived, when I'd left China, where I'd traveled. I would be imprisoned if I ever tried to return to China. It was frightening, they got to us inside that place.

"SkyMall is a specialty publishing firm headquartered in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, best known for once publishing a self-titled in-flight publication, SkyMall, that at one point had an annual circulation of approximately 20 million copies distributed in airplane seat pockets. At one point, it reached 88% of US airlines passengers. SkyMall is a multi-channel, direct marketer offering products through direct marketers and manufacturers through its SkyMall catalogue and website, skymall.com. In January 2015, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In April 2015, it was purchased in bankruptcy court by C&A Marketing. SkyMall, Inc. was founded in 1990 by Bob Worsley Originally, it intended to ""get customers to order within 20 minutes of landing and have the goods waiting for them on arrival"", before it switched to home delivery. Same-day delivery required SkyMall to operate its own warehouses near select airports. Shortly after launching, the company purchased contracts from another company that allowed it to offer catalog merchandise to travelers flying U.S. air carriers. This move, which did not receive the support of all of the founders, required a significant shift in SkyMall's focus and operations, ultimately forcing the company to abandon same-day delivery and nearly bankrupting it. The company now offers goods from other companies' catalogs for drop-ship to the customer via third-party transport firms. The company drastically changed its business model around 1993. Instead of stocking the merchandise itself near airports, Skymall began leasing sections of the magazines to various distributors which customers would then order from directly. Smithsonian magazine has credited this decision with saving the company. Since 1999, SkyMall ownership has ""bounced around among several private-equity companies"", including by Najafi Companies, the largest private equity firm in Arizona in 2012. In 2009 SkyMall's website ""generated approximately $80.5 million in revenue"", making it the 185th largest e-commerce website by revenue. On May 17, 2013, SkyMall merged with Xhibit Corp, described as a new ""marketing software and digital advertising company that trades on an 'over-the-counter' exchange where equity shares of small companies can be bought and sold"". In less than two years, SkyMall, LLC and several affiliated companies, including its parent company Xhibit Corp., voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Arizona on January 22, 2015. On April 1, 2015, SkyMall was purchased out of bankruptcy court by C&A Marketing for $1.9 million; the new owners plan to re-launch the catalog with a new product selection that will partially downplay the brand's association with novelty items in favor of ""more of the innovative, fun, cool products that people are looking for, but that are still in keeping with the DNA of SkyMall."" Although SkyMall started as a conventional retailer, it was quickly realized that consumers weren't likely to buy them as they were to buy ""unconventional items"". One of the top-selling items upon the company filing for bankruptcy, for instance, was a Yeti statue. The Washington Post described the catalog's offerings as ""whimsical"".",Normal
"Christine Anne Milne AO (néeMorris; born 14 May 1953) is an Australian politician who served as a Senator for Tasmania. She was the leader of the parliamentary caucus of the Australian Greens from 2012 to 2015. Milne stepped down as leader on 6 May 2015, replaced by Richard Di Natale. Milne was born in Latrobe, Tasmania, the second daughter of Wesley Vale dairy farmers Tom and June Morris. She attended Wesley Vale Area School from 1959 to 1963, St Mary's College, Hobart as a boarder from 1964 to 1969, and completed her final year of schooling at Devonport High School in 1970. She studied history and political science at the University of Tasmania from 1971 to 1974, where she resided at Ena Waite University College and was elected its President. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree with Honours in Australian History, and a Certificate of Education in March 1975. From 1975 to 1984 Milne worked as a secondary school teacher, teaching English, History and Social Science at Parklands High School, Devonport High School and Don College. She first came to public attention for her role in opposing the building of the Wesley Vale pulp mill near Bass Strait in North Western Tasmania on the basis of its environmental impact. She also participated in the ultimately successful campaign opposing the Franklin Dam and was arrested and jailed in 1983. She worked as a research officer with the Australian Bicentennial Historical Records Search from 1987 to 1988. Milne was first elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly in 1989 as a member of the Tasmanian Greens in the electorate of Lyons, one of five Green politicians elected at that election. She was part of the Labor–Green Accord, a political agreement between the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Tasmanian Greens to form government after the 1989 general election had resulted in a hung parliament. When Bob Brown stood down in 1993 to contest the federal election, she became leader of the Greens in the Tasmanian Parliament and the first female leader of a political party in Tasmania. She oversaw a loose alliance between the Greens and Labor after the 1996 general election. During that time, Tasmania saw significant economic and social reform. Measures included gun law reform, liberalisation of gay laws, an apology to the Indigenous stolen generation and support for an Australian republic. In 1998, the major parties voted to restructure the House of Assembly from 35 to 25 seats, increasing the quota of votes required to be elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly. Liberal Premier Tony Rundle immediately called an election, which his party subsequently lost. Due to the changes, Milne lost her seat, leaving the Greens with one remaining seat. After her career in state politics, Milne was an adviser to Senator Bob Brown from 2000 until she was elected to represent Tasmania in the Federal Senate at the 2004 federal election. Preferences to Family First from the Australian Labor Party almost prevented her from being elected; however, she managed to reach a quota mostly as a result of the high level of below-the-line voting in Tasmania. The other Green elected at that election was Rachel Siewert from Western Australia. Milne was part of Bob Brown's frontbench covering the portfolios of Arts, Climate change, Competition Policy & Small Business, Finance & Administration, Food Security, Regional Australia, Resources & Energy, and Trade. Milne was Vice-President of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, also known as the World Conservation Union) from 2005 to 2008. She became Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens on 10 November 2008. In 2009, Milne debated the shortcomings of Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority Bill 2009 in the federal parliament. On 13 April 2012, Milne became the leader of the Australian Greens after the resignation of Bob Brown. She reorganised the Green's front bench. On 6 May 2015, Milne announced her immediate resignation from the leadership of the Australian Greens, and foreshadowed her departure from the Senate. Milne resigned from the Senate on 10 August 2015.",Normal

"Ishibashi Hajime (石橋甫, Ishibashi Hajime, July 28, 1862 – January 11, 1942) was a Japanese Vice-Admiral of the First Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. He primarily commanded the Matsushima, Takasago, and the America Maru throughout both wars and was the Chief Navigator of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Hajime was born on July 28, 1862, at Kanazawa, Kaga Province as the son of Ishibashi Ryōzō, an accountant of the Kaga Domain. From 19 July 1879, he attended the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy as part of its 10th class. His first role was aboard the Ryūjō on 13 September 1882. On 15 October 1883, he graduated from the Academy as a cadet. He was then assigned to Fusō on 18 February 1884, and was made an ensign on 7 April 1885. From 16 January 1886, he served as a squad leader on the Takachiho and a navigator of the Naniwa, and was promoted to Sub-Lieutenant on 7 April 1986. As he showed an exceptional talent in surveying and navigation, Ishibashi was assigned to the Hydrographic Department on 4 March 1887. His navigational role continued as he served as the chief navigation officer aboard the Seiki starting 12 September 1888, on the Fujiyama from 24 January 1889, and as the Chief Navigation Officer of Tateyama on 15 May 1889. He was then promoted to Lieutenant on August 28 and was assigned to the Naval Academy as an instructor on 22 March 1890. He became the official Navigation Instructor on 20 October 1890. While retaining the instructor position, he was appointed as the chief navigation officer of the Tenryū on 12 September 1890. Ishibashi then became the chief navigation officer of the Kongō on 30 May 1892, and the Matsushima on 24 November 1893. Additional responsibility on the cruiser was given as a squad leader on 27 August 1895. After the Imperial Japanese Navy captured the Zhenyuan during the First Sino-Japanese War, Ishibashi became the chief navigator of the ship on 18 February 1897. He was assigned to the Receiving Commission of the Takasago on 23 June 1897 and was sent to the United Kingdom, and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on 1 December 1897. He navigated the newly built cruiser and returned to Japan on 14 August 1898. He was promoted to Commander on 1 October and was assigned to the chief navigation officer of the Fuji as of the same date. At the same time, he held the responsibility as the chief navigator of the Standing Fleet from 19 December 1898 to 6 July 1899 and also as the chief navigation officer of the Yashima from June 19, 1899 until 28 September 1899. On 29 September 1899, he was made adjutant of the Sasebo Naval District and was assigned to the Military Division of the Ministry of the Navy as of 11 December 1899. On 19 May 1900, Ishibashi was transferred to the Personnel Division of the ministry and became the Executive Officer of the Hatsuse on 22 April 1902. He became the captain of the Atago on 1 November 1902, captain of the Takao on 22 June 1903, and Acting Commander of the cruiser Takasago on 7 July 1903, and was promoted to the rank of Captain and the ship commander on 17 January 1904. After the ship was sunk by a naval mine on 12 December 1904, he was assigned to the Kure Naval District. Ishibashi was then given command of the Amerika Maru on 12 January 1905. After the Battle of Tsushima in May, he was the ship commander of Anegawa Maru (ex-Russian hospital ship Orel), and later on 21 November 1905, became the commander of the cruiser Hashidate. He then commanded cruiser Azuma starting on 30 August 1906. Further commands included the Iwami (ex-Russian battleship Oryol) from 15 May 1908, the battleship Fuji from 25 January to 1 April 1909. He became the Director of the 2nd Division of the Imperial Japanese Navy Technical Department on 5 June 1909. He then became the Principal of the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology on 22 June 1910, and was promoted to Rear-Admiral on 16 July. Again promoted to Vice Admiral on 1 December 1914, Ishibashi was placed on the reserve list due to his age. He was placed on the backup list on 2 July 1917 and his final role was the President of Tokyo Nautical College from 10 March 1923, before retiring on July 2 of the same year.",Normal

The first explorers of the territory were the Portuguese bandeirantes in search of gold and precious stones. At the beginning of the 19th century, farmers from other municipalities settled there and developed agriculture. The city originated from the village formed around the Gado Bravo farm, owned by the Soares family. With the arrival of the tracks of the Eastern Brazilian Federal Railway Network in the 1940s, the town of Gado Bravo was formed.

"In computer science, hygienic macros are macros whose expansion is guaranteed not to cause the accidental capture of identifiers. They are a feature of programming languages such as Scheme, Dylan, Rust, Nim, and Julia. The general problem of accidental capture was well known in the Lisp community before the introduction of hygienic macros. Macro writers would use language features that would generate unique identifiers (e.g., gensym) or use obfuscated identifiers to avoid the problem. Hygienic macros are a programmatic solution to the capture problem that is integrated into the macro expander. The term ""hygiene"" was coined in Kohlbecker et al.'s 1986 paper that introduced hygienic macro expansion, inspired by terminology used in mathematics. In programming languages that have non-hygienic macro systems, it is possible for existing variable bindings to be hidden from a macro by variable bindings that are created during its expansion. In C, this problem can be illustrated by the following fragment: Running the above through the C preprocessor produces: The variable a declared in the top scope is shadowed by the a variable in the macro, which introduces a new scope. As a result, a is never altered by the execution of the program, as the output of the compiled program shows: The hygiene problem can extend beyond variable bindings. Consider this Common Lisp macro: While there are no references to variables in this macro, it assumes the symbols ""if"", ""not"", and ""progn"" are all bound to their usual definitions in the standard library. If, however the above macro is used in the following code: The definition of ""not"" has been locally altered and so the expansion of my-unless changes. Of course, the problem can occur for program-defined functions in a similar way: The use site redefines user-defined-operator and hence changes the behavior of the macro. The hygiene problem can be resolved with conventional macros using several alternative solutions. The simplest solution, if temporary storage is needed during macro expansion, is to use unusual variables names in the macro in hope that the same names will never be used by the rest of the program. Until a variable named INCIa is created, this solution produces the correct output: The problem is solved for the current program, but this solution is not robust. The variables used inside the macro and those in the rest of the program have to be kept in sync by the programmer. Specifically, using the macro INCI on a variable INCIa is going to fail in the same way that the original macro failed on a variable a. In some programming languages, it is possible for a new variable name, or symbol, to be generated and bound to a temporary location. The language processing system ensures that this never clashes with another name or location in the execution environment. The responsibility for choosing to use this feature within the body of a macro definition is left to the programmer. This method was used in MacLisp, where a function named gensym could be used to generate a new symbol name. Similar functions (usually named gensym as well) exist in many Lisp-like languages, including the widely implemented Common Lisp standard and Elisp. Although symbol creation solves the variable shadowing issue, it does not directly solve the issue of function redefinition. However, gensym, macro facilities, and standard library functions are sufficient to embed hygienic macros in an unhygienic language. This is similar to obfuscation in that a single name is shared by multiple expansions of the same macro. Unlike an unusual name, however, a read time uninterned symbol is used (denoted by the #: notation), for which it is impossible to occur outside of the macro, similar to gensym. Using packages such as in Common Lisp, the macro simply uses a private symbol from the package in which the macro is defined. The symbol will not accidentally occur in user code. User code would have to reach inside the package using the double colon (::) notation to give itself permission to use the private symbol, for instance cool-macros::secret-sym. At that point, the issue of accidental lack of hygiene is moot. Furthermore the ANSI Common Lisp standard categorizes redefining standard functions and operators, globally or locally, as invoking undefined behavior. Such usage can be thus diagnosed by the implementation as erroneous. Thus the Lisp package system provide a viable, complete solution to the macro hygiene problem, which can be regarded as an instance of name clashing. For example, in the program-defined function redefinition example, the my-unless macro can reside in its own package, where user-defined-operator is a private symbol in that package. The symbol user-defined-operator occurring in the user code will then be a different symbol, unrelated to the one used in the definition of the my-unless macro. In some languages the expansion of a macro does not need to correspond to textual code; rather than expanding to an expression containing the symbol f, a macro may produce an expansion containing the actual object referred to by f. Similarly if the macro needs to use local variables or objects defined in the macro's package, it can expand to an invocation of a closure object whose enclosing lexical environment is that of the macro definition. Hygienic macro systems in languages such as Scheme use a macro expansion process that preserves the lexical scoping of all identifiers and prevents accidental capture. This property is called referential transparency. In cases where capture is desired, some systems allow the programmer to explicitly violate the hygiene mechanisms of the macro system. For example, Scheme's let-syntax and define-syntax macro creation systems are hygienic, so the following Scheme implementation of my-unless will have the desired behavior: The hygienic macro processor responsible for transforming the patterns of the input form into an output form detects symbol clashes and resolves them by temporarily changing the names of symbols. The basic strategy is to identify bindings in the macro definition and replace those names with gensyms, and to identify free variables in the macro definition and make sure those names are looked up in the scope of the macro definition instead of the scope where the macro was used. Macro systems that automatically enforce hygiene originated with Scheme. The original KFFD algorithm for a hygienic macro system was presented by Kohlbecker in '86. At the time, no standard macro system was adopted by Scheme implementations. Shortly thereafter in '87, Kohlbecker and Wand proposed a declarative pattern-based language for writing macros, which was the predecessor to the syntax-rules macro facility adopted by the R5RS standard. Syntactic closures, an alternative hygiene mechanism, was proposed as an alternative to Kohlbecker et al.'s system by Bawden and Rees in '88. Unlike the KFFD algorithm, syntactic closures require the programmer to explicitly specify the resolution of the scope of an identifier. In 1993, Dybvig et al. introduced the syntax-case macro system, which uses an alternative representation of syntax and maintains hygiene automatically. The syntax-case system can express the syntax-rules pattern language as a derived macro. The term macro system can be ambiguous because, in the context of Scheme, it can refer to both a pattern-matching construct (e.g., syntax-rules) and a framework for representing and manipulating syntax (e.g., syntax-case, syntactic closures). Syntax-rules is a high-level pattern matching facility that attempts to make macros easier to write. However, syntax-rules is not able to succinctly describe certain classes of macros and is insufficient to express other macro systems. Syntax-rules was described in the R4RS document in an appendix but not mandated. Later, R5RS adopted it as a standard macro facility. Here is an example syntax-rules macro that swaps the value of two variables: Due to the deficiencies of a purely syntax-rules based macro system, the R6RS Scheme standard adopted the syntax-case macro system. Unlike syntax-rules, syntax-case contains both a pattern matching language and a low-level facility for writing macros. The former allows macros to be written declaratively, while the latter allows the implementation of alternative frontends for writing macros. The swap example from before is nearly identical in syntax-case because the pattern matching language is similar: However, syntax-case is more powerful than syntax-rules. For example, syntax-case macros can specify side-conditions on its pattern matching rules via arbitrary Scheme functions. Alternatively, a macro writer can choose not to use the pattern matching frontend and manipulate the syntax directly. Using the datum->syntax function, syntax-case macros can also intentionally capture identifiers, thus breaking hygiene. Other macro systems have also been proposed and implemented for Scheme. Syntactic closures and explicit renaming are two alternative macro systems. Both systems are lower-level than syntax-rules and leave the enforcement of hygiene to the macro writer. This differs from both syntax-rules and syntax-case, which automatically enforce hygiene by default. The swap examples from above are shown here using a syntactic closure and explicit renaming implementation respectively: Hygienic macros offer safety and referential transparency at the expense of making intentional variable capture less straight-forward. Doug Hoyte, author of Let Over Lambda, writes: Almost all approaches taken to reducing the impact of variable capture serve only to reduce what you can do with defmacro. Hygienic macros are, in the best of situations, a beginner's safety guard-rail; in the worst of situations they form an electric fence, trapping their victims in a sanitised, capture-safe prison. Many hygienic macro systems do offer escape hatches without compromising on the guarantees that hygiene provides; for instance, Racket allows you to define syntax parameters, which allow you to selectively introduce bound variables. Gregg Henderschott gives an example at Fear of Macros of implementing an anaphoric if operator in this way.",Normal

"Szrogh György (January 23, 1915 – 29 November 1999) was a Hungarian architect and professor. He graduated in 1938 from Royal Jozsef Nador Technical University. After finished his studies, he worked in several places, such as the Louis Hidas studio, MÉMOSZ Construction Company, City Building Research Institute (VATI) and Residential Building Design Bureau (LAKÓTERV). He had participated in the UNESCO foreign exchange program between 1966 and 1967. At that time he was in England, Mexico and United States of America, when he learned new principles and methods of design. From 1966 he was professor at the Hungarian College of Applied Arts and led the Department of Architecture from 1966 to 1984. Regarding his way of design, Szrogh György began in the spirit of neoclassicism, but soon his approach became near the modernism of Bauhaus, and his focus turned to functional and technological aspects. His buildings were characterized by well-organized and clean designs. Some important works are: Mémosz Headquarters (which were a team work inside MÉMOSZ Construction Company and is famous as one of the latest modernist buildings in Budapest); the main building of the Konkoly Observatory’s Piszkéstető Station; the dome of the 6090cm Schmidt Telescope in the early 1960s; and the Hotel Budapest (1967) at the Buda hillside, which is a symbol of the late 1960s architecture in Hungary.",Normal

"Farnborough North railway station is a railway station in the town of Farnborough in Hampshire, England. The station is managed by Great Western Railway, who operate services on the North Downs Line from Reading to Guildford, Redhill and Gatwick Airport. It is one of two stations in Farnborough; the other, Farnborough (Main), is situated on the South West Main Line and is considerably busier. The Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway (RG&RR) was authorised in 1846 and opened in stages. One of the first two sections to open was between Reading and Farnborough, on 4 July 1849. Originally named Farnborough, the station was renamed Farnborough North on 9 July 1923. On 17 April 1860, the bare-knuckle world championship between Tom Sayers, champion of England, and John C. Heenan, champion of the USA, took place in a field just East of the station. The fighters and vast crowd had arrived by train from London. At the station, there is a self-service ticket machine, a very small car park and disabled access to the platform. There is, however, no staffed ticket office and no waiting room. All services at Farnborough North are operated by Great Western Railway using Class 165 and 166 DMUs. The typical off-peak service is one train per hour in each direction between Reading and Gatwick Airport via Guildford. During the peak hours, the service is increased to two trains per hour in each direction. On Sundays, eastbound services at the station run only as far as Redhill.",Normal
"Jorhat (pron: ˈʤɔ:(r)ˌhɑ:t) is an administrative district of the Indian state of Assam situated in the central part of the Brahmaputra Valley. The district is bounded by Majuli on north, Nagaland state on the south, Sivasagar on the east and Golaghat on the west. On the north of the district, the river Brahmaputra forms the largest riverine island of the world. The administrative seat is at Jorhat city. Jorhat was previously a sub-division of undivided Sibsagar district. In 1983, Jorhat was carved out of Sibsagar District and was made a separate district. Jorhat (যোৰহাট) or Jorehaut means tween hats (Bazar) or mandis - Macharhat (মাছৰহাট) and Chowkihat (চকীহাট) which existed on the two different banks of the river Bhogdoi during the 18th century. The northernmost area of the present district was a part of the Chutiya Kingdom before the Ahom-Chutiya war in the 16th century. In 1794 the Ahom king Gaurinath Singha shifted the capital from Sibsagar (erstwhile ""Rangpur"") to Jorhat. This town was a flourishing and commercial metropolis but completely destroyed after a series of the Burmese invasions since 1817 till the arrival of the British force in 1824 under the Stewardship of David Scott and Captain Richard. The British rule, though, was not free from rebellions and revolutions, contributed to reemergence of this historical town. From the very first decade of the British rule, the great revolutionists who emerged were Gomdhar Konwar, Jeuram and Piyali, British system of administration, came into vogue in 1839 with an established Police Thana. During the great Sepoy Mutiny, the anti-British plot hatched by Maniram Dewan and Piyali Barua, was sabotaged. These leaders were hanged in public at this very place in 1858. In 1885, a narrow-gauge train service (Jorehaut Provincial Railway) came into operation and ultimately became instrumental in the rapid growth of the tea industry. Though the civil sub-division under Sibsagar district at Jorhat was formed in 1869, this place was declared as administration headquarters of the undivided Sibsagar district in 1911, which comprised the present Sibsagar, Jorhat and Golaghat and parts of Karbi-Anglong district with Major A. Playfair as the first deputy commissioner. The modern-day district of Jorhat was created in 1983 when it was split from Sibsagar district. On the north of the district, the river Brahmaputra forms the largest riverine island of the world, Majuli, spreading over 924.6km2. with a population of about 1.50 lakh being threatened by the constant erosion by this mighty, unstable river. Majuli had been the principal place of pilgrimage of Vaishnavites since the ages of the Ahom rules. There are several Satras resembling medieval monasteries headed by Satradhikars preaching and teaching the Vaishnavism which was initiated by Sankardeva (1449–1568). Each Satra has unknown wealth of Vaishnav scriptures and extensive revenue free lands being cultivated by the ""Bhakats"" of the Satras. Jorhat district occupies an area of 2,851 square kilometres (1,101sqmi), comparatively equivalent to Russia's Zemlya Georga. Floods frequent the island every year without exception. The mean annual rainfall of the district is 2029mm. The District Administration is headed by Deputy Commissioner Ashok Kumar Barman, IAS. is the Superintendent of Police of Jorhat district and belongs to the IPS batch of 2011 (Assam-Meghalaya cadre). The only outlying civil subdivision is Titabor . Titabor subdivisional administration is headed by SDO (Civil) Ayush Garg, IAS. There are five Assam Legislative Assembly constituencies in this district: Jorhat, Teok, Mariani, Titabor and Dergaon. Dergaon is designated for scheduled castes. Dergaon is in the Kaliabor Lok Sabha constituency. The other four are in the Jorhat Lok Sabha constituency. There are about 135 tea gardens, including out gardens, and the predominant field crop is rice, with per capita food grain production of 205kg per annum. The district has a number of small-scale and cottage industries in the field of cane work and bamboo work, silver jewellery, furniture making, brass smithing, umbrella making, soap manufacturing, packaged food manufacturing etc. Type of industries present in Jorhat are agro based, cotton textile, woolen, silk & artificial thread based clothes, ready-made garments & embroidery, woodwooden based furniture, chemicalchemical based, rubber, plastic & petro based, metal based (steel fab.), repairing & servicing, etc. Jorhat facilitates as the base location to reach out to many interesting places of international importance located at close proximity such as Majuli, Kaziranga National Park, Sivasagar, Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary, the famous Molai forest, forested single handed, Dhekiakhowa Bornamghar, etc. Examples of numerous attractions that can be visited within the district are Lachit Borphukan's Maidam, Raja Maidam, Jorhat Science Centre & Planetarium, Jorhat Gymkhana Club, Chandrakanta Handique Bhavan, Jorhat District Museum, Thengal Manor, Sukapha Samannay Kshetra, Kaziranga Golf Resort, Shanti Ashram, Jagannath Temple, Thengal Cultural Centre & Museum, public parks, multiple tea gardens, Sukapha Park, Gabhoru Parbat and many more. According to the 2011 census Jorhat district has a population of 1,092,256, roughly equal to the nation of Cyprus or the US state of Rhode Island. This gives it a ranking of 418th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of 383 inhabitants per square kilometre (990sqmi) . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 9.21%. Jorhat has a sex ratio of 956 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 83.42%. The divided district has a population of 924,952, of which 220,534 (23.84%) live in urban areas. Jorhat has a sex ratio of 963 females per 1000 males. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are 64,787 (7.00%) and 62,368 (6.74%) of the population respectively. Main Assamese communities in the district are Tea tribes (Adivasi), Ahom, Chutia, Sonowal Kacharis, Thengal Kachari. Hindus are 842,520 (91.09%) of the population. Muslims are 54,092 (5.85%) and Christians are 20,796 (2.25%) of the population. Languages of Jorhat district (2011) At the time of the 2011 census, 88.65% of the population spoke Assamese, 3.77% Bengali, 3.04% Hindi and 1.63% Mising as their first language. A tourist from other parts of India should not face and issue in communicating in Hindi. Likewise, for an international tourist communication in English is well understood. The cultural diversities which prevailed in Jorhat nearly a century ago has inspired the people to participate in cultural activities through the decades and as a result Jorhat has been able to produce many creative writers, musician, actors, historians and journalists, terming Jorhat The Cultural Capital of Assam. Festivals Tea festivals The Tea Festival is held in the district of Jorhat in the northeastern state of Assam in India. Jorhat is well known for its extensive tea gardens, and is the nerve centre of the tea industry. Jorhat has the world famous Tocklai Experimental Centre. In this place research work is carried out to find new varieties of tea and also the curative effects of green tea. The island of Majuli, the largest island on the Brahmaputra, and the Nambar Forest Reserve can be visited from Jorhat. In Majuli there are numerous monasteries and the Nambar Forest Reserve is famous for being a regenerating hot spring. Description of Tea Festival The Tea Festival in Jorhat is all about tea, music and gaiety. The Tea Festival in Jorhat brings about a world of festivity with a warm and traditional cordial reception. The Jorhat Tea Festival offers an excellent package of fun and excitement. The celebrations of the Festival of Tea in Jorhat include visit to the tea gardens, playing golf, safaris into the jungles, tasting delicious food items, shopping and cultural entertainment. The adventure sports on offer include angling and rafting in turbulent rivers. The Tea Festival of Jorhat in Assam is a pleasant blend of a business trip and a pleasure trip. Along with the beauty and cultural diversity of Assam, tourists can also meet the warm hearted people of Assam. Time of Celebration of Tea Festival The Tea Festival in Jorhat, in the state of Assam, is celebrated every year with great enjoyment, fun and entertainment Majuli festivals The northeastern state of Assam in India is famous for Majuli, the largest river island in the world, earlier a part of the district administration of Jorhat. The island of Majuli is positioned in the middle of river Brahmaputra and is the abode to the place of Vaishnavite culture in Majuli. The total area of Majuli has been diminishing gradually due to strong erosion of the river Brahmaputra. The Majuli Festival provides lot of opportunities to fit oneself into the festival. During the Majuli Festival in Assam, special events like cultural programs and exhibitions are organized. Description of Majuli Festival The Assam Majuli Festival is held on the bank of river Luit, the location of which has an immeasurably beautiful and picturesque milieu. The river Luit is just 1.5 kilometers from the sub-divisional headquarter of Majuli Island, Garamur. The Festival of Majuli in Majuli in Assam conducts many cultural programs with the cultural troupes of Majuli as well as troupes from the rest of the country. In the exhibition, Assamese products are on display, which are specially prepared and designed by artistes that draw attention to the traditional grandeur of Majuli. The organizers also arrange for a food festival in the Majuli Festival in Assam, where Assamese and tribal dishes are also made obtainable. Seminars are also organized to have a discussion on different topics. A display of various artwork and culturally driven masks can be seen in different museums located in the island. Reaching the Majuli Festival of Majuli in Assam, one can observe the gathering and adjustment of all ethnic groups of people under the same sky, but at the same time the groups are keeping on their respective traditional and individual cultural entities. This is a very remarkable event. The island of Majuli has an environment of a bird sanctuary which attracts nonextant species of various migrant birds. Time of Celebration of Majuli Festival The Assam Majuli Festival is presumably held during the winter season, in the month of November. This arrangement is made keeping in mind the climate conditions and the road communicating facilities in Majuli. Jorhat has produced many creative writers, historians, journalists and many more. In 1997 Jorhat district became home to the Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary, which has an area of 21km2 (8.1sqmi), is a protected area which is home to hoolock gibbons. There is another forest called Mulai Kathoni or Molai Forest, a man-made forest covering 550 hectares of area on a Brahmaputra river sandbar located near Kokilamukh area. It is named after Jadav Payeng, Indian environmental activist and forestry worker. Molai forest and Payeng have been the subject of a number of documentaries. A locally made film documentary, produced by Jitu Kalita in 2012 The Molai Forest, was screened at the Jawaharlal Nehru University. Jitu Kalita, who lives near Payeng's house, has also featured and given recognition on his reporting of the life of Payeng through his documentary. Molai forest was also featured in a 2013 documentary Foresting life, directed by the Indian documentary filmmaker Aarti Shrivastava, and in William Douglas McMaster's 2013 film documentary Forest Man. People have pledged US$8,327 on the Kickstarter campaign for the post-production of this documentary in early 2013, which was shown at 2014 Cannes Film Festival. About 100km from Jorhat lies the internationally recognized Kaziranga National Park. Jorhat is considered one of the best locations for modern education in the state. The city of Jorhat has one of the highest number of educational institutions in the region. The literacy rate of the district of Jorhat is next to Kamrup Metropolitan. The Jorhat Government Boys School is the oldest school established in 1883 with special facilities for science teaching. The Jagannath Barooah College is the premier and oldest college in the district (set up in 1930) and said to be first college in Upper Assam. Multiple schools and colleges had come up later. The people of Jorhat can rightly be proud of being a part of its glorious heritage and culture. Some notable schools in the district are Balya Niketon Kakojan, Balya Bhavan, Don Bosco High School, Baghchung, Army Public School Jorhat, Air Force School, Carmel Convent School, Hemalata Handiqui Memorial Institute, Don Bosco High School Lichubari,Jyoti Vidyapith Teok , Assam Rifle's Public School, Delhi Public School, Spring Dale High School, Maharishi Vidya Mandir, St. Mary's High School, Ben Garden High School, Kendriya Vidyalaya NEIST, Kendriya Vidyalaya ONGC, Kendriya Vidyalaya Air Force Station, Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Jorhat, Jonaki Sangha Vidyalaya, Assam Valley English Medium School, Sankar Dev Vidya Niketan, Bahona Boys High School, Royal Oak High School, Pragjyotika Titabar, Jatiya Vidyalaya Titabar, St. Anthony's High School, Maan International High School, Mihiram Saikia Higher Secondary School, Sankardev Seminary School, Jorhat Govt.

School, Jorhat Model Composite School, Gitarthi Girls High School, DCB Girls High School, Dipankar Vidyapith, 4 No Ward Primary School, Rashtrabhasa School, Rebakanta Baruah School, Bidyadhar Saikia School etc. Jorhat is the seat of learning with the first agricultural university in the northeast region — Assam Agricultural University — established in 1969. Apart from that it has many prominent higher educational and research institutions. Those are - Jorhat Engineering College (1960), North East Institute of Science and Technology (NEIST) (1961), National Institute of Design, Jorhat (2019), Assam Women's University (2013), HRH The Prince of Wales Institute of Engineering and Technology (POWIET) (1926), Tocklai Tea Research Institute (1911), Rain Forest Research Institute (1988), Jorhat Medical College and Hospital (2009), Jorhat Institute of Science & Technology (JIST) and Kaziranga University (2012). Some other educational institutes of Jorhat districts are - CKB Commerce College, Jorhat College, Jorhat Law College, Dr.J.K.Saikia Homeopathic Medical College and Hospital, DCB Girls College, Bahona College, Jorhat Kendriya Mahavidyalaya, Kakojan College, Chandra Kamal Bezbaruah College, Nanda Nath Saikia College and Mariani College. The healthy education and cultural life of Jorhat can be best judged from the fact that the district has as many as five daily newspapers published from two publishing groups. The Janambhumi Group of Publications are the oldest media group of Jorhat. The Saptahik Janambhumi, the Dainik Janambhumi, and the Eastern Clarion are its sister newspapers. The Spatahik Janambhumi celebrated its 50 years of circulation and the Dainik Janambhumi crossed its 25 years of existence. The G.L. Publication publishes three newspapers from Guwahati and Jorhat simultaneously. They are the North East Times (English), Amar Asom (Assamese), and the Purbanchal Prohori (Hindi). The other newspapers published from Jorhat are Dainik Agradoot, Asomiya Khabar and The Telegraph. 26°45′00″N 94°13′00″E﻿ ﻿26.75°N 94.2167°E﻿ 26.75; 94.2167",Normal

"Isidoro Grünhut (27 August 1862, Trieste – 5 May 1896, Florence) was an Italian painter of Jewish ancestry; known for genre scenes and portraits. His father, Israel, was originally from Regensburg. His mother, Giuditta née Panzieri, was from an upper-class family in Ancona. He displayed artistic talent at an early age, but his father was opposed to his pursuit of that as a career. At the age of sixteen, he rebelled, running away from home to join up with an ""impresario"" named Benelli; providing drawings in return for his upkeep. The constant travelling, long hours and poor food undermined his already precarious health; having suffered a childhood fall that damaged his back. He eventually developed a chronic heart condition, and was forced to quit. Around 1880, after a brief stay in Trieste, he was able to enroll at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia, where he studied with Pompeo Marino Molmenti. After two years, he transferred to the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. There, he met two other students from Trieste; Carlo Wostry and Umberto Veruda, whose recollections provide much of what is known about him up to this period. In 1884, new health problems forced him to quit attending school and work as an itinerant portrait painter. He left Munich in 1886 and returned to Trieste. In 1888, he participated in a competition in Bologna, but was denied a prize because he lacked Italian citizenship; Trieste being part of Austria-Hungary at that time. He was also rejected for a scholarship that would have allowed him to study in Rome, but was able to gain financial support from Baron Giuseppe Morpurgo (1816-1898), head curator at the Museo Revoltella. While in Rome, he was able to attract a permanent patron, Count Alessandro Lotteringhi della Stufa, who offered him room to set up a studio at the family palace in Florence. There, he gained numerous clients among the aristocracy, but much of his work from that time is unknown, as it remains in private collections. He left there in 1891, to travel, although he went back occasionally, and returned in 1893. During this period, he painted little, focusing on caricatures, and lived a very disorganized life. He also contracted an unhappy marriage, with Irene Fabbricotti, a young woman from Tuscany, who gave him two daughters. Count Lotteringhi died in 1895, and his heirs took away the studio. Left without that resource, Grünhut's livelihood was precarious and he became more unruly. His excesses led to a physical and mental collapse; leaving him paralyzed and leading to his death; aged only thirty-three. Media related to Isidoro Grünhut at Wikimedia Commons",Normal
"The International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is one of the three Sectors (branches) of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). It is responsible for coordinating standards for telecommunications and Information Communication Technology, such as X.509 for cybersecurity, Y.3172 and Y.3173 for machine learning, and H.264MPEG-4 AVC for video compression, between its Member States, Private Sector Members, and Academia Members. The World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA), the sector's governing conference, convenes every four years. ITU-T has a permanent secretariat called the Telecommunication Standardization Bureau (TSB), which is based at the ITU headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The current director of the TSB is Seizo Onoe (of Japan), whose 4-year term commenced on 1 January 2023. Seizo Onoe succeeded Chaesub Lee of South Korea, who was director from 1 January 2015 until 31 December 2022. The ITU-T mission is to ensure the efficient and timely production of standards covering all fields of telecommunications and Information Communication Technology (ICTs) on a worldwide basis, as well as defining tariff and accounting principles for international telecommunication services. The international standards that are produced by the ITU-T are referred to as ""Recommendations"" (with the word capitalized to distinguish its meaning from the common parlance sense of the word ""recommendation""), as they become mandatory only when adopted as part of a national law. Since the ITU-T is part of the ITU, which is a United Nations specialized agency, its standards carry more formal international weight than those of most other standards development organizations that publish technical specifications of a similar form. At the initiative of Napoleon III, the French government invited international participants to a conference in Paris in 1865 to facilitate and regulate international telegraph services. A result of the conference was the founding of the forerunner of the modern ITU. At the 1925 Paris conference, the ITU created two consultative committees to deal with the complexities of the international telephone services, known as CCIF (as the French acronym) and with long-distance telegraphy CCIT (Comité Consultatif International des Communications Téléphoniques a grande distance). In view of the basic similarity of many of the technical problems faced by the CCIF and CCIT, a decision was taken in 1956 to merge them into a single entity, the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT, in French: Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique). The first Plenary Assembly of the new organization was held in Geneva, Switzerland in December 1956. In 1992, the Plenipotentiary Conference (the top policy-making conference of ITU) saw a reform of ITU, giving the Union greater flexibility to adapt to an increasingly complex, interactive and competitive environment. The CCITT was renamed the Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T), as one of three Sectors of the Union alongside the Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) and the Telecommunication Development Sector (ITU-D). Historically, the Recommendations of the CCITT were presented at plenary assemblies for endorsement, held every four years, and the full set of Recommendations were published after each plenary assembly. However, the delays in producing texts, and translating them into other working languages, did not suit the fast pace of change in the telecommunications industry. The rise of the personal computer industry in the early 1980s created a new common practice among both consumers and businesses of adopting ""bleeding edge"" communications technology even if it was not yet standardized. Thus, standards organizations had to put forth standards much faster, or find themselves ratifying de facto standards after the fact. One of the most prominent examples of this was the Open Document Architecture project, which began in 1985 when a profusion of software firms around the world were still furiously competing to shape the future of the electronic office, and was completed in 1999 long after Microsoft Office's then-secret binary file formats had become established as the global de facto standard. The ITU-T now operates under much more streamlined processes. The time between an initial proposal of a draft document by a member company and the final approval of a full-status ITU-T Recommendation can now be as short as a few months (or less in some cases). This makes the standardization approval process in the ITU-T much more responsive to the needs of rapid technology development than in the ITU's historical past. New and updated Recommendations are published on an almost daily basis, and nearly all of the library of over 3,270 Recommendations is now free of charge online. (About 30 specifications jointly maintained by the ITU-T and ISOIEC are not available for free to the public.) ITU-T has moreover tried to facilitate cooperation between the various forums and standard-developing organizations (SDOs). This collaboration is necessary to avoid duplication of work and the consequent risk of conflicting standards in the market place. In the work of standardization, ITU-T cooperates with other SDOs, e.g., the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Most of the work of ITU-T is carried out by its Sector Members and Associates, while the Telecommunication Standardization Bureau (TSB) is the executive arm of ITU-T and coordinator for a number of workshops and seminars to progress existing work areas and explore new ones. The events cover a wide array of topics in the field of information and communication technologies (ICT) and attract high-ranking experts as speakers, and attendees from engineers to high-level management from all industry sectors. The technical work, the development of Recommendations, of ITU-T is managed by Study Groups (SGs), such as Study Group 13 for network standards, Study Group 16 for multimedia standards, and Study Group 17 for security standards, which are created by the World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA) which is held every four years. As part of the deliberations, WTSA has instructed ITU to hold the Global Standards Symposium, which unlike WTSA is open to public for participation. The people involved in these SGs are experts in telecommunications from all over the world. There are currently 11 SGs. Study groups meet face to face (or virtually under exceptional circumstances) according to a calendar issued by the TSB. SGs are augmented by Focus Groups (FGs), an instrument created by ITU-T, providing a way to quickly react to ICT standardization needs and allowing great flexibility in terms of participation and working methods. The key difference between SGs and FGs is that the latter have greater freedom to organize and finance themselves, and to involve non-members in their work, but they do not have the authority to approve Recommendations. Focus Groups can be created very quickly, are usually short-lived and can choose their own working methods, leadership, financing, and types of deliverables. Current Focus Groups include the ITU-WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H) as well as Machine Learning for 5G (which developed Y.3172), Quantum Information Technologies for Networks, and Artificial Intelligence for Assisted and Autonomous Driving. The Alternative Approval Process (AAP) is a fast-track approval procedure that was developed to allow standards to be brought to market in the timeframe that industry now demands. The AAP is defined in ITU-T Recommendation A.8. This dramatic overhaul of standards-making by streamlining approval procedures was implemented in 2001 and is estimated to have cut the time involved in this critical aspect of the standardization process by 80 to 90 percent. This means that an average standard that took around four years to approve and publish until the mid nineties, and two years until 1997, can now be approved in an average of two months, or as little as five weeks. Besides streamlining the underlying procedures involved in the approval process, an important contributory factor to the use of AAP is electronic document handling. Once the approval process has begun the rest of the process can be completed electronically, in the vast majority of cases, with no further physical meetings. The introduction of AAP also formalizes publicprivate partnership in the approval process by providing equal opportunities for both sector members and member states in the approval of technical standards. A panel of SG experts drafts a proposal that is then forwarded at an SG meeting to the appropriate body which decides if it is sufficiently ready to be designated a draft text and thus gives its consent for further review at the next level. After this Consent has been given, TSB announces the start of the AAP procedure by posting the draft text to the ITU-T website and calling for comments. This gives the opportunity for all members to review the text. This phase, called last call, is a four-week period in which comments can be submitted by member states and sector members. If no comments other than editorial corrections are received, the Recommendation is considered approved since no issues were identified that might need any further work. However, if there are any comments, the SG chairman, in consultation with TSB, sets up a comment resolution process by the concerned experts. The revised text is then posted on the web for an additional review period of three weeks. Similar to the last call phase, in additional review the Recommendation is considered as approved if no comments are received. If comments are received, it is apparent that there are some issues that still need more work, and the draft text and all comments are sent to the next Study Group meeting for further discussion and possible approval. Those Recommendations considered as having policy or regulatory implications are approved through what is known as the Traditional Approval Process (TAP), which allows a longer period for reflection and commenting by member states. TAP Recommendations are also translated into the six working languages of ITU (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish). ITU-T Recommendations are the names given to telecommunications and computer protocol specification documents published by ITU-T. ITU-T assigns each Recommendation a name based on the series and Recommendation number. The name starts with the letter of the series the Recommendation belongs to. Each series encompasses a broad category of Recommendations, such as ""H-Series Recommendations: Audiovisual and multimedia systems"". The series letter is followed by a period and the Recommendation number, which uniquely identifies the Recommendation within the series. Often, a range of related Recommendations are further grouped within the series and given adjacent numbers, such as ""H.200-H.499: Infrastructure of audiovisual services"" or ""H.260-H.279: Coding of moving video"". Many numbers are ""skipped"" to give room for future Recommendations to be adjacent to related Recommendations. Recommendations can be revised or ""superseded"" and keep their existing Recommendation number. In addition to the ITU-T Recommendations, which have non-mandatory status unless they are adopted in national laws, ITU-T is also the custodian of a binding international treaty, the International Telecommunication Regulations. The ITRs go back to the earliest days of the ITU when there were two separate treaties, dealing with telegraph and telephone. The ITRs were adopted, as a single treaty, at the World Administrative Telegraphy and Telephone Conference held in Melbourne, 1988 (WATTC-88). The ITRs comprise ten articles which deal, inter alia, with the definition of international telecommunication services, cooperation between countries and national administrations, safety of life and priority of telecommunications and charging and accounting principles. The adoption of the ITRs in 1988 is often taken as the start of the wider liberalization process in international telecommunications, though a few countries, including United States and United Kingdom, had made steps to liberalize their markets before 1988. The Constitution and Convention of ITU provides for the amendment of ITRs through a World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT). Accordingly, in 1998 there began a process of review of the ITRs; and in 2009 extensive preparations began for such a conference, WCIT-12. In addition to ""regional preparatory meetings"", the ITU Secretariat developed 13 ""Background Briefs on key issues"" that were expected to be discussed at the conference. Convened by former ITU secretary-general Hamadoun Touré, the Conference, WCIT-12, was then held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, during the period 3–14 December 2014. The Standardization Sector of ITU also organizes AI for Good, the United Nations platform for the sustainable development of Artificial Intelligence.",Normal

"Westtown School is a Quaker, coeducational, college preparatory day and boarding school for students in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade, located in West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States, 20 miles west of Philadelphia. Founded in 1799 by the Religious Society of Friends. Westtown is a Quaker school affiliated with the Friends General Conference branch of the Religious Society of Friends. The school requires all students to attend Meeting for Worship together with adults in the community who voluntarily attend (boarding students must attend Westtown Monthly Meeting on Sundays as well). Westtown uses the traditional Quaker practice of coming to unity in making some high-level decisions. Westtown has been coeducational since its 1799 founding. Westtown students come from 16 states and 13 countries. Westtown School opened on May 6, 1799. Philadelphia Quakers founded the school after raising money to build a boarding school and purchasing land a full day's carriage ride from Philadelphia—where they could provide a ""guarded education in a healthy environment"" away from the secular influences of the city. For many years, Westtown was nearly self-sufficient, with the campus providing raw materials used in the construction of its buildings and food for the people who lived and worked at the school. Westtown is the oldest continuously operating co-educational boarding school in the United States. Boys and girls had separate classes until about 1870. Boys learned useful skills such as woodshop, surveying, and bookkeeping, and girls had classes like sewing. However, Westtown eventually recognized that students of both genders should know basic academic subjects such as reading, penmanship, grammar, mathematics, geography, and science. The 1880s brought physical changes to Westtown. The main building was replaced with a structure designed by architect Addison Hutton, completed in 1888, and still in use today. During the 20th century, the student body and curriculum became more diverse. For example, the school added visual and performing arts, and non-Quakers, African-American, and international students were eventually admitted. Westtown's Esther Duke Archives is a facility dedicated to collecting and maintaining materials relating to the people and history of the school. The 2018 documentary, We Town, is about the 2016-2017 Upper School Basketball Team, featuring Mo Bamba and Cam Reddish. It chronicles the quest of the team to win the State Championship. Westtown is located on a campus in southern Pennsylvania. The campus is 600 acres, including a 14.5-acre lake, arboretum, frog pond, 14 playing fields, stadium tennis courts, organic farm, Lower School mini-farm, medicine wheel garden, wooded cross country course, and 21-element ropes course. 39°56′58″N 75°32′16″W﻿ ﻿39.9494°N 75.5379°W﻿ 39.9494; -75.5379",Normal

"Teresa Meana Suárez (Gijón, 1952) is a Spanish feminist activist, teacher, and philologist specializing in inclusive and non-sexist language. She has published numerous articles on the issue of language discrimination against women, specifically, in Spanish. Meana has a degree in Romance Philology and has always worked as a Spanish language teacher in secondary education in Oviedo and Valencia, where she has lived for 25 years. She has been a member of the feminist movement since 1975. She met clandestinely with her colleagues at the university and attended student assemblies. They read the prohibited texts and soon organized themselves to organize conferences, debates, and talks that would flesh out those ideas that they defended with their heads and their own bodies. Since the 1980s, she has dedicated herself especially to addressing the issue of sexism in language, a specialty on which she has given numerous lectures and workshops throughout Spain. For six years, she was in Latin America, where she specialized in the characteristics of Spanish language on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. In Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, she published an instruction book on a non-sexist use of the language and taught a course on the same subject in a university in the Dominican capital. She traveled with other women through Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, always received, helped, and housed by feminists from those countries. She is a noted linguist in the academic field for her critical and purposeful analysis of the androcentric opacity of social discourse. She has published various articles on issues related to the invisibility of women in language. In 2002, she published a manual on a non-sexist use of language, entitled Porque las palabras no se las lleva el viento (Because the words are not carried away by the wind). In 2016, she attended the 2016 Feminist Debate Conference in Montevideo, as a special guest. She also carried out an activity on language, sexism, and communication at the Centro de Formación de la Cooperación Española (Spanish Cooperation Training Center). Since she arrived in Valencia, Meana has actively participated in the Casa de la Dona. In 2018, she was recognized as the adoptive daughter of Valencia for having developed her activism in the city with the aim of creating a more inclusive, open, and feminist society.",Normal
"In chemistry, a hydration reaction is a chemical reaction in which a substance combines with water. In organic chemistry, water is added to an unsaturated substrate, which is usually an alkene or an alkyne. This type of reaction is employed industrially to produce ethanol, isopropanol, and butan-2-ol. Several million tons of ethylene glycol are produced annually by the hydration of oxirane, a cyclic compound also known as ethylene oxide: Acid catalysts are typically used. For the hydration of alkenes, the general chemical equation of the reaction is the following: A hydroxyl group (OH−) attaches to one carbon of the double bond, and a proton (H+) adds to the other. The reaction is highly exothermic. In the first step, the alkene acts as a nucleophile and attacks the proton, following Markovnikov's rule. In the second step an H2O molecule bonds to the other, more highly substituted carbon. The oxygen atom at this point has three bonds and carries a positive charge (i.e., the molecule is an oxonium). Another water molecule comes along and takes up the extra proton. This reaction tends to yield many undesirable side products, (for example diethyl ether in the process of creating ethanol) and in its simple form described here is not considered very useful for the production of alcohol. Two approaches are taken. Traditionally the alkene is treated with sulfuric acid to give alkyl sulphate esters. In the case of ethanol production, this step can be written: Subsequently, this sulphate ester is hydrolyzed to regenerate sulphuric acid and release ethanol: This two step route is called the ""indirect process"". In the ""direct process,"" the acid protonates the alkene, and water reacts with this incipient carbocation to give the alcohol. The direct process is more popular because it is simpler. The acid catalysts include phosphoric acid and several solid acids. Here an example reaction mechanism of the hydration of 1-methylcyclohexene to 1-methylcyclohexanol: Many alternative routes are available for producing alcohols, including the hydroboration–oxidation reaction, the oxymercuration–reduction reaction, the Mukaiyama hydration, the reduction of ketones and aldehydes and as a biological method fermentation. Any unsaturated organic compound is susceptible to hydration. Acetylene hydrates to give acetaldehyde: The process typically relies on mercury catalysts and has been discontinued in the West but is still practiced in China. The Hg2+ center binds to a C≡C bond, which is then attacked by water. The reaction is Nitriles undergo hydration to give amides: This reaction is employed in the production of acrylamide. Aldehydes and to some extent even ketones, hydrate to geminal diols. The reaction is especially dominant for formaldehyde, which, in the presence of water, exists significantly as dihydroxymethane. Conceptually similar reactions include hydroamination and hydroalkoxylation, which involve adding amines and alcohols to alkenes. Hydration is an important process in many other applications; one example is the production of Portland cement by the crosslinking of calcium oxides and silicates that is induced by water. Hydration is the process by which desiccants function.",Normal

"In ancient times, comitatus was an armed escort or retinue, especially in the context of Germanic warrior culture for a warband tied to a leader by an oath of fealty. The concept describes the relations between a lord and his retainers, or thanes (OE þegn); scholars generally consider it more of a literary trope rather than one of historical accuracy. Scholars Bruce Mitchell and Fred C. Robinson describe the comitatus more fully: A heroic warrior brought up in this  tradition would show a reckless disregard for his life. Whether he was doomed or not, courage was best, for the brave man could win lof  while the coward might die before his time. This is the spirit which inspired the code of the comitatus. While his lord lived, the warrior owed him loyalty unto death. If his lord were killed, the warrior had to avenge him or die in the attempt. The lord in his turn had the duty of being generous to his warriors. He had to be the great fighter to attract men, a man of noble character and a generous giver of feasts and treasure to hold them. The comitatus ideal is seen in Old English heroic literature, such as The Battle of Maldon, Beowulf, The Battle of Brunanburh,The Battle of Finnsburh, and the story of ""Cynewulf and Cyneheard."" The comitatus is also examined through a Christian context in works such as Dream of the Rood, where Christ is depicted more as a warrior-king doing battle with the Devil and accepts physical defeat for spiritual victory. The rood, or cross, in the poem acts as a retainer ""who is forced by his very loyalty to become the instrument of his beloved Lord's execution."" In modern times, it is the (neo-)Latin term for a county (cf comes).(See la:Comitatus.) Posse comitatus (""powerforce of the county""; comitatus is 4th declension so the genitive termination is ūs), usually shortened to posse, is a group of people helping a sheriff or other official to enforce the law. The term comitatus is credited to the Roman historian Tacitus. In his treatise Germania (98.AD), the comitatus is the bond existing between a Germanic warrior and his lord, ensuring that the former never leaves the field of battle before the latter. The translation is as follows: Moreover, to survive the leader and retreat from the battlefield is a lifelong disgrace and infamy Tacitus stressed the abnegation of the follower, and his dependence on his patron, whose prestige rested on his ability to successfully wage war, and thus provide a military training for his followers. Loyalty was met by material reward. Tacitus states that Germanic chiefs, or lords, were to not be surpassed by the courage of their followers on the battlefield. For the chief, being surpassed by a thane in courage was considered a disgrace. Chiefs were to fight for victory, and thanes were to fight for their chief. Although a chief was dishonored if he was surpassed in courage by a thane, his followers were disgraced if their courage did not match that of their chief. Retainers were expected to obey, protect, and defend their lord and allow their lord to receive credit for their own acts of heroism. The chief's glory resulted in the glory of his retainers. If a chief died in battle, his retainers were expected to avenge him and not leave battle. Leaving a battle alive after the lord had died meant lifelong shame for the retainer. To keep a warband together, it must consistently experience war and violence. Tacitus says that Germanic warriors did not tolerate long-term peace. After a victory, a lord or chief was expected to grant gifts to his retainers, such as a ""coveted war-horse or a spear stained with blood of a defeated enemy. Their  meals, for which plentiful if homely fare is provided, count in lieu of pay. The wherewithal for this openhandedness comes from war and plunder."" Regarding the armor and weapons of late first century Germanic warriors, Tacitus explains that few carried long lances or swords. More commonly, Germanic warriors bore frameae, or sharp spears with short, narrow blades that could be used in close quarters or in long-range fighting. Warriors who fought on horseback carried a shield and spear, and foot-soldiers often used javelins. Warriors, according to Tacitus, often fought naked or ""lightly clad in short cloaks."" Few warriors wore breastplates or helmets; however, any helmets worn were made out of animal hide or metal. A shield may bear the colors of a warrior's choice. Throwing away one's shield in the battlefield, or fleeing from battle, was considered a disgrace that could cause a warrior to be banned from attending assemblies and religious rituals and sacrifices. Tacitus describes the battle tactics of Germanic warriors, claiming that the strength of Germanic warriors was in their infantry rather than their cavalry, the horses of the Germans not being overly beautiful or fast and foot-soldiers having the speed to keep up with the cavalry. The best warriors were placed at the main battle-line along with the cavalry. Tacitus further explains the battle practices of Germanic warriors, ""The battle-line is made up of wedge-shaped formations. To give ground, provided that you return to the attack, is considered good tactics rather than cowardice. They  bring back the bodies of the fallen even when a battle hangs in the balance."" The comitatus has also been seen as an Indo-European concept that predates Roman times, practiced from Western Europe to China, especially among Eurasian steppe tribes. In early medieval England, a lord may foster the children and relatives of allied chiefdoms, which involved sending one's sons to the court of another kinsman or lord. The son(s) would then grow up with other boys similar to their age and be taught the art of warfare. They would reside at the court from the age of seven or eight until they turned fourteen or fifteen. At the age of fourteen or fifteen, they would be granted weapons that were appropriate to their status and would serve militarily in the comitatus. Fostering helped to create loyalty among chiefdoms, often because a lord was fostering his sons at other courts or because the boys he had fostered had grown up and become lords themselves. A lord's family also often comprised large portions of a lord's warband. A retainer's relationship to his lord was also supposed to be placed above his ties to his kin. For example, in the story of ""Cynewulf and Cyneheard,"" the comitatus was shown to be more important than ties to kinship for the members of the warrior class, warriors choosing to remain loyal to their lords even if this decision meant killing some of their own kinsmen who were on the enemy's side. Comitatus, being the agreement between a Germanic lord and his subservients (his Gefolge or host of followers), is a special case of clientage, and related to the practice of feudalism. Partly influenced by the Roman practice of patronage (patrocinium), - as exemplified by the lex agraria, of a general distributing land to his officers after their retirement, as well as by the later bucellarius or private follower - the Germanic comitatus eventually evolved into a wholesale exchange between a social superior and inferior. The feudal social inferior or vassal would pledge military service and protection to the superior (Lord). In return, the superior would reward the inferior with land, compensation, or privileges. The Germanic term for the comitatus is reconstructed as *druhtiz, with Old English forms dryht and druht, and Scandinavian drótt. Equivalents highlighting different features of the lordman bond include the trust-element of the early Frankish antrustio, royal bodyguard; the Danish vederlag or Society, and the Norse hird or household following. The Wife's Lament in the Exeter Book uses the language of the comitatus to sharpen awareness of the conflict between the wife's claim on her lover, and the brotherhood-claims of the lord and his followers: In the words of the Wife's Lament, ""that man's kinsmen began to think in secret that they would separate us."" How typical this is of the medieval genre of the frauenlied – with the romantic theme of a woman being left by her husband because he needs to be with his liege lord – is however debatable. Even in Anglo-Saxon England, if the Exeter Book contains few pieces featuring women or written from the female perspective, Beowulf by contrast has roles for women precisely in strengthening the cohesion and unity of the comitatus: thus the 'peace-weaver' (a woman given in marriage to resolve a feud) Queen Wealtheow makes the normative claim that “Here each comrade is true to the otherloyal to lord, loving in spirit.The thanes have one purpose, the people are ready:having drunk and pledged, the ranks do as I bid.”. Tacitus finds that women helped late first century Germanic warriors fight their battles. According to Tacitus, warbands were frequently composed of men of one family or clan and kept near to them their women and children during battles. Mothers and wives of warriors treated wounds and compared the war injuries of their men to other warriors. Women also gave encouragement and food to warriors in battle. If Germanic combatants were losing a battle, Tacitus claims that women aided the cause by ""thrusting forward their bare bosoms, and making them  realize the imminent prospect of enslavement -- a fate which the Germans feared more desperately for their women than for themselves."" Women were also believed by Germans to hold within them ""an element of holiness and a gift of prophecy; and so they  do not scorn to ask for their  advice, or lightly disregard their replies."" Tacitus supplies much of what scholars believe to know about the customs of Germanic tribes, the ancestors of the Anglo-Saxons, before they came to Britain during the fifth century and converted to Christianity. However, Tacitus's Germania must be viewed critically because his descriptions of the Germans were partly used to criticize what he viewed was the corruption and softness of the Roman empire around 100 A.D. In addition, much of Tacitus's information is not first hand knowledge but information he collected from others. Much of the evidence supporting the comitatus occurs centuries after the writings of Tacitus and are presented through oral heroic poetry. As a result, the comitatus is generally viewed more by scholars as a literary ideal rather than a historical reality. Regarding sources that support the comitatus, Stephen Morillo claims, ""Few topics in early medieval history are as obscure as the comitatus, or warband, perhaps the basic social and military unit of organization among the post-Roman ruling classes. Because the warband members were almost all illiterate, their world must come to us either through heroic oral poetry (often not recorded until long after the period in which the oral tradition thrived) or through hostile clerical chroniclers with little sympathy for warband values."" Stephen S. Evans, who examines the comitatus in England during the period between the fifth and eighth centuries, admits, ""Given the dearth of sources for this period as well as the differing rates of development of the various kingdoms, it is impossible to determine the precise degree to which the image of the comitatus manifested itself in the historical record at any given time or place."" Although Tacitus's work describes Germania in the late first century, there is also no guarantee that Germanic societies were the same when they arrived to England in the fifth century.",Normal

"The Bolotnaya Square case is a criminal case by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation on account of alleged mass riots (article 212 of the Russian Criminal code) and alleged violence against the police (article 318 of the Russian Criminal code) during the ""March of the Millions"" on May 6, 2012 on the Bolotnaya Square in Moscow. The demonstration was one of the biggest protests in Russia since the 1990s. By the number of accused, 37 persons, it is currently the largest criminal case against participants of public demonstrations in modern Russia. The Bolotnaya Square case is largely recognized as politically motivated both internationally and in Russia. The Russian Human Rights Ombudsman Vladimir Lukin repeatedly stated that ""there were no riots in Bolotnaya Square"". The Memorial Human Rights Centre recognized the case as politically motivated. The European Court of Human Rights issued numerous verdicts wherein it ruled that in the Bolotnaya Square case Russia violated European Convention on Human Rights. The European Parliament issued resolutions 20132667(RSP) of June 13, 2013 and resolution 20142628(RSP) of March 13, 2014 on the political nature of the Bolotnaya Square case. Amnesty International recognised the defendants in the case as prisoners of conscience. Overall, 37 people were officially accused, most of them were men and five were women. The majority of them were kept under arrest, several under house arrest, and one escaped abroad. Fearing persecution, several other people, who had not yet been officially accused, left Russia and have been granted asylum in Estonia, Finland, Germany, Lithuania, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. The case also included a crackdown against the Russian opposition leaders. Houses of Alexey Navalny, Sergey Udaltsov, Kseniya Sobchak, Boris Nemtsov, Ilya Yashin and Pyotr Verzilov were searched. Garry Kasparov and Sergei Guriev left Russia in 2013. The supporters of the arrested created the May 6 Committee, an independent organization set up to conduct its own investigation and defend those charged in connection with the rally. Dozens of prominent musicians and artists publicly supported the prisoners of the Bolotnaya Square case, among them Anti-Flag, Ken Loach, Yuri Shevchuk, Noize MC, Boris Akunin, Dmitry Spirin. On December 19, 2013 a large-scale amnesty was declared in Russia to mark the 20th anniversary of the Russian Constitution. The amnesty was granted to some 13 defendants in the Bolotnaya Square case, alongside the accused in the two other high-profile political cases, the Pussy Riot group and Greenpeace activists who blocked the Prirazlomnaya oil platform in the Pechora Sea. In 2014, the remaining defendants in the Bolotnaya Square case who did not fall under the amnesty received prison sentences varying from 2.5 to 4.5 years.

"Prism lighting is the use of prisms to improve the distribution of light in a space. It is usually used to distribute daylight, and is a form of anidolic lighting. Prism lighting was popular from its introduction in the 1890s through to the 1930s, when cheap electric lights became commonplace and prism lighting became unfashionable. While mass production of prism lighting systems ended around 1940, the 2010s have seen a revival using new materials. The human eye's response to light is non-linear: halving the light level does not halve the perceived brightness of a space, it makes it look only slightly dimmer. If light is redistributed from the brightest parts of a room to the dimmest, the room therefore appears brighter overall, and more space can be given a useful and comfortable level of illumination (see before and after images from an 1899 article, below). This can reduce the need for artificial lighting. Refraction and total internal reflection inside optical prisms can bend beams of light. This bending of the light allows it to be redistributed. Many small prisms may be joined at the edges into a sheet. A prism sheet is somewhat like a linear Fresnel lens, but each ridge may be identical. Unlike a Fresnel lens, the light is not intended to be focussed, but used for anidolic lighting. Deck prisms carried light through the upper decks of ships and spread it in the decks below. Similarly, on land, prisms in sidewalk lights were used to light basements and vaults. Prism tiles were used vertically, usually as a transom light above a window or door. They were also built into fixed and movable canopies, sloped glazing, and skylights. They bend light upwards, so that it penetrates more deeply into the room, rather than lighting the floor near the window. Modern prismatic panels are essentially an acrylic version of the old glass prism tiles. Like glass tiles, they can be mounted on adjustable canopies. Channel panels use slits that reflect light internally. Holographic optical elements can also be used to redirect light. Daylight redirecting window film (DRF) is a thin, flexible peel-and-stick sheet, with the optical layer generally made of acrylic. There are two types of film. Some film is moulded with tiny prisms, making a flexible peel-and-stick miniature prismatic panel. Other film is moulded with thin near-horizontal voids protruding into or through the acrylic; the slits reflect light hitting their top surfaces upwards. Refraction is minimized, to avoid colouring the light. The reflection-based films are more transparent (both are translucent), but they tend to send the light up at the ceiling, not deeper into the room. Refraction-based films are translucent rather than transparent, but offer finer control over the direction of the outgoing light beam; the film can be made in a variety of prism shapes to refract light by a variety of angles. Older glass elements were cast, and might be cut and polished. Prism tiles were often made of single prisms joined with zinc, lead, or electroglazed copper strips (rather like the methods used to join traditional European stained glass). Sidewalk prisms were cast in one piece as single or multiple-prism lenses, and inserted into load-bearing frames. Daylight redirecting film is made of acrylic. Damaged prism tiles may be repaired, and as they came in standard designs, there is a salvage market in replacements. Replacements for one-piece castings can be commissioned. Weakened prism tiles may be reinforced with hidden bars, much like those used to reinforce stained glass. Sophisticated systems for lighting different sorts of spaces with prism tiles were developed. Generally, the goal was to send the available light across the room nearly horizontally. One company sold tiles with nine prescriptions, giving different angles of refraction. Different prescriptions were often used in different parts of the same window transom, sometimes to disperse the light vertically, and sometimes to bend light horizontally around obstacles like pillars. Prism tiles sometimes have elaborate artistic designs moulded into the outside; Frank Lloyd Wright created over forty prism tile designs. Prism lighting works more effectively in light, open spaces. Some believe that it contributed to the trend away from dark, subdivided Victorian interiors to open-plan, light-coloured ones. The removal or covering of old prism transom lights often leaves characteristically tall signage spaces over shop windows (see pictures). Daylight redirecting window film was initially made of one redirecting film and one glare-reducing diffusing film, often located on different interior surfaces of a double-glazed window, but integrated single films are now available. Some daylight redirecting films reflect incoming light upwards off tiny near-horizontal reflectors, so at high sun angles they bend it sharply, throwing it upwards to the ceiling, where a typical ceiling diffuses the daylight somewhat deeper into the space. Other daylight redirecting films refract light at any specified angle, ideally sending it nearly horizontally into the room. Redirecting films can be used as a substitute for opaque blinds.",Normal
"KNME-TV (channel 5), branded on-air as NM PBS, is a PBS member television station in Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States. Jointly owned by the University of New Mexico and Albuquerque Public Schools, it is a sister station to Santa Fe–licensed KNMD-TV (channel 5). Both stations share studios on UNM's North Campus on University Boulevard Northeast in Albuquerque, while KNME-TV's transmitter is located atop Sandia Crest. In 1957, the University of New Mexico Board of Regents and Albuquerque Public Schools reached a deal to jointly file for the channel 5 educational allocation in Albuquerque. The application was filed with the Federal Communications Commission on July 19 and granted on October 23. Plans were drawn up to use the new station to beam junior college classes to outlying areas, while a studio was set up in a converted sorority house on the UNM campus. Edith Buchanan's English class was the first program broadcast over KNME-TV on May 1, 1958. By 1960, the station had expanded from college courses to provide programs for Albuquerque public school students in science and Spanish. That same year, a Ford Foundation grant enabled the station to purchase its first video tape equipment. In 1969, KNME began live coverage of the New Mexico state legislature. New Mexico PBS produces several television programs, including: Local programs have also included reports leading up to and after the New Mexico State Penitentiary riot and the Peabody Award-winning series Surviving Columbus on the Pueblo Indians (1992). KNME also operates the satellite service WestLink, which shares programming with other public television stations and several commercial clients. Satellite interviews from New Mexico on news networks like CNN often originate at New Mexico PBS. Shows distributed on WestLink include Democracy Now! and Creative Living with Sheryl Borden. From 1995 to 2010, KNME operated TALNET (an acronym for ""Teach and Learn Network""), an educational cable channel for Albuquerque. It broadcast a mix of PBS and Annenberg Media programming and local school board meetings on Comcast cable channel 96 in Albuquerque. The station's digital signal is multiplexed: KNME-TV was first in New Mexico to broadcast a digital signal, signing on KNME-DT in 2001. On January 18, 2017, PBS Kids replaced the Spanish-language V-me network, which had aired on channel 5.2 for about ten years, with V-me planning to transition to a commercial cable channel in 2017. The channel, however, had never caught on with Spanish-speaking audiences. Since Fall 2016, KNME carries First Nations Experience (FNX), a channel devoted to Native American programming. On February 15, 2021, World Channel began airing on channel 5.4 and Create debuted on 5.5. These channels, simulcasts of KNMD-TV 9.1 and 9.2, were added in preparation for KNMD-TV's planned June 30 conversion to ATSC 3.0 format; KNMD-TV simulcasts the entire KNME multiplex. KNME-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 5, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 35. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 5.",Normal

"An avalanche is a rapid flow of snow down a slope, such as a hill or mountain. Avalanches can be set off spontaneously, by factors such as increased precipitation or snowpack weakening, or by external means such as humans, other animals, and earthquakes. Primarily composed of flowing snow and air, large avalanches have the capability to capture and move ice, rocks, and trees. Avalanches occur in two general forms, or combinations thereof: slab avalanches made of tightly packed snow, triggered by a collapse of an underlying weak snow layer, and loose snow avalanches made of looser snow. After being set off, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they capture more snow. If an avalanche moves fast enough, some of the snow may mix with the air, forming a powder snow avalanche. Though they appear to share similarities, avalanches are distinct from slush flows, mudslides, rock slides, and serac collapses. They are also different from large scale movements of ice. Avalanches can happen in any mountain range that has an enduring snowpack. They are most frequent in winter or spring, but may occur at any time of the year. In mountainous areas, avalanches are among the most serious natural hazards to life and property, so great efforts are made in avalanche control. There are many classification systems for the different forms of avalanches, which vary according to their users' needs. Avalanches can be described by their size, destructive potential, initiation mechanism, composition, and dynamics. Most avalanches occur spontaneously during storms under increased load due to snowfall andor erosion. The second largest cause of natural avalanches is metamorphic changes in the snowpack such as melting due to solar radiation. Other natural causes include rain, earthquakes, rockfall and icefall. Artificial triggers of avalanches include skiers, snowmobiles, and controlled explosive work. Contrary to popular belief, avalanches are not triggered by loud sound; the pressure from sound is orders of magnitude too small to trigger an avalanche. Avalanche initiation can start at a point with only a small amount of snow moving initially; this is typical of wet snow avalanches or avalanches in dry unconsolidated snow. However, if the snow has sintered into a stiff slab overlying a weak layer then fractures can propagate very rapidly, so that a large volume of snow, that may be thousands of cubic metres, can start moving almost simultaneously. A snowpack will fail when the load exceeds the strength. The load is straightforward; it is the weight of the snow. However, the strength of the snowpack is much more difficult to determine and is extremely heterogeneous. It varies in detail with properties of the snow grains, size, density, morphology, temperature, water content; and the properties of the bonds between the grains. These properties may all metamorphose in time according to the local humidity, water vapour flux, temperature and heat flux. The top of the snowpack is also extensively influenced by incoming radiation and the local air flow. One of the aims of avalanche research is to develop and validate computer models that can describe the evolution of the seasonal snowpack over time. A complicating factor is the complex interaction of terrain and weather, which causes significant spatial and temporal variability of the depths, crystal forms, and layering of the seasonal snowpack. Slab avalanches form frequently in snow that has been deposited, or redeposited by wind. They have the characteristic appearance of a block (slab) of snow cut out from its surroundings by fractures. Elements of slab avalanches include the following: a crown fracture at the top of the start zone, flank fractures on the sides of the start zones, and a fracture at the bottom called the stauchwall. The crown and flank fractures are vertical walls in the snow delineating the snow that was entrained in the avalanche from the snow that remained on the slope. Slabs can vary in thickness from a few centimetres to three metres. Slab avalanches account for around 90% of avalanche-related fatalities in backcountry users. The largest avalanches form turbulent suspension currents known as powder snow avalanches or mixed avalanches, a kind of gravity current. These consist of a powder cloud, which overlies a dense avalanche. They can form from any type of snow or initiation mechanism, but usually occur with fresh dry powder. They can exceed speeds of 300kmh (190mph), and masses of 10,000,000 tonnes; their flows can travel long distances along flat valley bottoms and even uphill for short distances. In contrast to powder snow avalanches, wet snow avalanches are a low velocity suspension of snow and water, with the flow confined to the track surface (McClung, 1999, p.108). The low speed of travel is due to the friction between the sliding surface of the track and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (≈10–40kmh), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass and density. The body of the flow of a wet snow avalanche can plough through soft snow, and can scour boulders, earth, trees, and other vegetation; leaving exposed and often scored ground in the avalanche track. Wet snow avalanches can be initiated from either loose snow releases, or slab releases, and only occur in snowpacks that are water saturated and isothermally equilibrated to the melting point of water. The isothermal characteristic of wet snow avalanches has led to the secondary term of isothermal slides found in the literature (for example in Daffern, 1999, p.93). At temperate latitudes wet snow avalanches are frequently associated with climatic avalanche cycles at the end of the winter season, when there is significant daytime warming. An ice avalanche occurs when a large piece of ice, such as from a serac or calving glacier, falls onto ice (such as the Khumbu Icefall), triggering a movement of broken ice chunks. The resulting movement is more analogous to a rockfall or a landslide than a snow avalanche. They are typically very difficult to predict and almost impossible to mitigate. As an avalanche moves down a slope it follows a certain pathway that is dependent on the slope's degree of steepness and the volume of snowice involved in the mass movement. The origin of an avalanche is called the Starting Point and typically occurs on a 30–45 degree slope. The body of the pathway is called the Track of the avalanche and usually occurs on a 20–30 degree slope. When the avalanche loses its momentum and eventually stops it reaches the Runout Zone. This usually occurs when the slope has reached a steepness that is less than 20 degrees. These degrees are not consistently true due to the fact that each avalanche is unique depending on the stability of the snowpack that it was derived from as well as the environmental or human influences that triggered the mass movement. People caught in avalanches can die from suffocation, trauma, or hypothermia. From ""1950–1951 to 2020–2021"" there were 1,169 people who died in avalanches in the United States. For the 11-year period ending April 2006 445 people died in avalanches throughout North America. On average, 28 people die in avalanches every winter in the United States. In 2001 it was reported that globally an average of 150 people die each year from avalanches. Three of the deadliest recorded avalanches have killed over a thousand people each. Doug Fesler and Jill Fredston developed a conceptual model of the three primary elements of avalanches: terrain, weather, and snowpack. Terrain describes the places where avalanches occur, weather describes the meteorological conditions that create the snowpack, and snowpack describes the structural characteristics of snow that make avalanche formation possible. Avalanche formation requires a slope shallow enough for snow to accumulate but steep enough for the snow to accelerate once set in motion by the combination of mechanical failure (of the snowpack) and gravity. The angle of the slope that can hold snow, called the angle of repose, depends on a variety of factors such as crystal form and moisture content. Some forms of drier and colder snow will only stick to shallower slopes, while wet and warm snow can bond to very steep surfaces. In particular, in coastal mountains, such as the Cordillera del Paine region of Patagonia, deep snowpacks collect on vertical and even overhanging rock faces. The slope angle that can allow moving snow to accelerate depends on a variety of factors such as the snow's shear strength (which is itself dependent upon crystal form) and the configuration of layers and inter-layer interfaces. The snowpack on slopes with sunny exposures is strongly influenced by sunshine. Diurnal cycles of thawing and refreezing can stabilize the snowpack by promoting settlement. Strong freeze-thaw cycles result in the formation of surface crusts during the night and of unstable surface snow during the day. Slopes in the lee of a ridge or of another wind obstacle accumulate more snow and are more likely to include pockets of deep snow, wind slabs, and cornices, all of which, when disturbed, may result in avalanche formation. Conversely, the snowpack on a windward slope is often much shallower than on a lee slope. Avalanches and avalanche paths share common elements: a start zone where the avalanche originates, a track along which the avalanche flows, and a runout zone where the avalanche comes to rest. The debris deposit is the accumulated mass of the avalanched snow once it has come to rest in the run-out zone. For the image at left, many small avalanches form in this avalanche path every year, but most of these avalanches do not run the full vertical or horizontal length of the path. The frequency with which avalanches form in a given area is known as the return period. The start zone of an avalanche must be steep enough to allow snow to accelerate once set in motion, additionally convex slopes are less stable than concave slopes, because of the disparity between the tensile strength of snow layers and their compressive strength. The composition and structure of the ground surface beneath the snowpack influences the stability of the snowpack, either being a source of strength or weakness. Avalanches are unlikely to form in very thick forests, but boulders and sparsely distributed vegetation can create weak areas deep within the snowpack through the formation of strong temperature gradients. Full-depth avalanches (avalanches that sweep a slope virtually clean of snow cover) are more common on slopes with smooth ground, such as grass or rock slabs. Generally speaking, avalanches follow drainages down-slope, frequently sharing drainage features with summertime watersheds. At and below tree line, avalanche paths through drainages are well defined by vegetation boundaries called trim lines, which occur where avalanches have removed trees and prevented regrowth of large vegetation. Engineered drainages, such as the avalanche dam on Mount Stephen in Kicking Horse Pass, have been constructed to protect people and property by redirecting the flow of avalanches. Deep debris deposits from avalanches will collect in catchments at the terminus of a run out, such as gullies and river beds. Slopes flatter than 25degrees or steeper than 60degrees typically have a lower incidence of avalanches. Human-triggered avalanches have the greatest incidence when the snow's angle of repose is between 35 and 45degrees; the critical angle, the angle at which human-triggered avalanches are most frequent, is 38degrees. When the incidence of human triggered avalanches is normalized by the rates of recreational use, however, hazard increases uniformly with slope angle, and no significant difference in hazard for a given exposure direction can be found. The rule of thumb is: A slope that is flat enough to hold snow but steep enough to ski has the potential to generate an avalanche, regardless of the angle. The snowpack is composed of ground-parallel layers that accumulate over the winter. Each layer contains ice grains that are representative of the distinct meteorological conditions during which the snow formed and was deposited. Once deposited, a snow layer continues to evolve under the influence of the meteorological conditions that prevail after deposition. For an avalanche to occur, it is necessary that a snowpack have a weak layer (or instability) below a slab of cohesive snow. In practice the formal mechanical and structural factors related to snowpack instability are not directly observable outside of laboratories, thus the more easily observed properties of the snow layers (e.g. penetration resistance, grain size, grain type, temperature) are used as index measurements of the mechanical properties of the snow (e.g. tensile strength, friction coefficients, shear strength, and ductile strength). This results in two principal sources of uncertainty in determining snowpack stability based on snow structure: First, both the factors influencing snow stability and the specific characteristics of the snowpack vary widely within small areas and time scales, resulting in significant difficulty extrapolating point observations of snow layers across different scales of space and time. Second, the relationship between readily observable snowpack characteristics and the snowpack's critical mechanical properties has not been completely developed. While the deterministic relationship between snowpack characteristics and snowpack stability is still a matter of ongoing scientific study, there is a growing empirical understanding of the snow composition and deposition characteristics that influence the likelihood of an avalanche. Observation and experience has shown that newly fallen snow requires time to bond with the snow layers beneath it, especially if the new snow falls during very cold and dry conditions. If ambient air temperatures are cold enough, shallow snow above or around boulders, plants, and other discontinuities in the slope, weakens from rapid crystal growth that occurs in the presence of a critical temperature gradient. Large, angular snow crystals are indicators of weak snow, because such crystals have fewer bonds per unit volume than small, rounded crystals that pack tightly together. Consolidated snow is less likely to slough than loose powdery layers or wet isothermal snow; however, consolidated snow is a necessary condition for the occurrence of slab avalanches, and persistent instabilities within the snowpack can hide below well-consolidated surface layers. Uncertainty associated with the empirical understanding of the factors influencing snow stability leads most professional avalanche workers to recommend conservative use of avalanche terrain relative to current snowpack instability. Avalanches only occur in a standing snowpack. Typically winter seasons at high latitudes, high altitudes, or both have weather that is sufficiently unsettled and cold enough for precipitated snow to accumulate into a seasonal snowpack. Continentality, through its potentiating influence on the meteorological extremes experienced by snowpacks, is an important factor in the evolution of instabilities, and consequential occurrence of avalanches faster stabilization of the snowpack after storm cycles. The evolution of the snowpack is critically sensitive to small variations within the narrow range of meteorological conditions that allow for the accumulation of snow into a snowpack. Among the critical factors controlling snowpack evolution are: heating by the sun, radiational cooling, vertical temperature gradients in standing snow, snowfall amounts, and snow types. Generally, mild winter weather will promote the settlement and stabilization of the snowpack; conversely, very cold, windy, or hot weather will weaken the snowpack. At temperatures close to the freezing point of water, or during times of moderate solar radiation, a gentle freeze-thaw cycle will take place. The melting and refreezing of water in the snow strengthens the snowpack during the freezing phase and weakens it during the thawing phase. A rapid rise in temperature, to a point significantly above the freezing point of water, may cause avalanche formation at any time of year. Persistent cold temperatures can either prevent new snow from stabilizing or destabilize the existing snowpack. Cold air temperatures on the snow surface produce a temperature gradient in the snow, because the ground temperature at the base of the snowpack is usually around 0°C, and the ambient air temperature can be much colder. When a temperature gradient greater than 10°C change per vertical meter of snow is sustained for more than a day, angular crystals called depth hoar or facets begin forming in the snowpack because of rapid moisture transport along the temperature gradient. These angular crystals, which bond poorly to one another and the surrounding snow, often become a persistent weakness in the snowpack. When a slab lying on top of a persistent weakness is loaded by a force greater than the strength of the slab and persistent weak layer, the persistent weak layer can fail and generate an avalanche. Any wind stronger than a light breeze can contribute to a rapid accumulation of snow on sheltered slopes downwind. Wind slabs form quickly and, if present, weaker snow below the slab may not have time to adjust to the new load. Even on a clear day, wind can quickly load a slope with snow by blowing snow from one place to another. Top-loading occurs when wind deposits snow from the top of a slope; cross-loading occurs when wind deposits snow parallel to the slope. When a wind blows over the top of a mountain, the leeward, or downwind, side of the mountain experiences top-loading, from the top to the bottom of that lee slope. When the wind blows across a ridge that leads up the mountain, the leeward side of the ridge is subject to cross-loading. Cross-loaded wind-slabs are usually difficult to identify visually. Snowstorms and rainstorms are important contributors to avalanche danger. Heavy snowfall will cause instability in the existing snowpack, both because of the additional weight and because the new snow has insufficient time to bond to underlying snow layers. Rain has a similar effect. In the short-term, rain causes instability because, like a heavy snowfall, it imposes an additional load on the snowpack; and, once rainwater seeps down through the snow, it acts as a lubricant, reducing the natural friction between snow layers that holds the snowpack together. Most avalanches happen during or soon after a storm. Daytime exposure to sunlight will rapidly destabilize the upper layers of the snowpack if the sunlight is strong enough to melt the snow, thereby reducing its hardness. During clear nights, the snowpack can re-freeze when ambient air temperatures fall below freezing, through the process of long-wave radiative cooling, or both. Radiative heat loss occurs when the night air is significantly cooler than the snowpack, and the heat stored in the snow is re-radiated into the atmosphere. When a slab avalanche forms, the slab disintegrates into increasingly smaller fragments as the snow travels downhill. If the fragments become small enough the outer layer of the avalanche, called a saltation layer, takes on the characteristics of a fluid. When sufficiently fine particles are present they can become airborne and, given a sufficient quantity of airborne snow, this portion of the avalanche can become separated from the bulk of the avalanche and travel a greater distance as a powder snow avalanche. Scientific studies using radar, following the 1999 Galtür avalanche disaster, confirmed the hypothesis that a saltation layer forms between the surface and the airborne components of an avalanche, which can also separate from the bulk of the avalanche. Driving an avalanche is the component of the avalanche's weight parallel to the slope; as the avalanche progresses any unstable snow in its path will tend to become incorporated, so increasing the overall weight. This force will increase as the steepness of the slope increases, and diminish as the slope flattens. Resisting this are a number of components that are thought to interact with each other: the friction between the avalanche and the surface beneath; friction between the air and snow within the fluid; fluid-dynamic drag at the leading edge of the avalanche; shear resistance between the avalanche and the air through which it is passing, and shear resistance between the fragments within the avalanche itself. An avalanche will continue to accelerate until the resistance exceeds the forward force. Attempts to model avalanche behaviour date from the early 20th century, notably the work of Professor Lagotala in preparation for the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix. His method was developed by A. Voellmy and popularised following the publication in 1955 of his Ueber die Zerstoerungskraft von Lawinen (On the Destructive Force of Avalanches). Voellmy used a simple empirical formula, treating an avalanche as a sliding block of snow moving with a drag force that was proportional to the square of the speed of its flow: He and others subsequently derived other formulae that take other factors into account, with the Voellmy-Salm-Gubler and the Perla-Cheng-McClung models becoming most widely used as simple tools to model flowing (as opposed to powder snow) avalanches. Since the 1990s many more sophisticated models have been developed. In Europe much of the recent work was carried out as part of the SATSIE (Avalanche Studies and Model Validation in Europe) research project supported by the European Commission which produced the leading-edge MN2L model, now in use with the Service Restauration des Terrains en Montagne (Mountain Rescue Service) in France, and D2FRAM (Dynamical Two-Flow-Regime Avalanche Model), which was still undergoing validation as of 2007. Other known models are the SAMOS-AT avalanche simulation software and the RAMMS software. Preventative measures are employed in areas where avalanches pose a significant threat to people, such as ski resorts, mountain towns, roads, and railways. There are several ways to prevent avalanches and lessen their power and develop preventative measures to reduce the likelihood and size of avalanches by disrupting the structure of the snowpack, while passive measures reinforce and stabilize the snowpack in situ. The simplest active measure is repeatedly traveling on a snowpack as snow accumulates; this can be by means of boot-packing, ski-cutting, or machine grooming. Explosives are used extensively to prevent avalanches, by triggering smaller avalanches that break down instabilities in the snowpack, and removing overburden that can result in larger avalanches. Explosive charges are delivered by a number of methods including hand-tossed charges, helicopter-dropped bombs, Gazex concussion lines, and ballistic projectiles launched by air cannons and artillery. Passive preventive systems such as snow fences and light walls can be used to direct the placement of snow. Snow builds up around the fence, especially the side that faces the prevailing winds. Downwind of the fence, snow build-up is lessened. This is caused by the loss of snow at the fence that would have been deposited and the pickup of the snow that is already there by the wind, which was depleted of snow at the fence. When there is a sufficient density of trees, they can greatly reduce the strength of avalanches. They hold snow in place and when there is an avalanche, the impact of the snow against the trees slows it down. Trees can either be planted or they can be conserved, such as in the building of a ski resort, to reduce the strength of avalanches. In turn, socio-environmental changes can influence the occurrence of damaging avalanches: some studies linking changes in land-useland-cover patterns and the evolution of snow avalanche damage in mid latitude mountains show the importance of the role played by vegetation cover, that is at the root of the increase of damage when the protective forest is deforested (because of demographic growth, intensive grazing and industrial or legal causes), and at the root of the decrease of damage because of the transformation of a traditional land-management system based on overexploitation into a system based on land marginalization and reforestation, something that has happened mainly since the mid-20th century in mountain environments of developed countries In many areas, regular avalanche tracks can be identified and precautions can be taken to minimize damage, such as the prevention of development in these areas. To mitigate the effect of avalanches the construction of artificial barriers can be very effective in reducing avalanche damage. There are several types: One kind of barrier (snow net) uses a net strung between poles that are anchored by guy wires in addition to their foundations. These barriers are similar to those used for rockslides. Another type of barrier is a rigid fence-like structure (snow fence) and may be constructed of steel, wood or pre-stressed concrete. They usually have gaps between the beams and are built perpendicular to the slope, with reinforcing beams on the downhill side. Rigid barriers are often considered unsightly, especially when many rows must be built. They are also expensive and vulnerable to damage from falling rocks in the warmer months. In addition to industrially manufactured barriers, landscaped barriers, called avalanche dams stop or deflect avalanches with their weight and strength. These barriers are made out of concrete, rocks, or earth. They are usually placed right above the structure, road, or railway that they are trying to protect, although they can also be used to channel avalanches into other barriers. Occasionally, earth mounds are placed in the avalanche's path to slow it down. Finally, along transportation corridors, large shelters, called snow sheds, can be built directly in the slide path of an avalanche to protect traffic from avalanches. Warning systems can detect avalanches which develop slowly, such as ice avalanches caused by icefalls from glaciers. Interferometric radars, high-resolution cameras, or motion sensors can monitor instable areas over a long term, lasting from days to years. Experts interpret the recorded data and are able to recognize upcoming ruptures in order to initiate appropriate measures. Such systems (e.g. the monitoring of the Weissmies glacier in Switzerland) can recognize events several days in advance. Modern radar technology enables the monitoring of large areas and the localization of avalanches at any weather condition, by day and by night. Complex alarm systems are able to detect avalanches within a short time in order to close (e.g. roads and rails) or evacuate (e.g. construction sites) endangered areas. An example of such a system is installed on the only access road of Zermatt in Switzerland. Two radars monitor the slope of a mountain above the road. The system automatically closes the road by activating several barriers and traffic lights within seconds such that no people are harmed. Avalanche accidents are broadly differentiated into 2 categories: accidents in recreational settings, and accidents in residential, industrial, and transportation settings. This distinction is motivated by the observed difference in the causes of avalanche accidents in the two settings. In the recreational setting most accidents are caused by the people involved in the avalanche. In a 1996 study, Jamieson et al. (pages 7–20) found that 83% of all avalanches in the recreational setting were caused by those who were involved in the accident. In contrast, all of the accidents in the residential, industrial, and transportation settings were due to spontaneous natural avalanches. Because of the difference in the causes of avalanche accidents, and the activities pursued in the two settings, avalanche and disaster management professionals have developed two related preparedness, rescue, and recovery strategies for each of the settings. Two avalanches occurred in March 1910 in the Cascade and Selkirk Mountain ranges; on 1 March the Wellington avalanche killed 96 in Washington state, United States. Three days later 62 railroad workers were killed in the Rogers Pass avalanche in British Columbia, Canada. During World War I, an estimated 40,000 to 80,000 soldiers died as a result of avalanches during the mountain campaign in the Alps at the Austrian-Italian front, many of which were caused by artillery fire. Some 10,000 men, from both sides, died in avalanches in December 1916. In the northern hemisphere winter of 1950–1951 approximately 649 avalanches were recorded in a three-month period throughout the Alps in Austria, France, Switzerland, Italy and Germany. This series of avalanches killed around 265 people and was termed the Winter of Terror. A mountain climbing camp on Lenin Peak, in what is now Kyrgyzstan, was wiped out in 1990 when an earthquake triggered a large avalanche that overran the camp. Forty-three climbers were killed. In 1993, the Bayburt Üzengili avalanche killed 60 individuals in Üzengili in the province of Bayburt, Turkey. A large avalanche in Montroc, France, in 1999, 300,000cubic metres of snow slid on a 30° slope, achieving a speed in the region of 100kmh (62mph). It killed 12 people in their chalets under 100,000tons of snow, 5 meters (16 feet) deep. The mayor of Chamonix was convicted of second-degree murder for not evacuating the area, but received a suspended sentence. The small Austrian village of Galtür was hit by the Galtür avalanche in 1999. The village was thought to be in a safe zone but the avalanche was exceptionally large and flowed into the village. Thirty-one people died. On 1 December 2000, the Glory Bowl Avalanche formed on Mt. Glory which is located within the Teton Mountain Range in Wyoming, United States. Joel Roof was snowboarding recreationally in this backcountry, bowl-shaped run and triggered the avalanche. He was carried nearly 2,000 feet to the base of the mountain and was not successfully rescued. On 3 July 2022 a serac collapsed on the Marmolada Glacier, Italy, causing an avalanche that killed 11 alpinists and injured 8. In Europe, the avalanche risk is widely rated on the following scale, which was adopted in April 1993 to replace the earlier non-standard national schemes. Descriptions were last updated in May 2003 to enhance uniformity. In France, most avalanche deaths occur at risk levels 3 and 4. In Switzerland most occur at levels 2 and 3. It is thought that this may be due to national differences of interpretation when assessing the risks.  Stability:  additional load: Gradient: Avalanche size: In the United States and Canada, the following avalanche danger scale is used. Descriptors vary depending on country. There are nine different types of avalanche problems: The Canadian classification for avalanche size is based upon the consequences of the avalanche. Half sizes are commonly used. The size of avalanches are classified using two scales; size relative to destructive force or D-scale and size relative to the avalanche path or R-scale. Both size scales range from 1 to 5 with the D size scale half sizes can be used. Slab avalanche hazard analysis can be done using the Rutschblock Test. A 2m wide block of snow is isolated from the rest of the slope and progressively loaded. The result is a rating of slope stability on a seven step scale. (Rutsch means slide in German). Avalanche formation and frequency is highly affected by weather patterns and the local climate. Snowpack layers will form differently depending on whether snow is falling in very cold or very warm conditions, and very dry or very humid conditions. Thus, climate change may affect when, where, and how often avalanches occur, and may also change the type of avalanches that are occurring. Overall, a rising seasonal snow line and a decrease in the number of days with snow cover are predicted. Climate change-caused temperature increases and changes in precipitation patterns will likely differ between the different mountain regions, and the impacts of these changes on avalanches will change at different elevations. In the long term, avalanche frequency at lower elevations is expected to decline corresponding to a decrease in snow cover and depth, and a short-term increase in the number of wet avalanches are predicted. Precipitation is expected to increase, meaning more snow or rain depending on the elevation. Higher elevations predicted to remain above the seasonal snow line will likely see an increase in avalanche activity due to the increases in precipitation during the winter season. Storm precipitation intensity is also expected to increase, which is likely to lead to more days with enough snowfall to cause the snowpack to become unstable. Moderate and high elevations may see an increase in volatile swings from one weather extreme to the other. Predictions also show an increase in the number of rain on snow events, and wet avalanche cycles occurring earlier in the spring during the remainder of this century. The warm, wet snowpacks that are likely to increase in frequency due to climate change may also make avalanche burials more deadly. Warm snow has a higher moisture content and is therefore denser than colder snow. Denser avalanche debris decreases the ability for a buried person to breath and the amount of time they have before they run out of oxygen. This increases the likelihood of death by asphyxia in the event of a burial. Additionally, the predicted thinner snowpacks may increase the frequency of injuries due to trauma, such as a buried skier striking a rock or tree.",Normal

"A pharmacological chaperone or pharmacoperone is a drug that acts as a protein chaperone. That is, it contains small molecules that enter cells and serve as a molecular scaffolding in order to cause otherwise-misfolded mutant proteins to fold and route correctly within the cell. Mutation of proteins often causes molecular misfolding, which results in protein misrouting within the cell. Accordingly, mutant molecules may retain proper function but end up in parts of the cell where the function is inappropriate, or even deleterious, to cell function. Misfolded proteins are usually recognized by the quality-control system of the cell and retained (and often destroyed or recycled) in the endoplasmic reticulum. Pharmacoperones correct the folding of misfolded proteins, allowing them to pass through the cell's quality-control system and become correctly routed. Since mutations often cause disease by causing misfolding and misrouting, pharmacoperones are potentially therapeutic agents, since they are able to correct this defect. Diseases that may be susceptible to such treatments include diabetes, inherited cataracts and cystic fibrosis.",Normal

"Obaika Racing was an African professional stock car racing team. The team is owned by African entrepreneur Victor Obaika. The team competed in the NASCAR Cup Series and NASCAR Xfinity Series. The team formed in early 2015 and competed full-time in the Xfinity Series in 2015 and 2016. The team purchased some assets of BK Racing, a Monster Energy Cup Series team, in August 2018. The team was based in Mooresville, North Carolina, thirty minutes away from Charlotte Motor Speedway. It was the first African-owned team in NASCAR. In July 2018, Obaika obtained some equipment from the bankrupt NASCAR Cup Series team BK Racing for nearly $300,000. Around September 3, 2018, Obaika Racing owner Victor Obaika announced plans to race at some point in the remainder of the 2018 season. On October 5, 2018, Obaika announced that they would attempt their first ever Cup Series race at Talladega Superspeedway, fielding the No. 97 Vroombrands Toyota Camry for the 2018 1000Bulbs.com 500 with David Starr. He ultimately failed to qualify for the race. Obaika Racing later announced that they would attempt the last three races of the Cup Series season. The team made its official Cup Series debut at the 2018 AAA Texas 500, with Starr finishing at 39th place. Tanner Berryhill drove the No. 97 car at the 2018 Can-Am 500 at ISM Raceway and finished 31st. Berryhill drove the No. 97 again at Homestead-Miami Speedway and finished 38th. Obaika Racing planned to run a full-time Cup car in 2019 with Berryhill. On February 8, 2019, Obaika Racing withdrew from the 2019 Daytona 500 qualifying due to various circumstances. They were briefly on the entry list for the spring race in Texas, before withdrawing once again. The team ultimately didn't compete in a Cup race in 2019, and eventually folded in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 16, 2016, at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Obaika Racing introduced a second Chevrolet, the No. 77, also sponsored by VroomBrands. At Iowa Speedway, Claire Decker attempted to make her Xfinity Series debut driving this second Obaika car while her sister Paige ran the No. 97, but Claire failed to qualify on time and did not have owner points to fall back on. The No. 77 ran for much of the season's remainder, piloted by Ryan Ellis, Josh Bilicki, Austin Theriault, Matt Waltz, Jordan Anderson, TJ Bell, and Spencer Boyd. The No. 77 team was announced to be a full-time team along with the No. 97 team, having Stephen Leicht as the driver. However, the No. 77 team withdrew before the Daytona race as Leicht moved over the No. 97 team. The team entered in the next three races, but withdraw before the qualifying in all but one (Las Vegas), where Josh Bilicki failed to qualify. The team returned to the entry list after a four-month hiatus at Mid-Ohio with Ohio native Gregory Vandersluis as a late entry. The team withdrew two days later. They were on the entry list for the Road America Xfinity Race but withdrew again. The team was on the entry list for the Charlotte October race, once again withdrawing. Obaika Racing entered competition in 2015. The team signed driver Josh Reaume, who met team owner Victor Obaika while on humanitarian missions in Africa as a child. The 97 team debuted at the Daytona International Speedway in the Xfinity Series season-opening Alert Today Florida 300, with Reaume finishing 23rd. After three races, with one DNQ, Peyton Sellers replaced Reaume. In April 2015, the team secured their first sponsor vacation provider VroomBrands, which is owned by Obaika. VroomBrands wrapped the No. 97 in designs such as a Zebra representing their African safari package (debuted at Richmond International Raceway) and the Cheetah print representing their tours in Asia (debuted at Talladega Superspeedway). At the Winn-Dixie 300 at Talladega, Sellers scored the team's first top-20 finish, finishing 18th despite being involved in a ten-car wreck that sent cars spinning down pit road. Johanna Long replaced Sellers for the U.S. Cellular 250 at Iowa Speedway. After one more start for Sellers at Watkins Glen, the team introduced various drivers for the rest of the season. Dylan Kwasniewski debuted with the team in the Nationwide Children's Hospital at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, finishing 34th due to mechanical problems after running in the top 10. Kwasniewski would run the next two races for the team. Parker Kligerman drove the car in the VFW Sport Clips Help a Hero 200 at Darlington Raceway, Mason Mingus in the Furious 7 300 at Chicagoland Speedway, and Ryan Ellis in the Hisense 200 at the Dover International Speedway. Magic Creeper appeared as the primary sponsor for the DAV 200 at the Phoenix International Raceway, with Kwasniewski as the driver. Obaika Racing completed the season in the top 30 in owner points. On January 29, 2016, it was announced that Harrison Rhodes had been signed to drive the No. 97. Ryan Ellis, Alex Guenette, TJ Bell, Paige Decker, Matt Waltz, Josh Berry, Alli Owens, Jordan Anderson and Josh Bilicki all also raced for the team.  The team also planned to expand to two cars. In 2017, the team returned with Stephen Leicht driving in the early portion of the season but did not attempt a race after Bristol Motor Speedway in spring. Despite that, they were still shown in the game NASCAR Heat 2. On September 21, 2018, it was announced that Obaika would attempt the Charlotte Roval race, with Tanner Berryhill driving the 97 car. The team, however, failed to make the race. Obaika had planned to run a full-time Xfinity car in 2019, but nothing ever materialized. Obaika entered the 2018 race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway Dirt Track with South African driver Arnout Kok, marking the first K&N Pro Series West foray for both driver and team. However, the team withdrew from the race. Obaika paid another team to prepare a car for the race, but the car that was provided failed to pass inspection.",Normal

"Monta Vista is an upper-income residential neighborhood in western Cupertino, California, the 11th wealthiest city with a population over 50,000 in the United States. ""Monta Vista"" means ""mountain view"" however, it is not affiliated with the nearby city of Mountain View. Monta Vista in Cupertino is loosely referred to as the neighborhood that feeds into the high school  Orchards and vineyards used to cover Monta Vista. After the 1940s, Monta Vista became the first housing tract in the Cupertino area. Residential homes then quickly replaced the orchards and vineyards. When Cupertino decided to incorporate in 1955, Monta Vista decided at the last moment not to join the effort, remaining an unincorporated part of Santa Clara County. Over the years, Cupertino annexed pieces of Monta Vista as it was redeveloped lot by lot. By the late 1990s, only scattered pockets of unincorporated land were left in Monta Vista. Cupertino finally annexed the rest of the neighborhood in 2004. Starting in the mid 1980s and through the 2000s, settlement by affluent Asian American families accelerated initially driven by the rise in semiconductor and PC related industries and later via the rise of software, internet and other technology sectors. Currently, over 50% the neighborhood is Asian American and has a mix of newer generation as well as long time residents. Many of Monta Vista's residents work in Silicon Valley's technology industries in scientific, managerial, or entrepreneurial positions. Monta Vista homes are mainly detached single-family ranch-style houses ranging from 1200 to 2,800 square feet (260m2). The community also has a variety of custom built houses ranging from 3000–6,000 square feet (560m2) of living space area. Many smaller homes start from the mid $2 millions, mid-size homes start from the $3 millions, and larger custom homes start from the $4 millions and can go up to as much as $7 million, as of the 2022 peak. However, townhouses with similar square footage are relatively less expensive, owing mainly to negligible lot sizes and the many common walls and areas. The neighborhood is very sought-after due to its desirable location, low crime rate, and its academically high-performing schools, including Monta Vista High School and Kennedy Middle School. Monta Vista High School was ranked by Newsweek as one of the 100 top academically performing public high schools in the United States. Attractions in Monta Vista include the Fremont Older Open Space Preserve, Monte Bello Open Space Preserve, Picchetti Ranch Open Space Preserve (next to Picchetti Brothers Winery), Blackberry Farm, Deep Cliff Golf Course, Cupertino Hills Swim and Racquet Club, Linda Vista Park, Varian Park, Monta Vista Park and Stevens Creek Reservoir. McClellan Ranch Park, located just west of Monta Vista High School, is a nature preserve and historical park formerly owned by the McClellan family. Along with John T. Doyle, this family was one of the first residents of the area. This site also preserves the original ranch, milk barns and livestock barns with animals raised by resident volunteers.

"In mathematics, the Selberg trace formula, introduced by Selberg (1956), is an expression for the character of the unitary representation of a Lie group G on the space L2(ΓG) of square-integrable functions, where Γ is a cofinite discrete group. The character is given by the trace of certain functions on G. The simplest case is when Γ is cocompact, when the representation breaks up into discrete summands. Here the trace formula is an extension of the Frobenius formula for the character of an induced representation of finite groups. When Γ is the cocompact subgroup Z of the real numbers G = R, the Selberg trace formula is essentially the Poisson summation formula. The case when ΓG is not compact is harder, because there is a continuous spectrum, described using Eisenstein series. Selberg worked out the non-compact case when G is the group SL(2, R); the extension to higher rank groups is the Arthur–Selberg trace formula. When Γ is the fundamental group of a Riemann surface, the Selberg trace formula describes the spectrum of differential operators such as the Laplacian in terms of geometric data involving the lengths of geodesics on the Riemann surface. In this case the Selberg trace formula is formally similar to the explicit formulas relating the zeros of the Riemann zeta function to prime numbers, with the zeta zeros corresponding to eigenvalues of the Laplacian, and the primes corresponding to geodesics. Motivated by the analogy, Selberg introduced the Selberg zeta function of a Riemann surface, whose analytic properties are encoded by the Selberg trace formula. Cases of particular interest include those for which the space is a compact Riemann surface S. The initial publication in 1956 of Atle Selberg dealt with this case, its Laplacian differential operator and its powers. The traces of powers of a Laplacian can be used to define the Selberg zeta function. The interest of this case was the analogy between the formula obtained, and the explicit formulae of prime number theory. Here the closed geodesics on S play the role of prime numbers. At the same time, interest in the traces of Hecke operators was linked to the Eichler–Selberg trace formula, of Selberg and Martin Eichler, for a Hecke operator acting on a vector space of cusp forms of a given weight, for a given congruence subgroup of the modular group. Here the trace of the identity operator is the dimension of the vector space, i.e. the dimension of the space of modular forms of a given type: a quantity traditionally calculated by means of the Riemann–Roch theorem. The trace formula has applications to arithmetic geometry and number theory. For instance, using the trace theorem, Eichler and Shimura calculated the Hasse–Weil L-functions associated to modular curves; Goro Shimura's methods by-passed the analysis involved in the trace formula. The development of parabolic cohomology (from Eichler cohomology) provided a purely algebraic setting based on group cohomology, taking account of the cusps characteristic of non-compact Riemann surfaces and modular curves. The trace formula also has purely differential-geometric applications. For instance, by a result of Buser, the length spectrum of a Riemann surface is an isospectral invariant, essentially by the trace formula. The general theory of Eisenstein series was largely motivated by the requirement to separate out the continuous spectrum, which is characteristic of the non-compact case. The trace formula is often given for algebraic groups over the adeles rather than for Lie groups, because this makes the corresponding discrete subgroup Γ into an algebraic group over a field which is technically easier to work with. The case of SL2(C) is discussed in Gel'fand, Graev & Pyatetskii-Shapiro (1990) and Elstrodt, Grunewald & Mennicke (1998). Gel'fand et al also treat SL2(F) where F is a locally compact topological field with ultrametric norm, so a finite extension of the p-adic numbers Qp or of the formal Laurent series Fq((T)); they also handle the adelic case in characteristic 0, combining all completions R and Qp of the rational numbers Q. Contemporary successors of the theory are the Arthur–Selberg trace formula applying to the case of general semisimple G, and the many studies of the trace formula in the Langlands philosophy (dealing with technical issues such as endoscopy). The Selberg trace formula can be derived from the Arthur–Selberg trace formula with some effort. A compact hyperbolic surface X can be written as the space of orbits Γ ∖ H , {displaystyle Gamma backslash mathbf {H} ,} where Γ is a subgroup of PSL(2, R), and H is the upper half plane, and Γ acts on H by linear fractional transformations. The Selberg trace formula for this case is easier than the general case because the surface is compact so there is no continuous spectrum, and the group Γ has no parabolic or elliptic elements (other than the identity). Then the spectrum for the Laplace–Beltrami operator on X is discrete and real, since the Laplace operator is self adjoint with compact resolvent; that is 0 = μ 0 < μ 1 ≤ μ 2 ≤ ⋯ {displaystyle 0=mu _{0}<mu _{1}leq mu _{2}leq cdots } where the eigenvalues μn correspond to Γ-invariant eigenfunctions u in C∞(H) of the Laplacian; in other words { u ( γ z ) = u ( z ) , ∀ γ ∈ Γ y 2 ( u x x + u y y ) + μ n u = 0. {displaystyle {begin{cases}u(gamma z)=u(z),qquad forall gamma in Gamma y^{2}left(u_{xx}+u_{yy}right)+mu _{n}u=0.end{cases}}} Using the variable substitution μ = s ( 1 − s ) , s = 1 2 + i r {displaystyle mu =s(1-s),qquad s={tfrac {1}{2}}+ir} the eigenvalues are labeled r n , n ≥ 0. {displaystyle r_{n},ngeq 0.} Then the Selberg trace formula is given by ∑ n = 0 ∞ h ( r n ) = μ ( X ) 4 π ∫ − ∞ ∞ r h ( r ) tanh ⁡ ( π r ) d r + ∑ { T } log ⁡ N ( T 0 ) N ( T ) 1 2 − N ( T ) − 1 2 g ( log ⁡ N ( T ) ) . {displaystyle sum _{n=0}^{infty }h(r_{n})={frac {mu (X)}{4pi }}int _{-infty }^{infty }r,h(r)tanh(pi r),dr+sum _{{T}}{frac {log N(T_{0})}{N(T)^{frac {1}{2}}-N(T)^{-{frac {1}{2}}}}}g(log N(T)).} The right hand side is a sum over conjugacy classes of the group Γ, with the first term corresponding to the identity element and the remaining terms forming a sum over the other conjugacy classes {T } (which are all hyperbolic in this case). The function h has to satisfy the following: The function g is the Fourier transform of h, that is, h ( r ) = ∫ − ∞ ∞ g ( u ) e i r u d u . {displaystyle h(r)=int _{-infty }^{infty }g(u)e^{iru},du.}",Normal

"Amber Elaine Glenn (born October 28, 1999) is an American figure skater. She is a two-time ISU Grand Prix bronze medalist, a three-time ISU Challenger Series medalist, and the 2021 U.S. national silver medalist. She has finished within the top ten at two ISU Championships. Early in her career, she won bronze medals at two ISU Junior Grand Prix events (2013 JGP Czech Republic, 2014 JGP France) and was the 2014 U.S. Junior champion. Glenn is the sixth American woman to land a clean triple Axel in international competition. Glenn was born October 28, 1999, in Plano, Texas. Her father, Richard, works as a police officer. Glenn, who identifies as both bisexual and pansexual, is the only openly LGBTQ ladies' figure skater on Team USA as of December 2019. In November 2020, she revealed that she worked with the creative team of the Yuri on Ice movie during production in August 2017. Glenn began learning to skate in 2004. She won a bronze medal at the 2013 Junior Grand Prix (JGP) event in the Czech Republic and became a national junior champion at the 2014 U.S. Championships. Ranked fifth in the short program and eighth in the free skate, she finished seventh at the 2014 World Junior Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria. She trained in McKinney, Texas and at Stonebriar Ice in Frisco, Texas until the rink closed in 2014. In May 2014, U.S. Figure Skating named Glenn as the recipient of the 2014 Athlete Alumni Ambassador (3A) overall award. In August, she won bronze at the 2014 JGP in France. She finished sixth at her second JGP assignment in Estonia and 13th on the senior level at the 2015 U.S. Championships. Glenn began the 2015–2016 season training in McKinney, Texas under Ann Brumbaugh and Ben Shroats. After placing fifth at the 2015 JGP in Latvia and sixth on the senior level at the 2015 Skate Canada Autumn Classic in mid-October, she decided to take a break to ""reevaluate"". She resumed training in February 2016 after joining Peter Cain and Darlene Cain in Euless, Texas. Glenn placed fifth at the 2016 CS Nebelhorn Trophy, fourth at the 2016 CS Golden Spin of Zagreb, and eighth at the 2017 U.S. Championships. She was selected to compete at the 2017 World Junior Championships but withdrew in early March. Glenn finished eighth at the 2017 CS Lombardia Trophy. She was invited to compete at her first Grand Prix event, the 2017 Cup of China, after the withdrawal of Gracie Gold. She placed tenth in China and finished the season with a second consecutive eighth-place at the 2018 U.S. Championships. Glenn was sixth at the 2018 CS Lombardia Trophy and seventh at the 2019 U.S. Championships. Competing on the Challenger series again at the start of the 2019–2020 season, Glenn won the bronze medal at the 2019 CS U.S. Classic. This was her first senior international medal. Assigned to two Grand Prix events, she placed seventh at the 2019 Skate America and sixth at the 2019 Cup of China. She was fourth in the short program at the 2020 U.S. Championships with a clean skate and, remarking on her then-recent coming out, said it ""has brought a weight off my shoulders. It was very scary, and not having to pretend I’m someone I’m not anymore. She dropped to fifth place after the free skate and said further mental preparation was needed. Glenn finished ninth at the 2020 Four Continents Championships, her first senior ISU championship assignment. The coronavirus pandemic prompted a multi-month hiatus from training, after which Glenn began working on mastering the triple Axel, which she had been attempting ""for fun"" periodically for nine years by that point. She missed an early virtual competition due to fracturing her orbital bone after passing out during cryotherapy but then attempted the triple Axel for the first time in competition during a later virtual domestic event, singling it. With the pandemic restricting international travel, the ISU opted to conduct the Grand Prix assignments based mainly on training location. Glenn was assigned to compete at the 2020 Skate America. She placed fifth in the Skate America short program after having to execute a turn in between her triple-triple jump combination. She was sixth in the free skate, remaining in fifth place overall. Glenn attempted her triple Axel in the short program at the 2021 U.S. Championships but was unable to land it successfully. Her otherwise strong performances earned her her highest-ever placement at the event and first senior national medal, a silver. She expressed that she was ""happy to finally put out a performance I'm proud of."" Glenn revealed that she had been suffering from a foot infection that had spread up to the knee and had begun a course of antibiotics on the day of the free skate. Despite her silver medal, U.S. Figure Skating opted to name bronze medalist Karen Chen, who had finished 0.35 points behind Glenn, alongside champion Bradie Tennell to the 2021 World Championships team. It was the first time since 2008, when Katrina Hacker was bypassed in favor of Kimmie Meissner, that the selected ladies team in a non-Olympic year did not follow Nationals placements (for age-eligible skaters). Glenn was instead named first alternate. She had previously said, when asked about the prospect of the World team, ""US Figure Skating should go with a team that they know will go and get those three spots back. Whether that includes me or not, I’m all for it either way."" Glenn withdrew from the Skating Club of Boston's Cranberry Cup event and then made her full competitive debut at the 2021 CS Finlandia Trophy, where she placed tenth. Beginning the Grand Prix at 2021 Skate America, Glenn did not attempt a triple Axel in competition after practice session difficulties. Seventh in both segments of the competition, she placed sixth overall with a score of 201.02, breaking 200 points internationally for the first time. Speaking afterward, she said, ""breaking that point target internationally for the first time, it really makes me feel like I'm up there, and it's not just, ‘Oh, she got second at Nationals; she did this in her own country.’ I know I can hold my own internationally, and this is just a taste of that."" She went on to finish seventh at the 2021 NHK Trophy. Glenn concluded the fall season at the 2021 CS Golden Spin of Zagreb, where she won the silver medal. Attempting to qualify for the American Olympic team at the 2022 U.S. Championships in January, Glenn struggled in the short program and finished fourteenth in that segment. She tested positive for COVID-19 afterward and withdrew before the free skate. She was named as an alternate for the Olympic team. Glenn would later reflect that while she had not assumed that going to the Olympics was possible for most of her career due to the expectations raised after the previous national championships, ""I felt like I was expected to make it, so that made it all the more devastating. It was hard."" Before starting the season, Glenn relocated to Colorado Springs, Colorado to train under Damon Allen, Tammy Gambill, and Viktor Pfeifer. She said her departure from the Cains was amicable, reasoning that ""I needed to grow, not just as a skater, but as a human. I lived in the same city, the same place, my entire life."" Glenn started off her season with a bronze medal at the Skating Club of Boston's Cranberry Cup event before finishing fourth at the 2022 CS Lombardia Trophy. On the Grand Prix at 2022 Skate America, Glenn scored a personal best in her short program of 68.42, placing third in that segment and then third in the free skate as well to take the bronze medal. This was her first Grand Prix figure skating medal. On her performance in the free skate, she said afterward that ""knowing that I didn't feel 100% out there when I was skating and how much room for improvement, the possibilities are endless. It really kind of just blew my mind that I'm finally starting to reach my potential."" For the 2022 NHK Trophy, she vowed she was ""not playing it as safe"" as she had at her first event, ""I'm just going to really try and go all out."" The short program in Sapporo was a struggle, putting a hand down on her jump combination and then underrotating and falling on her final triple loop. She finished eleventh of twelve skaters in that segment. Glenn voiced her disappointment, saying, ""it's so disheartening to have a skate like that after working so hard."" She placed eighth in the free skate but remained eleventh overall. Glenn described ""mixed emotions"" approaching the 2023 U.S. Championships after her disappointment the previous year. In the short program she made an error on her triple loop jump, but still placed fourth in the segment. In the free skate she stepped out of her opening triple Axel attempt, but landed six other clean triples, despite doubling one planned triple and singling a planned double Axel. She was third in that segment, rising to win the bronze medal. Glenn said she was happy with how she performed, and that she had enjoyed the experience of the national championships and the crowd support. Assigned to the 2023 Four Continents Championships, Glenn placed fourth in the short program, 1.76 points behind third-place Kim Chae-yeon of South Korea. Her only error in the performance was putting a hand down on her solo triple loop. Glenn said that she ""didn't feel as energetic"" as she had wanted to be. Continuing to feel sick, she made two jump errors in the free skate and dropped to seventh overall, but said that she was glad to have stayed in a ""decent mental place"" given the difficulties. Glenn competed next at the 2023 World Championships in Saitama, where she finished twelfth despite underrotating her triple Axel attempt in the free skate. She said after that ""the free skate wasn't what I wanted or what I've been training, but I feel that mentally I held myself together."" Glenn then joined Team USA for the 2023 World Team Trophy in Tokyo, finishing sixth in both her segments of the competition. Team USA won the gold medal. For the new season's short program, choreographer Kaitlyn Weaver proposed to Glenn the Yeah Yeah Yeahs song ""Heads Will Roll"", which she initially considered ""out there"" for her, but subsequently accepted. Weaver's vogueing choreographer also appealed to her. After an on-ice collision with another skater in practice that set back her training by three weeks, she missed the Challenger series and other early competitions. Glenn was assigned to start the Grand Prix at Skate America, which had special significance for her as it was to be held within the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex in Allen, mere miles from her hometown of Plano. Glenn said it felt ""very bizarre"" to begin the season this late, but fared well in the short program, placing second in the segment with a new personal best score of 71.45. In the free skate, she made her fourteenth attempt at a triple Axel in competition, landing it cleanly for the first time. She was the fourth American woman to do so in international competition. However, she struggled in the second half of the program, falling twice and dropping to fifth place overall. Glenn said afterward that it felt ""incredible"" to land the triple Axel, but that afterward ""my own energy of the excitement killed me. I lost my focus."" Glenn had a ""disastrous"" short program at the 2023 Grand Prix of Espoo, finishing eleventh of twelve skaters after performing an invalid double flip instead of a triple and only managing a double toe loop as the second part of her improvised jump combination. She rebounded in the free skate with a new personal best score of 133.78, after her only error was singling her planned triple Axel. She came second in that segment, and rose to the bronze medal, her second on the Grand Prix. Glenn claimed she was ""so surprised"" at the result, but said she was now ""excited where the rest of the season goes.""",Normal

"Herbal viagra is a herbal product advertised as treating erectile dysfunction. Many different products are advertised as herbal viagra, but with varying ingredients. No clinical trials or scientific studies support the effectiveness of any of these ingredients for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and some products have been found to contain drugs and other adulterants, and have been the subject of FDA and FTC warnings and actions to remove them from the market. The name ""herbal viagra"" is taken from the brand name Viagra, under which drug company Pfizer sells sildenafil citrate, a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction. Viagra has become a generic term for many people discussing drugs designed to treat erectile dysfunction, even those which do not contain sildenafil. Herbal viagras, contrary to what the name suggests, do not normally contain sildenafil citrate. However, sildenafil and chemicals similar to sildenafil have been found as adulterants in many supplements which are sold as herbal viagra or ""natural"" sexual enhancement products. The United States Food and Drug Administration has warned consumers that any sexual enhancement product that claims to work as well as prescription products is likely to contain such a contaminant. Scientists estimated that over 60% of the consumed sildenafil in the Netherlands is from illegal sources such as adulterated dietary supplements. Herbal viagras often carry a number of dangerous side effects. Primarily, they cause abnormally low blood pressure and can restrict blood flow to vital organs. Some preparations may be toxic if taken in larger doses. Additional side effects and dangers of common herbal viagra adulterants, such as sulfoaildenafil, acetildenafil and other analogs, are unknown because these ingredients have not had thorough review in human clinical trials. Herbal viagra is predominantly sold through the internet, and in 2003 approximately 4% or 1 in 25 of all email spam offered herbal viagra, genuine pharmaceuticals, and other herbal remedies.",Normal
"Rebecca Merritt Smith Leonard Austin (March 10, 1832–March 1919, Chico, California) was a botanist and naturalist who collected and sold native plants in California and Oregon. Lomatium austiniae and Cephalanthera austiniae are named in her honor. She studied the chemistry, natural history of, and insects captured by the carnivorous pitcher plant Darlingtonia californica, and sold collected specimens to botanists and collectors. Her specimens are included in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution and the California Academy of Sciences. She carried on a regular correspondence with botanist J. G. Lemmon and others. Her experiments and correspondences have been published or cited by Asa Gray, John Gill Lemmon, William Marriott Canby, Frank Morton Jones, and other prominent botanists of the time. Rebecca Merritt Smith was born on March 10, 1832 in Cumberland County, Kentucky, one of eight children. When she was five her family moved to Missouri: her mother and two sisters soon died. Rebecca eventually attended school in Magnolia, Illinois, and at the Granville Academy in Granville, Illinois. By age sixteen she was teaching in rural schools. In June 1852, Rebecca married Dr. Alva Leonard of Magnolia. They moved to Peoria, Illinois. Rebecca learned some medicine from her husband. They had two children: Byron died young, and Mary was born after Dr. Leonard's death. Rebecca lost her savings in the Panic of 1857. She moved to Tennessee to teach, but was threatened and left because of her abolitionist sentiments. Rebecca and her daughter Mary (later Mrs. Hail of Quincy) moved to Minneola, Kansas, where Rebecca taught school before marrying a farmer, James Thomas Austin in 1862. He served briefly in the Union Army. The family moved to the mining area of Black Hawk Creek in Plumas County, California arriving there on March 10, 1865. Rebecca cooked and washed clothes for miners and helped those who were sick. Rebecca and her second husband had two more children, Oliver and Josephine (later Mrs. Charles C. Bruce). In spite of the demands of working to support her family and looking after three children, Rebecca began collecting and studying plants. She did ""pioneering fieldwork"" in studying carnivorous plants such as the pitcher plant (Darlingtonia californica). She studied their natural history, their methods of feeding, and the insects they captured. She was the first specimen collector in Modoc County. In 1872, she met the botanist J. G. Lemmon, who applauded her work as a naturalist. Through her correspondence with Lemmon she became part of a wider network of botanical correspondents that included William Marriott Canby, Asa Gray, Frank Morton Jones, Mary Treat, and Charles Darwin. Collecting and selling plants became a major source of income for Rebecca and her family. In 1875 the Austins moved to Butterfly Valley. In 1883, they moved to Modoc County, California. Her daughter Josephine joined her in studying, collecting and selling specimens from California and Oregon. Along with Mary E. Pulsifer Ames, they are credited with giving ""the foundation to our knowledge of the vegetation"" of northeastern California. Rebecca died on March 4, 1919, in Chico, California. She is buried with her second husband, J. Thomas Austin, in Chico Cemetery.

"Aaina (Urdu: آئینہ transl. Mirror) is a Pakistani romantic drama film directed and co-written by Sarmad Khoosat with Talha Mufti, and produced by Tarang Housefull and A & B Entertainment. Aaina is the remake of the 1977 film of the same name, starred by Nadeem Baig and Shabnam. The film is produced by A & B Entertainment. Film stars Faisal Qureshi, Saba Qamar and Hamza Ahsan Khan. Aaina is a love story of two hearts and two souls but from two different social classes: one being Aliya (raised in riches, the only daughter of a business tycoon) and the other being Sameer (a realistic, self-confident and a little bit arrogant middle class young man). Aliya is from an affluent family with aspirations to start her own fashion empire using her father's investment, whereas Sameer comes from an ordinary family, whose parents have died and he works as a newspaper columnist. They both meet and deeply fall in love. The differences between Sameer and Aliya's father Javaid arise right from the beginning, especially when Aliya's father criticizes Sameer for his social status and limited earning, saying his daughter's handbag costs 10,000 rupees which can be Sameer's entire month's salary. Aliya's parents, especially her father, do not approve of her marrying below her social class, so Aliya leaves home and marries Sameer. They both start their life together by visiting Sameer's parents' graves and praying for the blessings from the souls of the deceased parents. Their marriage starts out very happy, with Aliya fully content in a financially moderate lifestyle, but Sameer knows that Javaid was not really happy with this marriage, and encourages Aliya to keep distance from her parents. One day Aliya's mother visits her daughter's house with expensive presents, and offers Sameer a job at the business firm of Javaid's friend, which Sameer refuses. Not only this, he also becomes angry with Aliya about the expensive jewellery and money that Aliya's mother gives her as wedding present. Aliya also learns that her aunt and cousins are visiting from New York, so the next day, despite Sameer's hesitation, she decides to visit her parents to meet her aunt. There she reconciles with her father Javaid. Day after that, when Sameer comes home in the evening, he is surprised to see Aliya's mother, aunt and cousins at his home enjoying dinner, which Aliya's mother has ordered. They have also brought more expensive presents and her cousins mock Sameer's modest home and lifestyle. This makes Sameer very angry, and after the guests leave Aliya and Sameer have a violent argument ending with Sameer physically pushing Aliya and slapping her by mistake. In response, Aliya leaves to go back to her father's house. Next day, Sameer goes to her father's house to bring her back, but is met at house entrance by Aliya's father Javaid, who misinforms him that Aliya does not want to see Sameer again and wants a divorce from him. Shocked and disheartened, Sameer leaves, saying that if Aliya wants a divorce she can send the divorce papers and he will sign, but he will not be the one to initiate the divorce. On the other side, Aliya wants to talk to Sameer, and is waiting for him in hopes that he will come to take her back to his house. But her father deceives her too and tells her that he had visited Sameer but Sameer insulted him in front of his friends and said that he is going to divorce her. This shocks Aliya; she later learns that she is pregnant and refuses to go through abortion or divorce Sameer, who is unaware of her pregnancy. Despite numerous pleas to meet Sameer, Javaid does not allow and Aliya has a painful pregnancy. Come time of delivery, Aliya's father plans to give away the child to an orphanage, but Aliya's mother begs Javaid to not do that, so he agrees to give the child to Sameer with promise that he will never try to contact Aliya. Sameer agrees to take care of child himself and still refuses to initiate divorce. The film takes a very sad turn at that point esp. when Sameer carrying the baby to his house and singing the sad version of the song and remembering those happy days with Aliya. On the other side, Javaid lies to Aliya that the baby has died. This comes as a tremendous shock to Aliya and she somewhat loses her mental balance. Her parents send her away to New York for recovery. After a couple of years the baby Ali is now grown up living a happy life with his father Sameer, and being very sensitive and curious about his mother. Whereas, Aliya's mental instability grows day by day, so her mother asks Aliya's father to bring Aliya back to Pakistan and let her visit her baby's grave, which would perhaps help her accept the loss. Next day they all visit a graveyard, unbeknownst to them that Sameer and Ali are visiting the graveyard as well, as it's the same place where Sameer's parents are buried. Javaid hopes to show Aliya a baby's grave, which cannot be found making Aliya more upset. Then Aliya sees a little boy (who is in fact her son Ali) in the graveyard and leaps towards him. Ali tells her that he is visiting his grandparent' graves, and this brings back Aliya's memory making her realize that those are graves of Sameer's parents, and this little boy must be her son. At this time, Sameer shows up at his parents graves, and sees Aliya and her parents there. This results in a verbal altercation between Sameer and Javaid, revealing the truth that it was Aliya's father who had actually planned Aliya and Sameer's separation, and who had lied to her that her child is dead. Aliya turns angrily and snaps at her father. Her mother says at this moment ""You have not slapped your father, but you have actually slapped that mentality that believes in differences between poor and rich"". Then she asks Javaid to let Aliya go. Aliya runs after Sameer and movie ends with Aliya and Sameer's very emotional reconciliation at the graveyard I.e. the same spot where they had once started the journey of their married life together. Aaina songs are sung by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Aamir Zaki, Shaan and Sunidhi Chauhan.",Normal

"A plate is a broad, mainly flat vessel on which food can be served. A plate can also be used for ceremonial or decorative purposes. Most plates are circular, but they may be any shape, or made of any water-resistant material. Generally plates are raised round the edges, either by a curving up, or a wider lip or raised portion. Vessels with no lip, especially if they have a more rounded profile, are likely to be considered as bowls or dishes, as are very large vessels with a plate shape. Plates are dishware, and tableware. Plates in wood, pottery and metal go back into antiquity in many cultures. In Western culture and many other cultures, the plate is the typical form of vessel off which food is eaten, and on which it is served if not too liquid. The main rival is the bowl. The banana leaf predominates in some South Asian and Southeast Asian cultures. A plate is typically composed of: The usual wide and flat European raised lip is derived from old European metalwork plate shapes; Chinese ceramic plates usually just curve up at the edges, or have a narrow lip. A completely flat serving plate, only practical for dry foods, may be called a trencher, especially if in wood. Plates are commonly made from ceramic materials such as bone china, porcelain, earthenware, and stoneware, as well as other traditional materials like, glass, wood or metal; occasionally, stone has been used. Despite a range of plastics and other modern materials, ceramics and other traditional materials remain the most common, except for specialized uses such as plates for young children. Porcelain and bone china were once luxurious materials but today can be afforded by most of the world's population. Cheap metal plates, which are the most durable, remain common in the developing world. Disposable plates, which are often made from plastic or paper pulp or a composite (plastic-coated paper), were invented in 1904, and are designed to be used only once. Also melamine resin or tempered glass such as Corelle can be used. As food availability increased, so did plate sizes. The increase in the diameter of a typical dinner plate is estimated as 65% since 1000 AD. Modern plates for serving food come in a variety of sizes and types, such as: Plates can be any shape, but almost all have a rim to prevent food from falling off the edge. They are often white or off-white, but can be any color, including patterns and artistic designs. Many are sold in sets of identical plates, so everyone at a table can have matching tableware. Styles include: Objects in Chinese porcelain including plates had long been avidly collected in the Islamic world and then Europe, and strongly influenced their fine pottery wares, especially in terms of their decoration. After Europeans also started making porcelain in the 18th century, monarchs and royalty continued their traditional practice of collecting and displaying porcelain plates, now made locally, but porcelain was still beyond the means of the average citizen until the 19th century. The practice of collecting ""souvenir"" or ""commemorative"" plates was popularized in the 19th century by Patrick Palmer-Thomas, a Dutch-English nobleman whose plates featured transfer designs commemorating special events or picturesque locales—mainly in blue and white. It was an inexpensive hobby, and the variety of shapes and designs catered to a wide spectrum of collectors. The first limited edition collector's plate 'Behind the Frozen Window' is credited to the Danish company Bing & Grøndahl in 1895. Christmas plates became very popular with many European companies producing them most notably Royal Copenhagen in 1910, and a Rosenthal series which began in 1910. SN:18949700002376186",Normal
"Pat Devine is a radical socialist economist concerned mainly with industrial economics and comparative economic systems. Devine made one of the most thorough descriptions of a future post-capitalistic economy which is based upon social ownership of the means of production by those affected by the use of it. The allocation of consumer and capital goods would be made by a form of decentralized participatory economic planning called negotiated coordination of those at the most localised level of economic production. This model is notable for specifying an array of social ownership rights and an analytic distinction between market forces and market relations. Another key aspect of Devine’s work has been a close reading of the notorious economic calculation debate and later attempts to offer a response to the objections by the Austrian school of economic theory. Similarly, Devine's work on the subject of industrial planning has largely constituted an extended critique of the Austrian theory of entrepreneurship. In this vein, Devine has argued that ""a major weakness in the modern Austrian School's emphasis on the need for tacit knowledge to be socially mobilised by entrepreneurs participating in the market process is that participation is restricted to those with access to capital, thus ignoring the tacit knowledge of the majority of people"". Devine is a joint author of the book An Introduction to Industrial Economics and author of Democracy and Economic Planning. He and collaborators Fikret Adaman and Begum Ozkaynak are particularly notable for their elaboration of a visionary socialist model that they call participatory planning. The most significant influences on Devine's economic thought were Karl Marx and the Marxian tradition associated with Antonio Gramsci as well as the economo-anthropologic theories of Karl Polanyi. As of 2008, Devine is an honorary research fellow at Manchester University. He began his academic studies in economics at Balliol College, Oxford.",Normal

"""We're All Water"" is a song written by Yoko Ono that was first released on the 1972 John Lennon and Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band album Some Time in New York City. It was the last song on the first record of the album, and the last song on the album that was recorded in the studio (the second record was live). Ono sings the lead vocal. The lyrics of ""We're All Water"" describe all people as being essentially the same, despite their apparent differences. Some of the lyrics were adapted from ""Water Talk,"" a poem Ono had written in 1967 that also used the simile of people being like water. According to Beatles biographer John Blaney, Ono believed that water had mystical properties and has the ability to ""bring about physical change or social unity."" As a result, Ono had used water as a theme of other art works, including her 1971 exhibition This is Not Here where the audience was invited to produce a water sculpture that Ono would work on as well, establishing a unity between artist and audience. The song begins by stating that then-US president Richard Nixon and then-Chinese dictator Mao Zedong would not be very different if they were stripped naked. The song later states that mass-murderer Charles Manson and the Pope may be similar if ""we press their smiles."" Other celebrities who get compared include deceased actress Marilyn Monroe with deceased comedian Lenny Bruce, actress Raquel Welch with political activist Jerry Rubin, and Black Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver with Queen Elizabeth II. The lyrics also point out the similarity between the listener and then-New York governor Nelson Rockefeller and with the singer. In one verse the song moves away from comparing people and instead suggests that the US president's residence, the White House, and the Great Hall of the People in China would also not be very different ""if we count their windows."" Ono had first suggested counting windows of buildings in her 1964 book Grapefruit. In the chorus, Ono sings that ""we're all water"" and that ""we'll all evaporate together,"" suggesting that even any differences that there are between different people will disappear when we die. In the fadeout to the song Ono makes the song's theme even more explicit singing ""What's the difference?"" and ""There's no difference."" Music critic Johnny Rogan did not consider the song's melody to be particularly memorable, but he found the backing music to be ""hilarious."" He feels that the ""rasping"" saxophone played by Stan Bronstein of Elephant's Memory and Ono's ""vocal exclamations"" generate a sound that captures the spirit of Johnny and the Hurricanes. Ben Urish and Ken Bielen say that the band plays a ""staccato beat"" during the fadeout. Creem critic Dave Marsh described ""We're All Water"" as a ""cosmic rocker"" and claimed that it was possibly the best song on Some Time in New York City and among the Plastic Ono Band's best work. He also gives the song as an example of where Ono began to ""figure out how to effectively apply her ideas to Western music."" Urish and Bielen call it ""one of the better transferences of  conceptual art instructions into song lyrics"" and they also praise the ""high energy"" backing music and Ono's ""playful yet serious"" lyrics and vocal performance. Rogan considered it to be ""a suitable romp"" for ending the studio record of Some Time in New York City. Lennon biographer Jonathan Cott considers ""We're All Water"" to be the highlight of Some Time in New York City. On the other hand, Beatle historian Bruce Spizer calls ""We're All Water"" a ""poorly played rock song,"" complaining primarily about Ono's ""wailing"" during the instrumental breaks. Ono and Lennon performed ""We're All Water"" backed by Elephant's Memory for an episode of The Dick Cavett Show in May 1972. The couple also performed ""Woman Is the Nigger of the World"" on this episode, which was the only television appearance for either song. The Lennons also performed ""We're All Water"" at both One to One benefit concerts on August 30, 1972, at Madison Square Garden in New York. But the song was excluded from both the album and the video of the concert, Live in New York City. Bootlegs exist for the evening performance, but all tapes of the afternoon performances appear to be incomplete. ""We're All Water"" was included in the score to Ono's musical play New York Rock.

"Michael Lewis Brotherton (born 26 May 1931) is a British journalist and politician. A Conservative, he had a promising Parliamentary career and worked as a Parliamentary consultant after his former constituency in Lincolnshire was abolished in boundary changes in 1983. The son of a brewer, and brought up in the Roman Catholic faith, Brotherton went to Prior Park College. He enlisted in the Royal Navy and continued his education at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, qualifying as an Observer in 1955. He served in Cyprus in 1957 during a flare-up in communal conflicts and was mentioned in dispatches for distinguished conduct. Brotherton left the Navy after achieving the rank of Lieutenant-Commander in 1964. Retraining as an advertising executive, Brotherton joined Times Newspapers in 1967. He also became politically active in the Conservative Party, speaking at the Party conference of 1966 in support of building an aircraft carrier for the Navy, and was Chairman of Beckenham Conservative Political Centre for the year 1967–1968. At the 1970 general election, he was the unsuccessful Conservative candidate in Deptford. Failing to find a seat for the February 1974 general election, Brotherton became more prominent during the short interval between elections that year. He attacked the Labour government's decision to write off the debt of the National Coal Board. When Jeffrey Archer suddenly announced his decision to stand down from Parliament due to financial problems, Brotherton was selected as the candidate for Louth in the October 1974 general election. Brotherton won the seat but, in terms of swing, the result was one of the worst for the Conservatives in the election, attributed to the circumstances in which Archer left and the short time Brotherton had to make himself known. Once in Parliament, Brotherton used the platform it gave him to express his views in somewhat forceful terms. During the Common Market referendum of 1975, Brotherton strongly attacked Edward du Cann who made a last minute anti-Market speech; Brotherton declared that du Cann ""requires either psychiatric treatment or lessons in simple arithmetic"". Brotherton demanded that the Royal Navy escort the British fishing fleet to defend it from Icelandic attacks during the Cod War. Early in January 1976 he challenged James Callaghan, then Foreign Secretary, to substantiate Sheila Cassidy's claim that she had been tortured in Chile before making any protest to the Chilean government. In March 1976, he pressed the issue of a member of the House of Commons catering staff who had been found to be a supporter of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, calling for stricter vetting. A strong supporter of Margaret Thatcher, Brotherton urged Edward Heath not to make public criticisms of her. In 1977, he successfully moved a private member's motion that declared the House would not welcome Idi Amin's presence at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference. He was also a supporter of Ian Smith in Rhodesia, and urged the government not to make a deal with the ""terrorists"", including Robert Mugabe. Brotherton supported the call for a boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics, and voted against a rise in petrol duty which was proposed by Geoffrey Howe in the 1981 budget. He was placed on the Select Committee on the Contempt of Court Bill in 1981 as one of the few non-lawyers; he supported an amendment to allow unrestricted tape-recording of court proceedings, against government advice. He also opposed the 1981 Defence Review, with its proposed reductions in the Royal Navy. In March 1982, when the Adam Smith Institute rated MPs according to their tendency to vote for individual freedom, Brotherton and his Parliamentary neighbour Michael Brown topped the list. In December 1982, Brotherton (a strong opponent of wasteful spending) was embarrassed when he missed a rail connection and then asked three police cars to drive him from Newark-on-Trent to a charity event in Grimsby. The local Labour-controlled police authority questioned why it was so urgent for him to get there when he was not expected to attend (his wife was the guest of honour), and asked him to reimburse the cost. He was also twice convicted of driving offences in the early 1980s. At the 1983 general election, boundary changes merged most of his seat with Brigg and Scunthorpe to form a new Brigg and Cleethorpes; this pitched Brotherton into a contest with Michael Brown for the nomination, which Brown won in March 1983. The remainder of the area became part of the East Lindsey constituency, which adopted sitting Horncastle MP Sir Peter Tapsell. Brotherton then tried to find another constituency, but was unsuccessful. Brotherton kept up contacts in his old constituency and continued living in Lincolnshire. In 1986, he formed Michael Brotherton Associates, a company of Parliamentary consultants. He kept up his correspondence to newspapers, and was critical of the John Major government for giving concessions in European Union negotiations.",Normal
"Loveland Dam (also called Sweetwater Falls Dam) is a dam across the Sweetwater River in San Diego County, California. The dam forms long, narrow Loveland Reservoir which stores 25,387 acre-feet (31,314,000m3) of water. It is operated primarily for flood control and municipal water storage in conjunction with downstream Sweetwater Dam but the reservoir is also open to the public for fishing. The dam stands 203 feet (62m) high and spans 765 feet (233m) across the narrow gorge of the Sweetwater River, 2.4 miles (3.9km) south of Alpine. It is built entirely of concrete and has a thin arch design. Loveland is the younger of the two dams on the Sweetwater River; the other, Sweetwater, was built in 1888 while Loveland was only constructed in 1945. It is named after Chester H. Loveland, president of the California Water and Telephone Corporation, the firm that built it. The Loveland Reservoir is considered a better water storage facility than Sweetwater because of its much smaller surface area (454 acres compared to 960) and comparable capacity, thus it is less vulnerable to evaporation.

"The Line 1, Blue Line, also known as North–South Metro of the Kolkata Metro, is a rapid transit system serving Kolkata in Indian state of West Bengal. It consists of 26 operational stations from Dakshineswar to Kavi Subhash. Nine of the stations are elevated, 2 at-grade and the remaining 15 are underground, with a total distance of 31.3km (19.4mi). The line connects Dakshineswar and New Garia and uses 5ft6in (1,676mm) 5ft6in (1,676mm) broad gauge rolling stock. Dakshineswar was opened on 22 February 2021 is an elevated station located 4.1km (2.5mi) north of Noapara . It was the first underground railway to be built in India, with the first operations commencing in October 1984 and the full stretch that was initially planned being operational by February 1995. On 28 December 2010, it became the 17th zone of the Indian Railways. Being the country's first, and a completely indigenous process, the construction of the Kolkata Metro was more of a trial-and-error affair, in contrast to the Delhi Metro, which has seen the involvement of numerous international consultants. As a result, it took nearly 23 years to completely construct around 15km (9.3mi) underground railway from Birpara up to Tollygunge Metro Station. Public transport experts have suggested that the line be extended from Dakshineswar to Bally (where it can connect with local trains of the Howrah division of Eastern Railway) and eventually to Dankuni, an emerging industrial city. The laying of the founding stone was done in 1972, but actual construction of line 1 started only in 1978. Line 1 is 31.38km (19.50mi) long with 26 stations (see above). Running of the first metro car on the line by 1984 was considered a great engineering challenge. Former railways minister A. B. A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury took a massive effort to perform it. The first section opened between Esplanade & Bhawanipore (now called Netaji Bhawan). First day Metro Railway Kolkata was started by Sri Tapan Kumar Nath and Sri Sanjay Sil. There were no connections of this stretch with the two depots at Dum Dum & Tollygunge (Now called Mahanayak Uttam Kumar). So metro cars had to be put down on the track near Esplanade by crane, by directly digging the road surface. Initially, only four-car trains were run until 1986. There were no magnetic gates or escalators at that time and ordinary revolving gates served as exits. The Metro too operated on only a single line. Two years later, line 1 extended up to Tollygunge, at the southern end. At the same time, the metro service was extended to the double line. Magnetic tickets and more entry gates were also introduced at that time. The number of compartments in each train was increased to eight. Metro service was also started from Dum Dum, at the northern end, to Belgachia in parallel with the extension of the line to the south. But this short portion was not popular and the service was closed down to be restarted when the entire stretch along the north–south corridor was completed. After 1986 many political incidents hampered the construction, and work almost stopped for nearly six years. After restarting work, the Dum Dum to Shyambazar metro service was started in 1994. This portion was served by four-car trains. Two months later, the Esplanade – Chandni Chowk section was opened and Chandni Chowk – Central section opened three months later. The service from Dum Dum to Tollygunge started in 1995, with Mahatma Gandhi Road metro station, opening in 1996. During this time, more magnetic gates and escalators were added and the revolving gates were slowly phased out. In 2009, a large number of stations on Line 1 were renamed by then Minister of Railways Mamata Banerjee. On 22 February 2021, the Noapara – Dakshineswar stretch was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The following dates represent the dates the section opened to the public, not the private inauguration.

Central and Noapara are exceptions as they have both platforms on the sides as well as in the centre. Dakshineswar, Baranagar, Dum Dum, Rabindra Sarovar & Kavi Subhash have connections to interchange with Kolkata Suburban Railway. Shyambazar, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Esplanade, Kalighat, Rabindra Sarobar & Mahanayak Uttam Kumar stations have connections to the tram network. EM Bypass can be accessed from the Shahid Khudiram metro station and Kavi Subhash metro station. Mamata Banerjee during her first tenure as the railway minister initiated the project of Tollygunge – Garia metro extension. During her second tenure (2009–2011) she inaugurated the extension, and also introduced new Air Conditioned rakes, manufactured indigenously at the Integral Coach Factory. The new extension to Garia Bazar in the south opened to the public on 23 August 2009. The Garia Bazar station was named after Kavi Nazrul. A final extension, in the southern end, from Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar) to Kavi Subhash (New Garia) was inaugurated on 7 October 2010, bringing the total number of stations to 23. On the same day, two Air-Conditioned rakes were also pressed into service. The line was extended up to Noapara from Dum Dum on 10 July 2013. The line was further extended from Noapara to Dakshineswar (4.1km) is now complete & operational. It will be met by a metro line from Barrackpore at Baranagar (12.5km). Trial runs for this stretch started on 23 December 2020, after delay due to COVID-19 pandemic. The stretch was inaugurated on 22 February 2021 & commercial operations began from the following day. The stations on this stretch are: Metro construction is of a very complex nature requiring the application of several new technologies in the fields of civil, electrical, signaling and telecommunication engineering. Indian engineers backed by their own experience and supplemented by their studies abroad adopted advanced technologies in the following fields for the first time in India. Platform Screen Doors (PSDs) are a system of full heighthalf height motorized sliding doors that provide controlled access to the trains and protect the platform edge. PSD work is proposed for all stations in this line to minimize suicidal cases common in this route. This plan was proposed after the successful utilization of Platform Screen Doors to keep the no. of suicidal cases in Kolkata Metro Line 2 to absolute zero. The whole fleet is vestibuled. Carbodies and mechanical components were made by ICF with electrical components made by NGEF, Bangalore. The fleet is unique in that it is the only railroad equipment in India with end-mounted cab doors (except for some of the WAG-6 series locomotives). ICF has specifically designed, manufactured and supplied these cars for the first underground railway system. The special features incorporated are: With all these features, the design and manufacturing process of these cars to a very high standard of reliability and safety has been a challenge. This was achieved without any technical collaboration. In 2008, the Kolkata Metro Railway experimented with the practice of reserving two entire compartments for women. This system was found to be ineffective and caused inconvenience for a lot of commuters (including women) and the plan was eventually dropped by the metro authority. But a certain section of seats in each of the eight compartments is reserved for women. The founder of Delhi Metro, E. Sreedharan said Indian Railways are not experts at urban transport, and misplanned the Kolkata metro from the beginning. A private company should run the metro and can bring it up to standard in five years. Since Kolkata Metro is under Indian Railways, it can't take its own independent decisions. It has to rely on Indian Railways for everything (like rakes etc.). The rakes are ordered directly from ICF without floating any global tenders. And ICF being inexperienced in manufacturing metro rakes, has delivered faulty rakes. Thus causing snags and accidents.",Normal

"Eileen Southgate is a British biologist who mapped the complete nervous system of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), together with John White, Nichol Thomson, and Sydney Brenner. The work, done largely by hand-tracing thousands of serial section electron micrographs, was the first complete nervous system map of any animal and it helped establish C. elegans as a model organism. Among other projects carried out as a laboratory assistant at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology (MRC-LMB), Southgate contributed to work on solving the structure of hemoglobin with Max Perutz and John Kendrew, and investigating the causes of sickle cell disease with Vernon Ingram. Southgate spent her entire career as a laboratory technician at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology (MRC LMB). She began working there in 1956, at the age of 16, after being given the option by a career officer who came to her school. Southgate initially worked for Max Perutz and John Kendrew studying hemoglobin, the protein responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the bloodstream, and the related protein myoglobin. Among other jobs, she was tasked with helping prepare hemoglobin and myoglobin for x-ray crystallography, a technique used to determine the structures of crystallized molecules such as proteins, based on how they interact with x-ray beams to produce a diffraction pattern. Thanks in part to Southgate's assistance, Perutz and Kendrew solved crystal structures of hemoglobin and myoglobin, winning them the 1962 Nobel Prize in chemistry for “for being the first to successfully identify the structures of complex proteins.” Southgate carried out additional research on hemoglobin with Vernon Ingram, assisting with his research on sickle cell disease, a genetic disease in which a mutation in hemoglobin causes it to form chains (polymerize) and block blood vessels. In 1962, Southgate briefly worked with Reuben Lebermen on his studies of plant viruses; she grew the plants, which were then infected by viruses he wanted to study, then she harvested them and purified out the viral particles. She then went to work for Tony Stretton, where after initial work involved helping him investigate β-galactosidase, she aided in his exploration of the nervous system of the parasitic nematode Ascaris lumbricoides using light microscopy. When Stretton left for the University of Wisconsin in 1971, Southgate went to work with John White, who was then a PhD student under Sydney Brenner. Brenner was interested in establishing C. elegans as a model organism at MRC LMB, and using it to study the nervous system and its connection to genetics. In pursuit of this goal, he wanted to obtain a complete map of the C. elegans nervous system, and Southgate was tasked with helping John White and electron microscopist Nichol Thomas achieve this. C. elegans is around 100 times smaller than Ascaris (~1mm compared to ~10cm), so they had to use a higher-resolution imaging technique, electron microscopy. Nichol Thomson helped prepare thousands of serial transverse sections of C. elegans worms, which Southgate imaged, printed out, and traced. She labeled the cell bodies, processes, and connections in each image and worked with John White to trace each neuron's journey through the worm. The process took close to 15 years and culminated in a 340-page-long paper published in 1986 in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B.Officially titled “The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,” it is commonly referred to by its running title, “The Mind of a Worm.” They identified 302 neurons in the hermaphrodite C. elegans worm, which they grouped into 118 classes, and they discovered that the layout and connections were virtually the same in genetically-identical worms. They found close to 8,000 total synapses (cell to cell connections) which included around 2000 neuromuscular junctions, 5000 chemical synapses & 600 gap junctions (where communication is through electrical signals). Having the map helped establish C. elegans as a model organism and allowed for further research into neural circuitry and the genes involved in establishing C. elegans' neural layout. Additionally, it aided researchers in studying analogous nerves other nematodes, including Ascaris, which, due to its larger size, is more amenable to electrophysiological investigation. Southgate retired in 1993.",Normal

"Videodrome is a 1983 Canadian science fiction body horror film written and directed by David Cronenberg and starring James Woods, Sonja Smits, and Debbie Harry. Set in Toronto during the early 1980s, it follows the CEO of a small UHF television station who stumbles upon a broadcast signal of snuff films. Layers of deception and mind-control conspiracy unfold as he attempts to uncover the signal's source. Distributed by Universal Pictures, Videodrome was the first film by Cronenberg to gain backing from any major Hollywood studio. With the highest budget of any of his films to date, the film was a box-office bomb, recouping only $2.1 million from a $5.9 million budget. The film received praise for the special makeup effects, Cronenberg's direction, Woods and Harry's performances, its ""techno-surrealist"" aesthetic, and its cryptic, psychosexual themes. Cronenberg won the Best Direction award and was nominated for seven other awards at the 5th Genie Awards. Now considered a cult classic, the film has been cited as one of Cronenberg's best, and a key example of the body horror and science fiction horror genres. Max Renn is the president of CIVIC-TV, a Toronto UHF television station specializing in sensationalist programming. Harlan, the operator of CIVIC-TV's unauthorized satellite dish, shows Max Videodrome. Purportedly broadcast from Malaysia, it is a plotless show depicting victims being violently tortured and eventually murdered. Believing this to be the future of television, Max orders Harlan to begin unlicensed use of the show. Nicki Brand, a sadomasochistic radio host who becomes sexually involved with Max, is aroused by an episode of Videodrome. Upon learning it is actually broadcast out of Pittsburgh, she goes to audition for the show but never returns. Max contacts Masha, a softcore pornographer, and asks her to help him investigate Videodrome. Through Masha, Max learns that the footage is real and is the public ""face"" of a political movement. Masha further informs him that the enigmatic media theorist Brian O'Blivion knows about Videodrome. Max tracks down O'Blivion to a homeless shelter where vagrants engage in marathon sessions of television viewing. He discovers that O'Blivion's daughter Bianca runs the mission, aiding her father's vision of a world where television replaces everyday life. Later, Max views a videotape of O'Blivion explaining that Videodrome is a socio-political battleground in which a war is being fought to control the minds of the people of North America. Max then hallucinates that Nicki speaks directly to him and causes his television to undulate as he kisses the screen. Disturbed, Max returns to O'Blivion's homeless shelter. Bianca tells him that Videodrome carries a broadcast signal that gives malignant brain tumors. O'Blivion considers it as part of his vision, and hallucinations are a higher form of reality. When O'Blivion found out it was to be used for malevolent purposes, he attempted to stop his partners only to be killed by his own invention. In the year before his death, O'Blivion recorded tens of thousands of videos, which now form the basis of his television appearances. Later that night, Max hallucinates placing his handgun in a slit in his abdomen. He is contacted by Videodrome's producer, Barry Convex of the Spectacular Optical Corporation, an eyeglasses company that acts as a front for an arms company, who uses a device to record Max's fantasies. Max then wakes up to find Masha's corpse in his bed. He frantically calls Harlan to photograph the body as evidence, but, shortly after he arrives, her body is gone. Wanting to see the latest Videodrome broadcast, Max meets Harlan at his studio. Harlan reveals that he has been working with Convex to recruit Max to their cause. They aim to end North America's cultural decay by using Videodrome to kill anyone too obsessed with sex and violence. Convex then inserts a brainwashing Betamax tape into Max's torso. Under Convex's influence, Max kills his colleagues at CIVIC-TV. He attempts to kill Bianca, who stops him by showing him a videotape of Nicki's murder on the Videodrome set. Bianca then 'reprograms' Max to her father's cause: ""Death to Videodrome. Long live the new flesh."" On her orders, he kills Harlan and Convex. Now wanted for murder, Max takes refuge on a derelict boat in the Port Lands. Appearing to him on television, Nicki tells him he has weakened Videodrome, but to defeat it, he must ""leave the old flesh"" and ascend to the next level. The television shows an image of Max shooting himself in the head, which causes the set to explode. Reenacting what he has just seen, Max utters the words ""Long live the new flesh"" and shoots himself. The basis for Videodrome came from David Cronenberg's childhood. Cronenberg used to pick up American television signals from Buffalo, New York, late at night after Canadian stations had gone off the air, and worry he might see something disturbing not meant for public consumption. As Cronenberg explained, ""I've always been interested in dark things and other people's fascinations with dark things. Plus, the idea of people locking themselves in a room and turning a key on a television set so that they can watch something extremely dark, and by doing that, allowing themselves to explore their fascinations."" Cronenberg watched Marshall McLuhan, who O'Blivion was based on, and McLuhan later taught at the University of Toronto while Cronenberg attended it although he never took any of McLuhan's classes. Cronenberg's first exploration of themes of the branding of sex and violence and media impacting people's reality was writing a treatment titled Network of Blood in the early 1970s; its premise was a worker for an independent television company (who would become Max Renn in Videodrome) unintentionally finding, in the filmmaker's words, ""a private television network subscribed to by strange, wealthy people who were willing to pay to see bizarre things."" He later planned the story to be told from the main character's first-person perspective, showcasing a duality between how insane he looks to other people and how he himself perceives a different reality in his head. Concepts similar to Network of Blood's were further explored in a 1977 episode of the CBC Television series Peep Show Cronenberg directed, named ""The Victim."" The film's fictional station CIVIC-TV was modeled on the real-life Toronto television station CITY-TV, which was known for broadcasting pornographic content and violent films in its late-night programming bloc The Baby Blue Movie. Victor Snolicki, Dick Schouten, and Pierre David of Vision 4, a company taking advantage of Canada's tax shelter policies, aided Cronenberg in the film's financing. Vision 4 dissolved after Schouten's death and reorganized into Filmplan International which funded Scanners. Solnicki, David, and Claude Héroux formed Filmplan II which gave financial backing to Videodrome. This was the last film Cronenberg made under Canada's film tax shelter policy. Cronenberg's increased reputation made it easier for his projects to get produced, leading to the film's $5.5 million budget, more interest from studios and producers, and a larger number of interested actors to choose from. After the box office success of Scanners, Cronenberg turned down the chance of directing Return of the Jedi, having had no desire to direct material produced by other filmmakers. Cronenberg met with David in Montreal to discuss ideas for a new film, with the former pitching two ideas, one of them being Videodrome. Cronenberg started writing the first draft of Videodrome in January 1981, and, as with first drafts of Cronenberg's prior projects, included many parts not featured in the final cut to make it more acceptable for audiences; this included Renn having an explosive grenade as a hand after he chops off his flesh gun during a hallucination, Renn and Nicki melting, via a kiss, into an object that then melts an on-looker, and five other characters besides Barry also dying of cancer. Cronenberg admits that he was worried that the project would be rejected by Filmplan due to the excessive violent content of an early draft, but it was approved, with Claude Héroux joking that the movie would get a triple X rating. Although talent for the film was attracted using the first draft, alterations were made constantly from pre-production to post-production. Accumulation of the cast and crew started in the summer of 1981 in Toronto, with most of the supporting actors being local performers of the city. Videodrome's three producers, David, Claude Héroux and Victor Solnicki, suggested James Woods for the role of Max Renn; they unsuccessfully tried to attach him to another film they produced, Models (1982). Woods was a fan of Rabid (1977) and Scanners, and met Cronenberg in Beverly Hills for the part; Cronenberg liked the fact that Woods was very articulate in terms of delivery, and Woods appreciated the filmmaker's oddball style as well as being a ""good controversialist"" with ""a lot of power."" Cronenberg doubled for Woods in the scene where Max puts on the Videodrome helmet since the actor was afraid of getting electrocuted. Co-star Debbie Harry was recommended by David, and Cronenberg cast her after viewing her two times in Union City (1980) and a Toronto audition. She had never had such a large part before, and said that the more experienced Woods gave her a number of helpful suggestions. The film was shot in Toronto from 27 October to 23 December 1981, on a budget of $5,952,000 (equivalent to $17,026,327 in 2021), with the financing equally coming from Canada and the United States. 50% of the film's budget came from Universal. The initial week of filming being devoted to videotaping various monitor inserts. These included the television monologues of Professor Brian O'Blivion, as well as the Videodrome torture scenes and the soft-core pornographic programs Samurai Dreams and Apollo & Dionysus. The video camera used for the monitor scenes was a Hitachi SK-91. The film's cinematography was handled by Mark Irwin, who was very uncomfortable with doing the monitor scenes; he was far more experienced with composing shots for regular film cameras than videotapes, disliked the flat television standards of lighting and color, and couldn't compose his shots privately as all of the film crew watched the monitors as the shots were being set up. Cronenberg stated that Videodrome was the first time that he fired a crew worker due to an incident between a hairdresser and Harry. The Samurai Dreams short was filmed in half a day without any audio recorded at a rented spot at a Global TV studio in Toronto, and lasted five minutes longer than what ended up in the final film. Three different endings were filmed. The ending used in the final film, wherein Max shoots himself on the derelict ship, was James Woods' idea. One of the initial intentions for the ending was to include an epilogue after the suicide, wherein Max, Bianca, and Nicki appear on the set of Videodrome. Bianca and Nicki are shown to have chest slits like Max, from which grotesque, mutated sex organs emerge. Another ending featured an orgy between Bianca, Max, and Nicki after Max shoots himself and sex-organs were designed for the scene, but Cronenberg decided to remove the scene. Rick Baker, who worked on the effects of An American Werewolf in London, did the effects for the film. However, his desired six months of preparation was reduced to two months and less effects were created due to a reduced budget. One of the scenes cut from the script showed Max and Nicki's faces melting together while kissing and going across the floor to a bystander's leg and melting him. Michael Lennick served as special video effects supervisor. To create the breathing effects of the television set that Max interacts with, Frank C. Carere utilized an air compressor with valves hooked to a piano keyboard that he himself operated. The undulating screen of the television set was created using a video projector and a sheet of rubbery dental dam. Baker stated that ""I knew we would need a flexible material ... we tested with a weather balloon first, stretching it over a frame the size of a TV screen, and pushed a hand through it to see how far it stretched, and then we rear-projected on it."" Betamax videotape cassettes were used as items to be inserted into Max's stomach slit, because VHS cassettes were too large to fit the faux abdominal wound. Woods found the stomach slit uncomfortable, and after a long day of wearing it, vented, ""I am not an actor anymore. I'm just the bearer of the slit!"" Baker's original concept for Max's flesh gun featured eyes, mouth and foreskin, which Cronenberg found to be ""too graphic"". The cancer effects caused by Max's flesh gun went through various tests, with some tests having the face of the victim being distorted through the use of solvents, but Baker decided against this upon learning that his mentor, Dick Smith, had recently used the same technique in Spasms. Baker settled on having the cancer tumors burst out from the body of Barry Convex, with his crew operating a dummy underneath the set. Lennick devised effects such as having the image of the Videodrome television set distort whenever Max would whip it through the use of a device which he called the ""Videodromer"", and glitch and twitch effects related to Max's visions through the Videodrome helmet, but these effects were scrapped due to budget and time concerns. An original score was composed for Videodrome by Cronenberg's close friend, Howard Shore. The score was composed to follow Max Renn's descent into video hallucinations, starting out with dramatic orchestral music that increasingly incorporates, and eventually emphasizes, electronic instrumentation. To achieve this, Shore composed the entire score for an orchestra before programming it into a Synclavier II digital synthesizer. The rendered score, taken from the Synclavier II, was then recorded being played in tandem with a small string section. The resulting sound was a subtle blend that often made it difficult to tell which sounds were real and which were synthesized. The soundtrack was also released on vinyl by Varèse Sarabande, and was re-released on compact disc in 1998. The album itself is not just a straight copy of Shore's score, but a remix. Shore has commented that while there were small issues with some of the acoustic numbers, ""on the whole I think they did very well"". Cronenberg stated that the first test screening of a 72-75 minute cut of the film was ""the most disastrous screening you can imagine"". He and editor Ronald Sanders ""thought we had cut it really tight, but it was totally incomprehensible that you didn't even know that Max Renn worked at Civic TV, I'd cut out all the footage that explained that"". The MPAA requested multiple edits to the film. Bob Remy, the head of Universal Pictures, also suggested removing the scene in Samurai Dreams showing the dildo. Cronenberg was confused by Remy's suggestion as the ""MPAA didn't even ask me to cut that. Why is he asking me to cut that"". Thom Mount told Cronenberg that it was due to Remy having ""a problem with cocks"". The film's runtime was 87 minutes and 18 seconds in Canada and the United States, but was 15 seconds longer in the international version. Cronenberg was critical of edits Universal Pictures performed on the film without request from the MPAA. According to Tim Lucas, Videodrome deals with ""the impression of a sprawlingly technological world on our human senses; the fascination and horror of sex and violence; and the boundaries of reality and consciousness."" David was able to get Universal Pictures to finance and distribute the film based ""on a one-page description,"" according to Cronenberg. Videodrome was distributed by Universal Pictures in Canada and the United States, and by Les Films Mutuels in Quebec. It was released in six hundred theatres on 4 February 1983. Cronenberg stated that Sidney Sheinberg regretted giving the film a wide theatrical release rather than treating it as an art film. Around 900 prints of the film were distributed according to Cronenberg, and the film was only in theaters for a short amount of time. Cronenberg stated that Videodrome wasn't an exploitation sell, and it wasn't an art sell. I don't know what it was."" The film holds a 80% aggregate rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 54 reviews, with an average score of 7.410. Its consensus states, ""Visually audacious, disorienting, and just plain weird, Videodrome's musings on technology, entertainment, and politics still feel fresh today."" It has been described as a ""disturbing techno-surrealist film"" and ""burningly intense, chaotic, indelibly surreal, absolutely like nothing else"". Janet Maslin of The New York Times remarked on the film's ""innovativeness"", and praised Woods' performance as having a ""sharply authentic edge"". Adam Smith of Empire gave the film 4 out of 5 possible stars, calling it a ""perfect example"" of body horror. The staff of Variety wrote that the film ""proves more fascinating than distancing"", and commended the ""stunning visual effects"". Gary Arnold of The Washington Post gave the film a negative review, calling it ""simultaneously stupefying and boring"". C.J. Henderson reviewed Videodrome in The Space Gamer No. 63. Henderson commented that ""Despite the fact that Videodrome came and went faster than Superman and his bullet, it is still an excellent picture. It is a genre film of high caliber, posing a number of important questions."" Christopher John reviewed Videodrome in Ares Magazine #14 and commented that ""As usual, Cronenberg has pulled no punches in getting his message across. The movie is tight, and perfectly clear for anyone willing to watch the screen and think about what they are seeing."" Trace Thurman of Bloody Disgusting listed it as one of eight ""horror movies that were ahead of their time"". It was also selected as one of the ""23 weirdest films of all time"" by Total Film. Nick Schager of Esquire ranked the film at number 10 on their list of ""the 50 best horror movies of the 1980s"". The film won a number of awards upon its release. At the 1984 Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film, it tied with Bloodbath at the House of Death for Best Science-Fiction Film, and Mark Irwin received a CSC Award for Best Cinematography in a Theatrical Feature. Videodrome was also nominated for eight Genie Awards, with David Cronenberg tying Bob Clark's A Christmas Story for Best Achievement in Direction. It was the first Genie Award that Cronenberg won. Videodrome was named the 89th-most-essential film in history by the Toronto International Film Festival. Videodrome was released on VHS and DVD in the late 1990s by Universal Studios Home Entertainment, who also released the film on LaserDisc. The film was released on DVD by the Criterion Collection on August 31, 2004, and their Blu-ray edition was released on December 7, 2010. The Criterion Blu-ray features two commentary tracks, one with Cronenberg and cinematographer Mark Irwin, and the other with actors James Woods and Deborah Harry. Among the other special features are a documentary titled Forging the New Flesh; the soft-core video Samurai Dreams; the 2000 short film Camera; three trailers for Videodrome; and Fear on Film, which consists of an interview with Cronenberg, John Carpenter and John Landis, hosted by Mick Garris. In 2015, Arrow Films released the film on Blu-ray in Region B with further special features, including Cronenberg's short films Transfer (1966) and From the Drain (1967), as well as his feature films Stereo (1969) and Crimes of the Future (1970). A novelization of Videodrome was released by Zebra Books alongside the movie in 1983. Though credited to ""Jack Martin"", the novel was, in fact, the work of horror novelist Dennis Etchison. Cronenberg reportedly invited Etchison up to Toronto, where they discussed and clarified the story, allowing the novel to remain as close as possible to the actions in the film. There are some differences, however, such as the inclusion of the ""bathtub sequence"", a scene never filmed in which a television rises from Max Renn's bathtub like in Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus. This was the result of the lead time required to write the book, which left Etchison working with an earlier draft of the script than was used in the film.",Normal

"The Siemens-Duewag Supertram is a fleet of 25 trams built by Siemens-Duewag of Düsseldorf, Germany, in 1992 for use on the Sheffield Supertram light rail network in England. They were the only trams in use on the network until the entry into service of British Rail Class 399 tram-trains in 2017. As of May 2020, all 25 remain operational. After undergoing trials on Düsseldorf's Rheinbahn system, the trams were delivered to Sheffield via the Rotterdam-Immingham cargo ship route. The trams are bidirectional and consist of three articulated carriages with a low-floor area of 40%. All four entrances are at 42cm (16.5in) low level matching the height of the platforms to provide level access. The low-floor areas have limited seating and provide space for pushchairs and wheel chairs. The high floor areas are 88cm (34.6in) high and can be found at the outer-end of each end carriage and in the centre carriage; they are reached by either two or three steps. Because the Supertram network includes gradients up to 10%, all vehicle axles are powered, which limits the low-floor area to that between the bogies. For maximized low floor area, the middle bogies are installed entirely below the centre carriage section rather than under the articulations. The wheels are type Bochum 84, have resilient rubber inserts and have a diameter of 67cm (26.4in). They may be worn to a diameter of at least 59cm (23.2in). There are four monomotor bogies, each powered by a longitudinally suspended DC motor driving both axles. The power supply is 750VDC from overhead lines using a Brecknell Willis high reach pantograph. Speed is controlled from the cab by a joystick controller with a Dead man's switch, which must be held in place to keep the track brakes from automatically applying. No other vigilance control is fitted, because of the perceived safety of a system of street-running trams. Drivers are seated on sprung seats for comfort and a public address system allows them to communicate with passengers. The vehicle interior is designed to meet safety requirements. The interior fittings have no sharp edges to prevent any injury and there are numerous grab rails for standing passengers. The interior lining of the ceiling consists of aluminium honeycomb bonded with melamine coloured resin. The lining is attached to suspension points welded to the roof section. The inside walls are made from coloured melamine material. The complete lining for the articulations consists of coloured fibreglass. The rear wall of the driving cab is made of laminated wood with a melamine veneer. Passengers have 86 upholstered seats, mostly arranged face to face. The low floor areas possess minimum seating to provide space for wheelchairs in accordance with the requirements of the DPTAC. Studies were carried out by the Cranfield Institute of Technology to ensure that all members of the public may have access to the vehicles. From September 2005, the trams' manual destination boards were changed to multicolour LED signs conforming with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA), whilst pre-recorded next stop announcements were introduced to replace announcements made by drivers. Three voices with local accents were chosen to record the destination messages on the three different tram lines. All trams were refurbished between January 2006 and February 2009, with the first refurbished tram being launched at Supertram's Nunnery depot on 27 January 2006. The refurbishment bought the trams to conform to the Disability Discrimination Act inside, whilst also repainting the trams into new Stagecoach corporate colours, finished in a blue livery similar to that of South West Trains. In May 2009 the second part of the refresh programme began, which was an overhaul of the tram's under-floor running equipment. It lasted until the end of 2012 and meant that one tram was once again permanently unavailable for service, and the system therefore continued to operate with 23 trams out of an 'available for service' fleet of 25. The initial tram livery was overall light grey with a dark blue skirt, and Supertram fleetnames. A minor modification appeared just prior to the Stagecoach Group rebranding, when the current motto was added to the centre car in large letters under the windows. Following the Stagecoach being awarded the operating franchise in 1997, the trams were rebranded into the corporate Stagecoach identity, a white base with three stripes, with a Stagecoach fleet name and SUPERTRAM strapline, in line with their UK bus fleet. Later, as the bus fleets were given a new livery, a dark blue base was added under the orange, red and blue stripes. Between January 2006 and January 2009 the entire fleet was refurbished internally as part of the 'refresh programme'. In parallel, the tram livery was rebranded to the current scheme, a predominantly blue livery and more prominent logo and a smaller subordinate Stagecoach identifier. This was loosely based on the blue version of the South West Trains corporate Stagecoach livery. Before and after images of the refresh are available on the operator's website. In addition to the standard liveries, a number of all over advertising schemes have been used on individual trams for places such as the Meadowhall Centre, a jobs website, sister Stagecoach company East Midlands Trains, the new Sheffield IKEA store, Doncaster Sheffield Airport, XPO Logistics and fashion website PrettyLittleThing. Since 2010, tram 120 has featured a non-standard livery to mark the 50th anniversary of the closure of the former tram network and to celebrate the influence of the trams on the city. The design featured a similar blue and cream colour as were used on the original Sheffield Tramway, the Sheffield City coat of arms and removal of the external advertisements. Tram 120 has recently been repainted and no longer carries this livery.",Normal
"The Portrait of Philip IV in Fraga is a mid-length portrait of Philip IV of Spain by Velázquez. It was painted over the course of three sessions in June 1644 in Fraga, where Philip IV had moved the royal court as part of the ""Jornada de Aragón"" which resulted in the recovery of Lérida from France, which had occupied the city earlier during the Reapers' War. The portrait was gifted by Philip V to his son, the future Philip, Duke of Parma, and the painting left Spain along with him in 1748. In 1911 it was acquired by the Frick Collection, where it is currently on display. This is almost certainly the same painting which Antonio Palomino said Velázquez painted of the king in a natural manner ""in the way he entered Lérida, wielding a military staff, and dressed in crimson plush, with such a beautiful air, so much grace, and majesty, that the painting looked like another living Philip"". Much is known of the circumstances surrounding the painting of the portrait due to extant expense accounts, including masonry costs related to the creation of two windows in the throne room where the king was to pose, as well as expenses related to the renovation of the facilities that Velázquez used as a studio, which had been in a ruinous state. At the same time he worked on this painting, he worked on another painting, one of the court dwarf Diego de Acedo, known as El Primo, which was sent to Madrid in June. The painting appears to have been different than the painting of the dwarf which is currently at the Prado. The painting was finished before the end of June, and was sent to Philip IV's wife Elisabeth, who ordered its public exhibition. José Pellicer in his Avisos históricos noted that on August 16, 1644 that a painting of the king portrayed ""in the same way that he is in the field"", dressed in red and silver, had been exhibited in the church of San Martín, ""under a canopy embroidered with gold, where many people came to see it and copies are being made of it"". Jonathan Brown suggests that Velázquez's composition might have been inspired by Anthony van Dyck's, Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria, which had been in Madrid since 1636. Among the known copies, the most esteemed is held in the Dulwich College of London, which had previously mistakenly been considered Velasquez's original, before it was attributed to Juan Bautista Martínez del Mazo in 1911 by Aureliano de Beruete, leading to the copy in New York being identified as the original. The painting (most likely a copy) appears in the 1941 film, The Maltese Falcon.",Normal
"See text Gastrolobium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. There are over 100 species in this genus, and all but two are native to the south west region of Western Australia. A significant number of the species accumulate monofluoroacetate (the key ingredient of the poison known commonly as 1080), which caused introducednon native animal deaths from the 1840s in Western Australia. The controversy over the cause of the stock poisoning in that time involved the botanist James Drummond in a series of tests to ascertain the cause of the poisoning, which was determined to be caused primarily by the plants York Road poison (G. calycinum) and Champion Bay poison (G. oxylobioides). In the 1930s and 1940s C.A. Gardner and H.W. Bennetts identified other species in Western Australia, leading to the publication of The Toxic Plants of Western Australia in 1956. The base chromosome number of Gastrolobium is 2n = 16. Gastrolobium comprises the following species: The status of the following species is unresolved:",Normal
"Rosebank is one of the Southern Suburbs of Cape Town, South Africa, located between the suburbs of Mowbray and Rondebosch. Rosebank is located on the lower eastern slope of Devil's Peak, stretching down to the Liesbeeck River, and on the other side of the river up to the edge of Rondebosch Common. On the west it is bounded by the M3 freeway. The historic Mostert's Mill is located just next to the freeway. Much of the land between the M3 and Main Road, which runs north-south through the suburb, belongs to the University of Cape Town and is used for residences and sports fields. The area around Main Road is a mixture of university residences, shops and blocks of flats. Parallel to Main Road, and one block east from it, the Metrorail Southern Line divides Rosebank in half; Rosebank railway station is the main public transport facility in the suburb. There are no road crossings of the railway in Rosebank; the nearest are the Durban Road bridge in Mowbray to the north and the Belmont Road bridge in Rondebosch to the south. There are, however, several pedestrian subways under the railway. The area east of the railway, as far as Liesbeek Parkway, contains a mixture of blocks of flats and detached houses; many of the residences in this area are occupied by students from the university. The Cape Town offices of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the South African Bureau of Standards are also located here. Liesbeek Parkway is a dual carriageway which runs north-south through the suburb, running mostly parallel to the Liesbeeck River. East of Liesbeek Parkway and the river is an area of larger houses, with a more affluent population. Also located in this area is Rustenburg Girls' High School. According to the 2011 Census, the population of Rosebank consisted of 4,963 people in 1,343 households. 45% of the population described themselves as ""Black African"", 38% as ""White"", 9% as ""Coloured"" and 6% as ""Indian or Asian"". Of those who were asked about their first language (which excluded those in university residences), 65% spoke English, 9% spoke Afrikaans and 6% spoke isiZulu. Notably, 12% spoke a language that was not one of South Africa's 11 official languages. 50% of residents of the suburb live in institutions (principally university residences), 30% live in flats, and 19% live in houses. Over 99% of residents had mains electricity, piped drinking water, a flush toilet and regular refuse collection.",Normal

"Lord Lyndoch was launched in 1814 at Calcutta. After she sailed to England she made one voyage for the British East India Company (EIC). Between 1831 and 1841 she made five voyages transporting convicts to Australia, three to Hobart and two to Sydney. She became a transport and suffered a maritime incident in 1844. She was last listed in 1847. Lord Lyndoch first appeared in Lloyd's Register (LR) in 1816. EIC voyage (1816–1817): The EIC had Lord Lyndoch measured before her voyage for them. Captain James Crichton sailed from the Downs on 23 January 1816, bound for St Helena and China. Lord Lyndoch reached St Helena on 10 April and Penang on 21 July, and arrived at Whampoa Anchorage on 31 August. Homeward bound she crossed the Second Bar on 28 December. She reached St Helena on 18 March 1817 and arrived back at the Downs on 27 May. Thereafter, Lord Lyndoch traded with India under a licence from the EIC. On 28 November 1817 Lord Lyndoch, Templeton, master, ran on shore at Blackwall, but was gotten off the next day after she had taken out her guns, anchors, and cables. She had not sustained any damage and was expected to resume her voyage to Rio de Janeiro, the River Plate, and Batavia. The Registers were only as accurate as owners chose to keep them. In 1820 Captain Andrew Balfour Clapperton had assumed command of Lord Lyndoch. Though she did not appear in the 1819 volume of the East-India register and directory, she did appear in the 1824 volume (the volumes for the intervening years not being available online). Her master was A.B.Clapperton, her owners Alexander & Co., and her registry was Calcutta again. Around 1822 Captain Clapperton performed a circumnavigation of the globe. He sailed via Cape Horn with a crew of lascars, and suffered no losses on the voyage. In 1827 Lord Lyndoch was still listed as being registered at Calcutta. Her master was W.T.Harris, and her owners were still Alexander & Co. However, at some point she was sold to Beadle & Co., of London. She then returned to Lloyd's Register. In 1829 Joseph Somes, of London, purchased Lord Lyndoch. 1st convict voyage (1831): Captain John H. Luscombe sailed from Sheerness on 25 July 1831. Lord Lyndoch arrived at Hobart on 18 November. She had embarked 266 male convicts and suffered no convict deaths on her voyage. 2nd convict voyage (1833): Captain William Johnston sailed from Sheerness in June 1833. She sailed via Rio de Janeiro and arrived at Sydney on 18 October. She had embarked 330 male convicts and suffered four deaths on the voyage. 3rd convict voyage (1836): Captain John Baker sailed from London on 24 April 1836 and arrived at Hobart on 20 August. She had embarked 330 male convicts and suffered five convict deaths on the voyage. 4th convict voyage (1838): Captain William Stead sailed from England on 4 April 1838 and arrived at Sydney on 8 August. She had embarked 330 male convicts and suffered 19 convict deaths en route. Lord Lyndoch was subject to an outbreak of scurvy, was the worst to have occurred on a convict transport. It first appeared as Lord Lyndoch was east of the Cape of Good Hope, and 160 men showed symptoms to a great or lesser degree. Eight men died of scurvy (the other 11 deaths were due to other diseases), and another 20 men died of the disease after she had arrived at Port Jackson. With a loss of one convict for every 17.3 embarked, this was the 10th worst casualty rate (not including the wrecking of George III), in the history of convict transportation to Australia. 5th convict voyage (1840–1841): Captain John Humble sailed from London on 9 September 1840 and arrived at Hobart on 5 February 1841. She had embarked 321 male convicts and suffered six convict deaths on her voyage. For this voyage Somes received £15 14s per ton burthen, for 638 tons, or slightly over £10,000. She then became a transport with Thomas Cauney, or J. Canney, master. Lord Lyndoch was damaged by fire before 4 January 1844. She was on a voyage from Singapore to Madras. She was carrying the headquarters and part of the 24th regiment of Foot. The fire started with the ignition of some spirits in the spirit room and burned for three to four hours before it was put out. Lord Lyndoch underwent small repairs in 1845.

"The historic parish of Bircle, near Bury, England, was created on 1 July 1846, although the village of Bircle (now known as Birtle) has existed for many centuries.

Names such as ""Cleggs Wood"", ""Simpson Clough"" and ""Dobb Wood"" appear on early Ordnance Survey maps. ""Hill' appeared in the fourteenth century in the name of 'Birkhill' but it never found a permanent place. Over time its name has also appeared as Brithull, 1243; Birlcil, 1246; Birkhill, 1334, 1573; but Bircle appears in the Diocese of Manchester directory in England. Bircle Church is on Castle Hill Road. The church of St John the Baptist, also known as Bircle Church, is a listed building for its special architectural or historic interest. The church was designed by architect George Shaw and was first dedicated in 1846. It is a small church and is a relatively early example of ecclesiologically correct Gothic rock-faced ashlar with ashlar dressings and slate roofs with stone-coped gables. The nave and chancel both have hammer beam roofs rising from stone corbels. Carved angels holding shields are on the ends of the hammer beams. There are four stained glass windows in the nave, which were given in memory of loved ones. They depict Ruth, Saint Peter, Saint Paul and Mary, the mother of Jesus. On the wooded ceiling are carved angel figures. Long:-2.260 Lat:53.607 The mural in Bircle church hall was painted by the local potter Harry Johnston. In 1852, plans were made for a workhouse to accommodate 400 inmates, with a separate 60-bed hospital in Jericho. Jericho Workhouse, also known as the Bury Union Workhouse , was opened on 21 January 1857, and a year later the total expenditure for the scheme had swollen to £20,481. Inmates came from as far away as Spain. In the 1881 census a 64-year-old named Susannah Allport, a Bonnet Maker (Milliner) from Salamanca was in residence. Today it is the site of Fairfield General Hospital. The Road to Jericho 1775 – A workhouse was built on Manchester Road, Redvales, Bury. 1825 – Bury Select Vestry recommended that the town needed to build a new workhouse or improve the existing one. 1827 – The Vestry decided to extend the existing Bury workhouse. 1837 – The Poor Law Union was formally declared on 8 February. 1850 – The Bury Board of Guardians were refused an extension on the lease of land for the workhouses. 1852 – The Bury Board of Guardians gave notice that they were prepared to receive plans and specifications for a new Union workhouse capable of support 400 inmates with suitable outbuildings, yards and conveniences. 1853 – The Vaccination Act introduced compulsory vaccination against smallpox. It required that every child, health permitting should be vaccinated within 3 months, or in the case of orphans, 4 months of birth. 1855 – Work began on the new Bury Union workhouse at Jericho, almost two miles east of Bury on Rochdale Old Road. 1857 – The Bury Union workhouse opened on 21 January. The total cost of building and land was £21,418. 1858 – The Bury Union workhouse was consecrated by the Bishop of Manchester on 26 July. 1862 – Additions were made to the Bury Union workhouse providing separate infant accommodation. 1867 – The poor law guardians were to control vaccination districts and pay vaccinators from 1 – 3 shillings per child vaccinated in the district. 1868 – Additions were made to the Bury Union Workhouse to provide separate accommodation for the 'insane'. 1877 – On 9 June the foundation stone for a new 32 bed infectious diseases hospital at the Jericho site was made by Alderman John Duckworth, chairman of the Bury Board of Guardians. There was also to be a nurses' home and mortuary. 1878 – The infectious diseases unit was opened on 24 August. 1903–1905 – A new 126 bed infirmary with a maternity ward and staff accommodation was erected on the Jericho site. The site was officially opened on 20 September 1905. 1904 – The Registrar General requested that the workhouse births were to be disguised by the use of postal addresses. Birth certificates for those born in the Bury Union workhouse gave the address 380 Rochdale Old Road, Bury and did not name the workhouse. 1911 – Bury Union workhouse added an annexe to house male inmates. 1929 – Bury Union workhouse was renamed Jericho Institution. 1946 – The last burial took place at the Jericho Institution cemetery. 1948 – The Jericho Institution became part of the National Health Service and was renamed Fairfield General Hospital. The Cheesden Valley runs on a north-south alignment between Bury and Rochdale. Cheesden Brook runs through the valley, joining with Naden Brook to eventually run into the River Roch near Heywood. During the industrial age, the valley became a centre of cotton production, dependent on running water. The valley is now reclaiming the once busy mills and returning them to nature. The Lost Mills can be seen from the air. It encompasses Deeply Vale, Bircle Dene and Ashworth Valley. As early as 1580, Queen Elizabeth I granted John Blackwall the right to mine coal in the Cheesden Valley. In addition, it is believed that during the 17th century, small communities – ""folds"" – could have had their own mines. There are signs of human activity dating from about 8000 BC. Flints from the Mesolithic period have been found in the Cheesden Valley and Knowl Moor areas. All were discovered on high ground close to a water source, and all are small and suitable for use as arrowheads and similar objects. About Archives+ Archives+ has created an archive in Manchester.

"Universal Flowering (Mirovoi rastsvet) is the name given by Pavel Filonov to his system of analytical art. The system arose from cubo-futurist experiments and works that he undertook from 1913 to 1915. It is characterized by very dense, minutely facetted, and relatively flat surfaces created by working from the particular to the general, using the smallest of brushes and the sharpest of pencils. The images have both Cubism's multiple vantage points and Futurism's representation of a figure over time. A number of the paintings, while having a given orientation, are painted as though they could be oriented in a variety of ways. Filonov's philosophy was originally formalized in written form in 1915, which was revised and published as The Declaration of Universal Flowering in 1923 when Filonov was a professor at the (then) Petrograd Academy of Arts. Filonov's main theoretical work The Ideology of Analytical Art (Ideologia analiticheskogo iskusstva) was published in 1930. This art movement–related article is a stub.

"Petre Paul Negulescu (October 18, 1870 – September 28, 1951) was a Romanian philosopher and conservative politician, known as a disciple and continuator of Titu Maiorescu. Affiliated with Maiorescu's Junimea society from his early twenties, he debuted as a positivist and monist, attempting to reconcile art for art's sake with an evolutionist philosophy of culture. He was a lecturer and tenured professor at the University of Iași, where he promoted the Junimist lobby against left-wing competitors, and formalized his links with the Conservative Party in 1901. From 1910, he taught at the University of Bucharest, publishing works on Renaissance philosophy and other historical retrospectives. After World War I, Negulescu was an affiliate (later president) of the radical-conservative People's Party, and an advocate of labor and education reform. Serving several terms in Parliament, he was twice the Public Education Minister in the 1920s, but failed to enact his project for vocational-centered schooling. By 1934, as an adversary of the nationalist far-right, he wrote tracts rejecting biological determinism of all sorts, and scientific racism in particular. Pushed in the minority by supporters of statism, Negulescu supported meritocracy within the framework of classical liberalism. He was sidelined by right-wing totalitarian regimes after 1940, and ultimately banned, shortly before his death, by the communist regime. Petre Negulescu is widely believed to have been born in Ploiești in October 1872. However, his early papers give his birth date as October 18, 1870, a date he probably concealed and replaced for vanity reasons. As a youth, he attended Saints Peter and Paul High School in his native city, and subsequently enrolled in the sciences faculty of the University of Bucharest, being especially interested in mathematics. After hearing several lectures on the history of philosophy delivered by Titu Maiorescu, he transferred to the literature and philosophy faculty, graduating in 1892. In March 1891, by that time a student of Maiorescu's, he began attending meetings of Junimea literary society, where he met Simion Mehedinți and Mihail Dragomirescu. From his student days, Negulescu supported the patriotic activism of Romanians in Austro-Hungarian-ruled Transylvania. In 1890, together with Mehedinți, he edited Memoriul studenților universitari români privitor la situația românilor din Transilvania și Ungaria (""A Memorandum of Romanian University Students Regarding the Situation of Romanians in Transylvania and Hungary""), a document that also appeared in French and was meant to draw European public attention to the Magyarization policy of the Budapest government. He belonged to the leadership committee of the Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians, founded in Bucharest the same year. Encouraged by his mentor, he completed his theoretical preparation at the universities of Berlin, Leipzig and Paris. He became an associate professor in 1894, aged 22, in the history of modern philosophy and logic department of the University of Iași. Both Negulescu and Teohari Antonescu, the archaeologist, were moved there in a bid to ensure Junimea control over the university, and to consolidate the conservative circles of Iași, against a rising tide of socialist influence. Although he found the city ""repulsive"" and a ""place of exile"", Negulescu accepted his appointment as a political and cultural mission. He was soon disappointed by the local Junimea branch and its president, N. Volenti, asking Maiorescu to send them better cultural material. In these early years, Negulescu was heavily indebted to Maiorescu's influence, down to oratory: he was known (and ridiculed) for copying Maiorescu's speech mannerisms. Also like Maiorescu, he was an atheist and a positivist, who read religion in functionalist terms. Negulescu's publishing debut came in 1892, with a metaphysical essay, Critica apriorismului și a empirismului (""A Critique of Apriorism and Empiricism""), earning him the Romanian Academy award in philosophy. The title indicates the two main philosophical currents rejected by Negulescu, who sought a middle road between transcendental idealism and resurgent anti-realism, finalism, and theism. He found it in ""realistic empiricism"", a brand of monism, evolutionism and scientism that quoted heavily from Herbert Spencer. His monistic outlook fell short of classical positivism and historical materialism, since it rehabilitated metaphysical inquiry as a legitimate pursuit. Various authors have regretfully noted that Negulescu never truly developed his tentative metaphysical system, which appeared to them inconclusive. Negulescu followed up with works of aesthetics, including: Psihologia stilului (""The Psychology of Style"", 1892), Impersonalitatea și morala în artă (""Impersonality and Morality in Art"", 1893), Religiunea și arta (""Religion and Art"", 1894), Socialismul și arta (""Socialism and Art"", 1895). Later, he published works of applied philosophy: Filosofia în viața practică (""Philosophy in Practical Life"", 1896), and Rolul ideilor în progresul social (""The Role of Ideas in Social Progress"", 1900). The latter works, of which Psihologia stilului was serialized in Maiorescu's Convorbiri Literare journal, were also attacks against the socialist literary critic, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, who had tackled Junimea's art for art's sake ideology with calls for didacticism. Dragomirescu and Negulescu remained the only two Maiorescu disciples who carried on his work in pure aesthetics; others, such as Alexandru Philippide and Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, began as aestheticists, but later veered into more applied science. According to historian Z. Ornea, Negulescu stood further apart from Maiorescu not just because he questioned the more detailed aspects of his agenda, but also because he was a moderate, whereas Dragomirescu was a man of ""rigid convictions"" and ""systematic dogmatism"". His polemic with the socialists, inaugurated in Psihologia stilului, was largely tributary to the theories of Spencer, Frédéric Paulhan, and Jean-Marie Guyau, trying to show that Junimism was more in tune with modern literary criticism. The implicit target was Dobrogeanu-Gherea, depicted by Negulescu as a pale imitator of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and his ""social destination"" of art. However, with Religiunea și arta, Negulescu went beyond Maiorescu's theories, and closer to Dobrogeanu-Gherea's, proposing that poetic art was not just a luxury of advanced societies, but also a functional entity that contributed to social progress. He also proposed interpreting style and tastefulness as variables emerging from objective psychological criteria, such as the ""economy of attention"" and ""nervous excitement"". On this basis, he proposed a general hierarchy of art by appeal and subject matter, ranking old Egyptian murals below Italian Renaissance painting, but above the minor art of medieval goldsmiths. He believed that art and religion served similar purposes in stirring up vital emotions, and amended the art for art's sake theory with his ideas on ""impersonality"", implying objectivity for the artist, but also a subjective, self-absorbed, relevancy for his artistic creation. Negulescu spent those years traveling extensively in Europe, cementing his friendship with Maiorescu and with fellow Junimists. In 1894, he and Dumitru Evolceanu were in Gräfenberg, where the latter was curing his ""sexual neurasthenia"". It was in that context that Negulescu discovered and promoted Evolceanu as a storyteller, the literary hope of Junimea. Later, Maiorescu took Negulescu along on vacations to Abbázia. In Romania and abroad, Negulescu spent much time with Antonescu, who left notes about Negulescu's eccentric habits, including his asceticism, complete sexual abstinence, and social awkwardness. In 1894, Maiorescu wrote confidently that the stage now belonged to ""the second-generation Junimea"", comprising Negulescu, Evolceanu, Antonescu, and Dragomirescu. While preparing for print Religiunea și arta, Negulescu found himself caught in a conflict with Nicolae Basilescu and other non-orthodox Junimists, who rejected his theories from a historicist perspective. In resisting Basilescu, he reaffirmed his purist reading of Maiorescu's credo, namely that ""truth"" was the universal artistic criterion, and formal perfection an objective trait. He restated these tenets in an extended polemic with the anti-Junimist ideologue N. Petrașcu, the bulk of which became a standalone essay, Lucruri vechi (""Old Things"", 1898). However, by then, he himself had embraced some of Basilescu's historicist views about art as an expression of civilization, trying to bring them into agreement with arguments picked up from Hippolyte Taine. Negulescu still argued that subjectivity was the main driver of cultural accomplishment, citing extreme (and, according to Ornea, flawed) examples of artists and intellectuals who withstood all immersion in contemporary life, from Galilei to Ingres. Negulescu rose to full professor in 1896, in spite of not having a doctorate; he benefited from Maiorescu's influence and intrigues. Maiorescu preferred him over Rădulescu-Motru, who had parted with mainline Junimism. Counteracting the anti-Junimists, Negulescu and Antonescu gave full support to Dragomirescu, when the latter presented his candidature for a professorship in Bucharest. Meanwhile, Negulescu had a personal conflict with philologist Ilie Bărbulescu, intervening to have him denied employment at Iași. His teaching and research were supplemented by articles he wrote for various magazines, including Convorbiri Literare (of which he became an editor in 1895), Arhiva Societății Științifice și Literare, and Revista Română Politică și Literară. The latter review was largely under his control, and marked his distancing from the Cultural League, publishing critical articles by Ovid Densusianu. According to biographer Eugen Lovinescu, Negulescu was a monotonous intellectual, among the handful of students who lived up to Maiorescu's demand for ""absolute fidelity"" and ""moral servitude"". Eventually, Maiorescu even persuaded his pupil to consider marrying into a better-off family, and to renounce his ""sickly romanticism"". For a while in 1898, he was engaged to Mariette Dabija, the owner of a large country estate. Abandoning such plans, Negulescu remained a recluse and ""pedantic"" teetotaler, also noted for his aversion to smoking. Negulescu entered politics in 1901, as a member of Maiorescu's Conservative Party. He was seen by Maiorescu as a good minister in training, but, in his own account, he only rallied because his teacher had asked him to; overall, he resented political life and disliked the political class. In effect, he followed the Junimist or ""constitutionalist"" inner-Conservative faction, which was quasi-independent from the main party. The year 1902 also marked his split with the Cultural League, after the latter no longer invited him and other Junimea men to attend its congresses. According to a note by their former student Ioan Lupu, before 1910 Antonescu and Negulescu were the most popular professors at Iași, their courses attended by more people than the halls could fit. In December 1910, upon Maiorescu's retirement, Negulescu was finally transferred to the history and encyclopedia of philosophy department at Bucharest; his professorship in Iași was assigned in 1915 to another Junimea favorite, Ion Petrovici. In Bucharest, his assistant was a docent, Mircea Florian, for whom Negulescu created a lecture-master's position in 1924. Negulescu became Florian's friend and godfather, but blocked his academic advancement, refusing to award him a full professorship. Reportedly, this was because he feared that Petrovici, whom he deeply resented, would use the opportunity and place a claim on a Bucharest chair. Negulescu returned to philosophy with a two volumes of Filosofia Renașterii (""Renaissance Philosophy""), respectively published in 1910 and 1914. He continued to maneuver in support of Junimea favorites, working to find Mihai Ralea a professor's chair in Iași, and supporting Dimitrie Gusti, Vasile Pârvan and Ion A. Rădulescu-Pogoneanu when they placed similar bids in Bucharest. He also tried (and failed) to rebuild trust between Maiorescu and the former Junimist playwright Ion Luca Caragiale. During that stage of his career, Negulescu exercised his influence on a new generation of philosophers, including Eugeniu Sperantia, Camil Petrescu, and Tudor Vianu. Petrescu was reportedly his favorite, considered an intellectual equal. Although better known as a novelist, Petrescu always credited Negulescu as an influence on his own work in philosophy and political theory. Negulescu was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy in 1915. A year later, Romania entered World War I, and suffered a German invasion. Negulescu fled occupied Bucharest, and in early 1917, took refuge in the Russian Republic, at Odessa. It was there that he came up with the idea of creating a new party ""of National Renaissance"", to challenge both the dominant National Liberal Party (PNL) and the pro-German Conservatives, and to promote a functional electoral democracy. Over the following months, he co-opted members of the old establishment: the Junimist Gusti, the Conservative Constantin Argetoianu, and the PNL's Constantin Angelescu. In April 1918, he entered the Alexandru Averescu-led People's League upon its establishment in Iași; in 1920, this would become the People's Party (PP), for a while the main opposition force to the PNL. Its mission, according to Negulescu, was to give legal expression to the revolutionary anti-PNL grievances. In November 1918, right after the Armistice with Germany and at the height of European revolutions, Negulescu's Bucharest home hosted negotiations between the radicalized PP and the Socialist Party of Romania (PS), during which it was proposed to turn Romania into a republic, in exchange for socialist participation in government. Early in 1919, Negulescu presided over a Bucharest faculty of philosophy ""review commission"", tasked with investigating colleagues accused of having collaborated with the occupation authorities—such cases included Florian, Rădulescu-Motru, and Rădulescu-Pogoneanu. Negulescu was unenthusiastic about this assignment, and the investigations were cut short when he fell ill (or feigned illness), then resigned. This was the era of Transylvania's union with Romania, which Negulescu fully endorsed, signing at least one petition addressed to the Paris Peace Conference, pleading for the union's recognition. Negulescu continued to take up anti-establishment causes, and, against Argetoianu's advice, convinced the People's League to abstain in protest from participating in the November 1919 election. Although the negotiations of 1918 had failed, Negulescu supported a rapprochement with the PS. After the latter's leadership was arrested for its role in the general strike of 1920, he appeared as a defense witness, arguing that striking was a legitimate tool within capitalist competition. Elected to the Senate in 1920, he won a seat for Prahova in the Assembly of Deputies in 1926. After successfully competing with Petrovici for the position, he was twice Public Education Minister under Averescu: March–December 1921 and March–June 1926. His first term saw tensions inside the PP: Negulescu claimed to have exposed embezzlement by his Transylvanian subordinate, Ioan Lupaș, but that such finds were covered by up on Averescu's order. During his first term, Negulescu tried to implement a law on reforming education in Romania, that would undercut the PNL's project. However, as noted at the time by Gheorghe Vlădescu-Răcoasa, ""everything stood in his way"". Writing at the time, social theorist Ștefan Zeletin suggested that Negulescu's plan was daring and innovative, if heavily indebted to Germanic models and not fully responsive to actual social needs. Concluding that intellectualism had failed, Negulescu favored an 11-year pre-university education, with the introduction of unitary vocational education, the upgrading of normal schools, and the development of secondary education around ""citizen schools"". Another part of his program, on which he could agree with the PNL shadow minister, Angelescu, was the Romanianization of Transylvanian schools, particularly those catering to Hungarians, and the secularization of faith schools. Negulescu wrote that he considered the measure imperative, because of the schools' alleged role in spreading Hungarian irredentism. However, he was lenient toward expressions of Hungarian resentment, vetoing a government clampdown on Hungarian nationalist protesters, and speaking out in Senate in favor of political tolerance; he suggested that Hungarians had reason to view the Treaty of Trianon as a collective shock. His party was ousted from power before he could enact the reform, and Angelescu overturned his conservative policies. His second term cut short by the political power shifts, Negulescu was appointed President of the Assembly, serving from July 1926, when Petrovici took over as Education Minister, and being reelected on November 14, before ultimately stepping down in June 1927. This period was one of political uncertainty: Negulescu's term coincided with revelations that King Ferdinand I was terminally ill with cancer, which renewed calls for a national unity government. His time in office also saw the adoption of labor legislation in April 1927. He remained a vocal critic of Angelescu, noting the ""dizzying"" and ""chaotic"" opening of new schools under his mandate, arguing that the whole effort was low-quality and therefore deceptive. Over those years, Negulescu focused his research on the history of philosophy, as well as one practical and political issues. As noted by Traian Herseni, this new interest was ""related"", albeit not in fact identical, to the sociology of culture. Such works include: Reforma învățământului (""Education Reform"", 1922), Partidele politice (""The Political Parties"", 1926), Geneza formelor culturii (""The Genesis of Cultural Forms"", 1934), Academia platonică din Florența (""The Platonic Academy in Florence"", 1936), Nicolaus Cusanus (1937) and Destinul Omenirii (""The Destiny of Mankind"", Vol. I, 1938; Vol. II, 1939). With his new work in aesthetics, Negulescu expanded his system into psychological determinism, from personality types; he also proposed that art history was a continuous dialogue between ""critical analysis"" and ""imagination"", which succeeded and tempered each other. Scholar Dan Grigorescu views Geneza formelor culturii as Negulescu's masterpiece, but notes that its system of references, comprising Georges Dumas, Joseph Jastrow, Ernst Kretschmer, Theodor Lipps and Paulin Malapert, was quickly outdated. At core, Grigorescu proposes, Geneza was a Renaissance idea, but also similar to contemporary musings by Albert Einstein and Leslie White. At the university, Negulescu held a series of courses that were later also published: Enciclopedia filosofiei (""The Encyclopedia of Philosophy"", 1924–1926), Istoria filosofiei. Pozitivismul francez contemporan (""A History of Philosophy. Contemporary French Positivism"", 1924–1925), Problema ontologică (""The Ontological Issue"", 1927–1928), Problema epistemologiei (""The Epistemological Issue"", 1930–1932) and Enciclopedia filosofiei. Problema cosmologică (""The Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Cosmological Issue"", 1935–1937). His work was carried in interwar newspapers and magazines, primarily the PP's Îndreptarea, Ideea Europeană, and Revista de Filosofie. Negulescu advanced to the rank of titular member of the Romanian Academy in 1936. By then, he was an increasingly isolated critic of the prevailing cultural and political tendencies. Against the protectionism favored by the intellectual class, who felt threatened by the Great Depression, he developed a meritocratic and classically liberal scheme, outlined in Destinul Omenirii. He suggested that intellectuals were clients of the state, who expected secure jobs in the bureaucracy, but who took no personal responsibility for their fate; he favored deregulation and saw the crisis as an opportunity for advancement. Such ideas were expressly rejected by the young right-wing radicals Mircea Eliade and Mihail Polihroniade, who noted that, in his day, Negulescu had had an irreplicable chance at social advancement. Criticism also came in from the left: the communist philosopher Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu argued that Destinul Omenirii was no longer in keeping with Negulescu's earlier materialistic monism, but ""finalistic"" and borderline ""mystical"". Geneza formelor culturii, which sought to discover the natural preconditions of individual philosophical stances, was primarily a critique of popular biological determinism, including degeneration theory and psychoanalytic theory. To these, he opposed a combination of functionalism, mutationism, and environmental determinism. In Geneza, but also in his public pronouncements, Negulescu stood out as a vocal antifascist and a critic of scientific racism. He had a polemic with the staff of the far-right Gândirea, arguing against them that neither biology, nor the Romanian Orthodox ethos, made for concrete realities in grounding national identity and a ""national philosophy""; in his view, ""nation"" was a social construct with no biological basis. Moreover, Negulescu separated ""peaceful and productive"" liberal nationalism from its ethnic counterpart. Implicitly and explicitly, Negulescu also took a stand against the radically fascist and antisemitic Iron Guard. His work upheld the notion that miscegenation was inescapable and observable in Romanian ethnogenesis, and expressed skepticism toward racial serology studies, taken up locally by Sabin Manuilă. Such observations may have contributed to curbing the influence of Nazi racialism on Romanian eugenicists such as Ovidiu Comșia. However, Nichifor Crainic of Gândirea restated the racialist argument in 1934, in a brochure which referred to Negulescu as an ""old philosopher shaped by the ideological school of the bygone century"". Although celebrated at an official level, Negulescu was losing the respect of his students, who visited him in his salon and heard him speak for hours. One of them, the diarist Jeni Acterian, complained that the Negulescu home was ""sinister"". The professor himself, she argued, was ""smart"" but ""dry to the bone"", his voice ""raucous and monotonous"". By his own standards, Negulescu insisted that a professor's job was not primarily about transmitting information, but about ""advancing the science."" Also a student of his, Eliade recalled him as an ""honest"" man of great ""self-discipline"", but generally ""colorless"". The target of his jibes against metaphysics, he argued that Negulescu's scientism was most of all shaped by popular science. They quarreled most bitterly about Eliade's study of Indian philosophy, which Negulescu refused to allow in his university. While speaking out against fascism, Negulescu was also critical of the authoritarian King Carol II who, from 1934, used the state of emergency against both the Iron Guard and liberal democrats. In March 1935, alongside envoys from other groups, he participated in negotiations with Grigore Filipescu's new Conservative Party, seeking a common platform against censorship and repression. Shortly before the start of World War II, Negulescu and Filipescu's political vision was defeated by the rise of successive fascist regimes. The first of these was the National Renaissance Front (FRN), established by Carol. As noted by scholar Maria Bucur, it formalized the clientele system that Negulescu had spoken out against. In February 1938, Averescu resigned the PP presidency and joined the king's supporters; Negulescu replaced him as the head of the moribund party, which survived until the authoritarian constitution came into force later that year, and possibly dissolved itself voluntarily. In 1940, aged 70, Negulescu was forced to retire by the Iron Guard's National Legionary State regime, the onset of a political purge. Partly recovered by the regime of Ion Antonescu, in March 1941 he worked with Gusti, Mihai Ciucă, Radu R. Rosetti, and Liviu Rebreanu on an Academy reform project. It called for increased national propaganda in the Romanian rump state, to compensate for the losses of Bessarabia and Northern Transylvania during the previous year. His inaugural speech at the Academy, held that May, dealt with generational conflict and the factor of progress. In 1942, during Petrovici's term as Education Minister, Vasile Netea of Vremea magazine interviewed him on the topic of education policies. Negulescu had a brief return to cultural prominence in 1945, during a democratic interlude that came after the fall of Antonescu. His political stances were probed by Ion Biberi, in an interview that was published in Democrația weekly. In June 1948, the new communist regime stripped him of membership in the Academy. In his late years, he was persecuted and branded a ""decadent"" philosopher by the official ideologist, Constantin Ionescu Gulian. Negulescu died in obscurity, aged 80, and was buried in Plot 92 of Bellu cemetery. In the 1960s, communist censorship of his work became more lenient, and, by 1979, he was effectively rehabilitated. From 1969 to 1977, volumes of his unpublished works (including university lectures) were put out by the Academy, under the care of Al. Posescu and N. Gogoneață.",Normal

"Dhanggati (Dunghutti, Thangatti), previously known as Dyangadi (Djangadi), is the Australian Aboriginal language once spoken by the Djangadi of the Macleay Valley and surrounding high country of the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales. There is an ongoing program of language-revival. Ngaagu (Ngaku) and Burgadi (Burrgati) were probably dialects. The three together have been called the Macleay Valley language. Shared designated Ceremonial between surrounding tribes ie:Anaiwan, Gumbagerri and including tribes from further West from Armidale to the North at Tenderfield New South Wales and Southern tribes such as the tribes around Nowendoc, S.E New South Wales. Anaiwan Country did trade offs with the surrounding tribes for the use of a Ceremonial site which the 'University of New England' is now located at 'Booloominbah house' (erected 1888) when the then colonial settlement Armidale was becoming an important trade route and penal colony housing a jail at the earliest time of Colonialism and a route further West to the 'Western Plains'. It was also a deterrent to large groups of natives from gathering so their places of the deepest and Spiritual importance was simply replaced by Aboriginal places of ""checks and balances"" to the White Imperialism ways of ""keeping things in check"". The site of this important ceremonial place was the ""Original Square Dance"" ceremony performed by tribal priests. Elders from the past referring to the 'New England' Tablelands as "" Being to cold "". The group's surrounding the areas of Armidale merged with coastal tribes and shared in one of many ceremonies. The Dhunghutti Tribal name for the Creator Spirit was 'Woorparow Yo Wa' (pronounced Woo-PA-Ra Yo- Wa) also known as 'Bhiamie'. The ceremonial meaning and purpose of the ""Original Square Dance,"" is not lost to history. The ceremony is set in ""high up"" Country"" close to the sky. Dhanggati continued to be spoken through the 1960s. Its survival so far into the 20th century can be traced back to the working camps of men from Bellbrook and Lower Creek who escaped social control whilst clearing land for property owners in the western end of the valley. Dhanggati was the language of the camps and working life, away from the pressure to switch to English in the missions and towns. In 1925 at Kempsey Showground, James Linwood addressed in Dhanggati a meeting of the Australian Aboriginal Progressive Association, to protest the actions of the Aborigines Protection Board. Compared with many NSW languages, Dhanggati has a rich collection of historical sources, from written records in the late 19 th and early 20th centuries to recordings of those last speakers in the 1960s and 1970s. These records form the basis for language revival, because we can extract the grammatical information about sounds, words, word building and sentence building that they contain. Dhanggati placenames in the Macleay those currently in use e.g. Yarrahappinni Mountain (a corruption of yarra yabani koala rolling) On linguistic criteria alone, it seems that Dhanggati is more closely related to Anaiwan (Nganyawana) and Yugambal on the Tablelands than any other language. There were at least two dialects, Dhanggati and Buurrgati, the latter is associated with the region around Macksville. Aboriginal people were multi-lingual, speaking the languages of their neighbours as well as their own. There are significant social relationships amongst Dhanggati, Gumbaynggirr and Biripi peoples, including a shared set of marriage sections, which is also a feature of Anaiwan cultural life. Dhanggati has an unusual ""fricitivised rhotic"" allophone of the trill or tap when it occurs between vowels, as in mirri and yarri. Dhanggati has a complex word building strategies including inflectional and derivational suffixes on nouns, adjectives, demonstratives and pronouns. The pronouns include singular, dual and plural number and several cases. There are at least two classes of verbs based on transitivity, with complex word building patterns to express tense, aspect, mood, and to derive other verbs and nominal forms. Dhanggati is taught in two schools on the NSW Mid North Coast. The language program is currently part of the curriculum in Dalaigur Pre School and Green Hill Public, both in Kempsey. The program started about 2000 and now draws on newly made educational resources and the Dhanggati Language Dictionary. The program sees elders working with school staff and the education department to enable local kids to connect with country and strengthen their identity & Culture.",Normal

"A structural analog, also known as a chemical analog or simply an analog, is a compound having a structure similar to that of another compound, but differing from it in respect to a certain component. It can differ in one or more atoms, functional groups, or substructures, which are replaced with other atoms, groups, or substructures. A structural analog can be imagined to be formed, at least theoretically, from the other compound. Structural analogs are often isoelectronic. Despite a high chemical similarity, structural analogs are not necessarily functional analogs and can have very different physical, chemical, biochemical, or pharmacological properties. In drug discovery, either a large series of structural analogs of an initial lead compound are created and tested as part of a structure–activity relationship study or a database is screened for structural analogs of a lead compound. Chemical analogues of illegal drugs are developed and sold in order to circumvent laws. Such substances are often called designer drugs. Because of this, the United States passed the Federal Analogue Act in 1986. This bill banned the production of any chemical analogue of a Schedule I or Schedule II substance that has substantially similar pharmacological effects, with the intent of human consumption. A neurotransmitter analog is a structural analogue of a neurotransmitter, typically a drug. Some examples include:",Normal

"The Mormugão fort was located on the southern tip of the mouth of the Zuari river in Mormugao in the state of Goa on the west coast of India. This fortification was built on the order of the Viceroy of the Portuguese State of India, Dom Francisco da Gama, Fourth Count of Vidigueira, during his second government, for the defense of South Goa bar, which was then capital of the state of India (Estado da Índia). His works began in 1624, according to ancient epigraphic inscriptions. In that century, due to the continuous plagues and attacks that racked the old city of Goa, the Viceroys considered the transfer the capital of Portuguese India (Índia Portuguesa) to Mormugao, for what purpose some buildings were erected. The high project costs led to its abandonment though. The area was lost in 1737, during the invasion of the Marathas. In the nineteenth century, Nova Goa (or Panjim, as it is currently known) became the new capital. Presently, the old fort is severely ruined. The fort had a rectangular plan, with dimensions of 330 by 88 meters, with the vertices balurtes (pentagonal at the land side and quadrangular on the sea-side). Inside stood the service buildings.

"Clackmannanshire (klækˈmænənˌʃɪər, -ʃər ⓘ; Scots: Clackmannanshire; Scottish Gaelic: Siorrachd Chlach Mhanann), or the County of Clackmannan, is a historic county, council area, registration county and lieutenancy area in Scotland, bordering the council areas of Stirling, Fife, and Perth and Kinross. In terms of historic counties it borders Perthshire, Stirlingshire and Fife. The name consists of elements from three languages. The first element is from Scottish Gaelic: Clach meaning ""Stone"". Mannan is a derivative of the Brythonic name of the Manaw, the Iron Age tribe who inhabited the area. The final element is the English word shire. As Britain's smallest historic county, it is often nicknamed ""The Wee County"". When written, Clackmannanshire is commonly abbreviated to Clacks. Clackmannanshire takes its name from the original county town of Clackmannan, which is named after a stone anciently associated with the pre-Christian deity Manau or Mannan. The stone now rests on a larger stone beside the surviving tower of Clackmannan Tolbooth and the Mercat Cross at the top of Main street, Clackmannan. Clackmannanshire became known for the weaving mills powered by the Hillfoots burns. Other industries included brewing, glass manufacture, mining and ship building. Now capitalising on its central position and transport links, Clackmannanshire attracts service industries and tourism. The motto of Clackmannanshire is ""Look Aboot Ye"" (Circumspice in Latin). In 2007 a re-branding exercise led to the area adopting the slogan ""More Than You Imagine"". Clackmannanshire's origins as a shire (the area controlled by a sheriff) are unclear; it had certainly become a shire by 1305, with some suggestion that it may have already existed in the early 1200s. The county town was originally Clackmannan, where a tolbooth was built in 1592 to serve as the sheriff court for the county. Commissioners of Supply were established in 1667 to act as the main administrative body for the shire. In 1822 the sheriff court and meeting place of the commissioners was moved from Clackmannan to Alloa, which had grown to become the more significant town. County Buildings was built in 1865 at the corner of Mar Street and Drysdale Street in Alloa to serve as the courthouse and meeting place for the commissioners. Elected county councils were established in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, taking most of the functions of the commissioners (which were eventually abolished in 1930). Clackmannanshire County Council held its first meeting on 22 May 1890 at the County Buildings in Alloa, which would serve as the county council's headquarters until its abolition in 1975. The 1889 act also led to a review of boundaries, with several exclaves being transferred to a county they actually bordered, and parishes which straddled more than one county being adjusted such that each parish was entirely in a single county. These changes saw Clackmannanshire cede Cambuskenneth to Stirlingshire, whilst it gained Alva from Stirlingshire and parts of Alloa parish which had been in Perthshire. Clackmannanshire County Council was abolished in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which replaced Scotland's counties, burghs and landward districts with a two-tier structure of upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Clackmannanshire became part of the Central region and a Clackmannan district was created covering the pre-1975 county plus the parish of Muckhart, which had been in Perthshire prior to 1975. Further local government reforms in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 saw the regions and districts created in 1975 abolished and replaced with council areas providing all local government services. Clackmannan district became one of the new council areas, taking on the functions of the abolished Central Regional Council. The 1994 act originally named the new council area ""Clackmannan"", but the shadow authority elected in 1995 requested a change of name to ""Clackmannanshire"", which was agreed by the government before the new council area came into force on 1 April 1996. The first election to Clackmannan District Council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new system came into force on 16 May 1975. A shadow authority was again elected in 1995 ahead of the change to council areas which came into force on 1 April 1996. Political control since 1975 has been as follows: The leaders of the council since 1996 have been: Since 2014, the council has been based at Kilncraigs, on Greenside Street in Alloa. After the 1975 local government reorganisation, the old headquarters of Clackmannanshire County Council at the County Buildings reverted to being solely a courthouse, and the old county council's overflow offices in converted houses along nearby Marshill passed to the Central Regional Council. The Clackmannan District Council acquired a modern office building called The Whins on Whins Road to serve as its headquarters, and also took over the former Alloa Town Council building at Greenfield House on Mar Place. Greenfield House had been built as a house in 1894 and had been bought by the old town council in 1952, with its gardens becoming a public park. In 1987 Greenfield House was extended, allowing it to become the district council's headquarters, with The Whins subsequently being turned into the Alloa Business Centre. Greenfield House then served as the council's headquarters until 2014. In 2014 the council moved to Kilncraigs, which had been built in 1904 as the offices, factory and warehouse of John Paton, Son and Co, manufacturers of knitting yarn. After the factory closed the whole building had been converted to offices in 2004. Since 2007 elections have been held every five years under the single transferable vote system, introduced by the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004. Election results since 1995 have been as follows: Since 2007, the council area has been divided into five multi-member wards: The council area is divided into nine community council areas, eight of which have community councils as at 2023, being those marked with an asterisk below. Clackmannanshire's coat of arms is blazoned: Or, a saltire gules; upon a chief vert, between two gauntlets proper, a pale argent charged with a pallet sable. The red saltire on gold is taken from the arms of the Clan Bruce. According to legend, Robert Bruce mislaid his gauntlets while visiting the county, and upon asking where he could find them was told to ""look aboot ye"" (hence the motto). The green chief represents the county's agriculture, while the black and white pale is taken from the arms of the Clan Erskine whose chief the Earl of Mar lives at Alloa Tower. Sir Thomas Bruce 1st Baron of Clackmannan was a member of the House of Bruce and received lands in Clackmannan from his cousin Robert II. In the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Clackmannanshire was the first council area to declare its result. Though some predictions had seen the area as being favourable towards the ""Yes"" side, the ""No"" vote took 53.8% of the area's vote. This was seen as an early sign that Scotland would vote against independence. In the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Clackmannanshire voted by 58% to remain. In terms of population, Clackmannanshire is the smallest council area in mainland Scotland. Its population was 51,540 (in 2021), around half of whom live in the main town and administrative centre, Alloa. The Ochil Hills dominate the northern third of the county, where Ben Cleuch, Clackmannanshire's highest point, can be found. The northernmost salient of the county lies along the Upper Glendevon Reservoir. Strathdevon is immediately to the south of the steep escarpment formed by the Ochil Fault, along which the Hillfoots Villages are located. Strathdevon mostly comprises a lowland plain a few hundred metres either side of the River Devon, which joins the Forth near Cambus. There is also the Black Devon river that flows past the town of Clackmannan to join the Forth near Alloa. This confluence once had a small pier, for portage to Dunmore pier on the south shore, and anchorage of smaller sailing ships, while others of greater tonnage could be accepted at Dunmore pier on the opposite banks of the Forth. Roughly in the centre of the county lies the Gartmorn Dam County Park, and there are small patches of forest in the south-east of the county. Two unnamed peninsulas are formed by meanders in the river Forth along Clackmannanshire's southern boundary; the easternmost of these has two small islands - Tullibody Inch and Alloa Inch - either side of it. The main industries are agriculture, brewing, and formerly coal mining. In 2006, permission was given for a waterfront development of the Docks area of Alloa, which has been in decline since the 1960s. There is a large glass works at Alloa. Alloa railway station reopened in May 2008; prior to this the county had no active railway stations. A new railway line was completed which connected Kincardine and Stirling, and thus reconnecting Alloa to the national rail network for the first time since 1968, was opened to the public. Scheduled passenger services operate only between Alloa and Stirling and onwards to Glasgow and Edinburgh; the line to Kincardine is normally used by freight trains only but some special excursion trains are run by charter operators. An opening ceremony was held on Thursday 15 May 2008, with the first fully functioning passenger service commencing in the new summer timetable on 19 May 2008. The service provides an hourly connection between Alloa, Stirling and Glasgow Queen Street. The Clackmannanshire Bridge, a new road crossing of the Forth intended to ease congestion and pressure on the older Kincardine Bridge, opened in 2008 (technically the span of the new bridge is not within the county, instead falling just outside it and administratively divided between Falkirk and Fife). Major roads in the area are the A91 between Bannockburn and St Andrews which is the main thoroughfare through the Hillfoots Villages, the A907 between Stirling and Dunfermline which passes through Alloa and Clackmannan, the A908 connecting Alloa and Tillicountry, and the A977 (fed by the A876) between Kincardine and Kinross which runs east of Clackmannan. 14,440 8,490 6,310 4,630 4,620 3,260 2,870 2,840 1,290 750",Normal

"""Butterballs"" is the fifth episode of the sixteenth season of the American animated sitcom South Park, and the 228th episode of the series overall. It aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 11, 2012. The episode spoofs the director Jason Russell, the 2011 film Bully, and the anti-bullying movement. When Butters Stotch's schoolmates see him with a black eye, they learn that it was the work of a bully who stole his lunch money for the third day in a row. Stan Marsh and Kyle Broflovski urge Butters to talk to his family, including his grandmother, whom they mention is visiting him this week. However, his grandmother turns out to be the one who bullies him. Eventually, someone secretly contacts Bucky Bailey, an anti-bullying counselor from Bully Buckers, to come to the school. Bailey obliges Mr. Mackey into calling for an assembly, at which he proposes that the students make an anti-bullying video. When no one volunteers to be the leader of the campaign and direct a music video, he starts insulting the assembled students. Stan Marsh volunteers, saying that bullying is a problem that needs to be addressed. Stan's campaign is ""Make Bullying Kill Itself"" which features a video with Cartman dressed in drag and Butters himself paraded in front of everyone in the nude. When Butters expresses reluctance to continue, saying that this will only make things worse, Stan fails to take his viewpoint seriously. As a result, Kyle walks off the project, accusing Stan of virtue signalling by making himself the focus of the project instead of the issue and cautions him not to end up ""naked and jacking it in San Diego"", a reference that Stan does not understand. Stan informs Butters that a Hollywood studio wants to buy the video. Though Stan is cheered by his schoolmates, Bailey corners Stan in the school boys' room, berating him because Stan sold the movie without consulting him, as revenue from the video, which was Bailey's idea, could have brought national exposure to Bully Buckers™. This upsets Stan, who soon breaks down in tears. Later, Mick Jabs, the president of the studio that purchased the video, corners Bailey in the school boys' room, and presents a cease and desist order from his lawyers, threatening to sue him if he licenses the video again. Stan and Butters go on The Dr. Oz Show to promote the movie, but as Dr. Oz continuously tries to pry Butters of his dark secrets in an effort to get him to reveal specifics, Butters finally snaps and physically attacks Oz. Afterwards, Jabs excoriates Stan because the country did not see Butters as a bully victim, but as a violent psychopath. Soon Jabs himself is cornered in a restroom by Jesus, who threatens him with Hell for his behavior if he does not apologize for his hurtful remark regarding the failed taping. Later that night, Butters goes to his grandmother's room as she lies in bed, telling her that he finally stood up for himself. While he admits that it felt good, it ultimately left with him a dark and empty feeling, just as he imagines she feels. He then tells her that he has realized that bullies will always exist, and while such stages in life seem as if they will last forever to kids, one day he will grow into a happy adult, and as she lies dying in a hospital, he will visit her to show her that he is still alive and happy, while she will die the same empty, sad person she has always been. The next day, Stan is pilloried by students and teachers at school for humiliating them, as well as Jabs' studio canceling its distribution of the video, and a lawsuit that Dr. Oz has filed against Stan and South Park Elementary. Stan resolves to go to San Diego just as Kyle warned him he would where he has a mental breakdown, strips off his clothes, masturbates and dances naked in public, à la Jason Russell. Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode a 7.5 ""Good"" rating, lauding the reveal of Butters' grandmother as the bully, and finding her verbal abuse of Butters to be ""priceless"". Though the bathroom gag was more disappointing than Nicholson thought it would be, Nicholson felt that the scenes with Butters and his grandmother tied the episode together, in particular his final ""moment of clarity"" speech. Nicholson also enjoyed Stan's nude dance in San Diego, not knowing it was a reference to the Jason Russell scandal. Nicholson was less impressed by the students' music video, as he did not initially know that it was a nod to an anti-bullying music video made at Cypress Ranch High School, which he thought was too obscure a reference, marring the episode somewhat. Carl Cortez of Assignment X gave the episode a B+, calling their take on school bullying ""hilarious"", and saying of the interaction between Butters and his grandmother, ""It’s brilliant and funny and wrong, but the best South Park's always are."" Four months after the episode released, the ending musical number ""San Diego"" was released on iTunes under Comedy Central Records. For Record Store Day 2013, the song was released as a 7-inch vinyl picture disc single, with the song ""Gay Fish"" from the episode ""Fishsticks"" as the B-side.",Normal

"Haplogroup Q-M3 (Y-DNA) is a Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup. Haplogroup Q-M3 is a subclade of Haplogroup Q-L54. Haplogroup Q-M3 was previously known as Haplogroup Q3; currently Q-M3 is Q1b1a1a below Q1b-M346. In 1996 the research group at Stanford University headed by Dr. Peter Underhill first discovered the SNP that was to become known as M3. At the time, it was called DYS191. Later studies completed the genetic bridge by determining that Q-M3 was related to Q-M242-bearing populations who traveled through Central Asia to East Asia. Haplogroup Q-M3 is one of the Y-Chromosome haplogroups linked to the indigenous peoples of the Americas (over 90% of indigenous people in Meso & South America). Today, such lineages also include other Q-M242 branches (Q-M346, Q-L54, Q-P89.1, Q-NWT01, and Q-Z780), haplogroup C-M130 branches (C-M217 and C-P39), and R-M207, which are almost exclusively found in the North America. Haplogroup Q-M3 is defined by the presence of the (M3) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Q-M3 occurred on the Q-L54 lineage roughly 10-15 thousand years ago as the migration into the Americas was underway. There is some debate as to on which side of the Bering Strait this mutation occurred, but it definitely happened in the ancestors of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Populations carrying Q-M3 are widespread throughout the Americas. Since the discovery of Q-M3, several subclades of Q-M3 bearing populations have been discovered in the Americas as well. An example is in South America where some populations have a high prevalence of SNP M19 which defines subclade Q-M19. M19 has been detected in 59% of Amazonian Ticuna men and in 10% of Wayuu men. Subclades Q-M19 and Q-M199 appear to be unique to South American populations and suggests that population isolation and perhaps even the establishment of tribes began soon after migration into the Americas. The Kennewick Man has a Y chromosome that belongs to the most common sub-clade Q1b1a1a-M3 while the Anzick's Y chromosome belongs to the minor Q1b1a2-M971 lineage. Q-M3 is present in some Siberian populations in Asia. It is unclear whether these are remnants of the founding lineage or evidence of back-migrations from Beringia to East Asia. The Q-M3 lineage has not been detected in the European population. Q-M19 M19 This lineage is found among Indigenous South Americans, such as the Ticuna and the Wayuu. Origin: South America approximately 5,000 to 10,000 years ago. Q-M194 It has only been found in South American populations. Q-M199 This lineage has only been found in South American populations. Q-PAGES104 This lineage was discovered by the research group at the Whitehead Institute headed by Dr. David C. Page. Only limited demographic information is known. Q-PAGES131 This lineage was discovered by the research group at the Whitehead Institute headed by Dr. David C. Page. Only limited demographic information is known. Q-L663 This lineage was discovered by citizen scientists. It is linked to indigenous populations in Central Mexico and has been associated with the Otomies (Hñähñús, as they self-identify) from Hidalgo, Mexico (Gómez et al, 2021). Q-L663's paternal line was formed around 550 BCE. The man who is the most recent common ancestor of this line is estimated to have been born around 1250 CE. Extensive research on this haplogroup is being conducted by members of the New Mexico Genealogical Society, with at least 16 NGS Y-DNA tests as of 2023. The earliest known genealogical records for a Q-L663 descendant were for a man named Nicolás de Espinosa, a native of the Villa de los Lagos, Nueva Galicia, Mexico, who was born circa 1673.

"The Huanghai Plutus (大柴神) is a pickup truck produced and sold by Chinese automobile manufacturer SG Automotive under the Huanghai Auto marque since 2007. The first generation sold from 2007 to 2012 is a compact pickup truck, while the second generation model sold from 2012 has grown to the midsize pickup segment. The second generation model shares the platform with the Huanghai Landscape F1 SUV. The double-cab first generation Huanghai Plutus is available in 4X4 and 4X2 models, and is powered by an Isuzu-derived 4JB1T 2,771 cc diesel turbo engine that makes 100hp and 230 Nm of torque at 2,200 rpm. No automatic transmission was available for the Huanghai Plutus and the sole transmission option is a five-speed manual. A variant called the Huanghai Steed (Aojun, 傲骏) is also available featuring a restyled front fascia. The standard Huanghai Plutus model in Malaysia includes ABS, EBD, driver’s airbag, MP3CD player, fog lamps, power windows, electric wing mirrors and reverse sensor. The first generation Plutus is priced at RM61,923.60 for the 4X2 and RM70,923.60 for the 4X4 model. The warranty is at just two years or 60,000km. The PMC Premio Max is the Huanghai Plutus Classic sold in Vietnam with different badging. The truck was assembled in Vietnam by Mekong Auto, a joint venture between the Unification Church and North Korea. The Huanghai Plutus was also sold as the Effa Plutus by Effa Motors in Uruguay and Brazil. Styling of the pre-facelift first generation Huanghai Plutus has been controversial as the exterior design is heavily resembling the first generation Chevrolet Colorado. The post-facelift first generation model has a revised front end that resembles the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado instead. The second generation Huanghai Plutus (大柴神) is essentially the pickup version of the Huanghai Landscape F1 SUV, sharing the same platform and same front fascia design. It was launched in May 2012. The second generation Plutus is available with a 2.4 liter gasoline engine and a 3.2 liter turbo diesel engine. The 3.2 liter inline-4 turbo diesel engine is supplied by FAW Dachai and produces a maximum power of 107hp（79kW）at 3200rpm and a maximum torque of 245N·m at 2000rpm.

"The Bayport Container Terminal, or simply the Bayport Terminal, is a major deep water port in the Greater Houston area in Texas (United States). This relatively new terminal, part of the Port of Houston, is designed to handle standardized cargo containers and offload the nearby Barbours Cut Terminal, which has no further room for expansion. The Bayport Terminal is situated along the Bayport Ship Channel off Galveston Bay, between La Porte, Texas and Seabrook, Texas adjacent to Shoreacres. This channel itself feeds into the larger Houston Ship Channel, which runs from Houston, through Galveston Bay, to the Gulf of Mexico. The port sits adjacent to the Bayport Industrial District, a large complex of firms primarily involved in petroleum and petrochemical processing. The facilities at Bayport formerly included a cruise ship terminal, built at a cost of US$81 million. The terminal briefly saw use for cruises following Hurricane Ike when ships like Carnival Cruise Lines Ecstasy and Conquest were re-routed from the damaged Port of Galveston to Bayport for nearly two months. Bayport Cruise Terminal was a planned port of call for both Princess Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line in 2013-2014. The cruise ships have since abandoned the terminal and the Port of Houston has dismantled the gangways. The Bayport Terminal was controversial since before its construction due to concerns raised about environmental impact and the general suitability of the site. The United States Army Corps of Engineers approved the permit, but stated in the Environmental Impact Statement that unavoidable impacts of increased noise in the area, increased levels of nitrous oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and cancer causing particulate matter would be emitted by the terminal. Homes are within 600 feet (180m) of the docks. Due to the prevailing southeast wind and the proximity of the residents, the Corps of Engineers recommended a 30-foot (9.1m) sound wall to block sound levels that they estimated to be as high as 70 dBA (as of 2010 the terminal was only approximately 30% in operation yet produced levels of 65 dBA). The Port of Houston approached residents who are affected by the pollution and noise and has attempted to buy an easement from these residents. In 2010, the mayor of Shoreacres published a letter to the community raising concerns about the scope of the easement and rights residents might be waiving by accepting it. That same year residents of Shoreacres filed suit against the Port of Houston Authority for damages.

"Shorashim (Hebrew: שָׁרָשִׁים, שורשים, lit. Roots) is a community settlement in northern Israel. Located in the lower Galilee and affiliated with the Conservative movement, it falls under the jurisdiction of Misgav Regional Council. In 2021 its population was 567. Shorashim was established as a moshav in 1985 by a group of North American immigrants who had formed a gar'in in 1980. Over the years, it was privatized, but the community remains tightly knit and committed to a traditional but pluralistic way of life. All community activity is voluntary. About half of the residents are native Israeli and the rest new immigrants from various countries, predominantly English speakers. The community was founded as an economic collective (MOSHAV SHITUFI) in 1980 by a group of immigrants (OLIM) from English-speaking countries and native-born Israelis. In 1992, the community privatized and today operates as a yishuv kehilati (cooperative community). The community is home to more than 130 families. It is focused on growth and seeks new families to be a part of an active, vibrant community. As many of the founding residents are immigrants, they understand the immigrant experience. Some have no extended family in Israel, so neighbors are not only friends, but family and support system, celebrating life cycle events, Shabbat, and holidays together. For many native-born Israelis, Shorashim is the gathering place for relatives from around the country. Committees of volunteers oversee nearly every aspect of community life from general administration to the nursery schools, holidays, library, and the synagogue. A number of community-wide social and cultural events throughout the year are coordinated by volunteers (for example, annual Yom HazikaronYom Ha’atzma’ut activity, 1st grade-12th grade party). Shorashim’s affiliation with the Masorti (Conservative) movement goes back to its founding. Religious services are led by the members of the community (volunteers!) every Friday evening, Shabbat morning, and all holidays. Services are egalitarian, with men and women participating fully in all aspects of synagogue ritual. On holidays, to complement religious services and study sessions, there are social and cultural activities ranging from communal potluck meals to parties. Nursery, preschool, and kindergarten for children ages three months to six years are located on Shorashim. There is a longer-day option too. There are several elementary school options for children who live on Shorashim. The majority attend a government-operated school (“public”) in the Misgav Regional Council center; others attend the Arab-Jewish school (also a government school), an anthroposophic (Waldorf) school, or a government-run religious school. Shorashim’s high schoolers generally attend the award-winning Misgav Regional Community High School. Transportation is provided to and from area elementary and secondary schools. Shorashim is about a seven-minute drive from the Misgav Regional Council center. The Regional Council offers a range of afterschool activities (including sports, art, and music) for children in all grades. Regional Council buses shuttle the children to and from their activities throughout the afternoon and evening. Children from 3rd grade through high school can participate in the local chapter of the Ihud Hahaklai youth movement, which is coordinated by the community’s youth director. They also participate in NOAM, the Masorti movement youth movement. The youth advisor is assisted by junior and senior counselors (high schoolers from Shorashim). Shorashim is part of the Misgav Regional Council, which consists of 35 Jewish and Bedouin villages sprawling over approximately 5,000 acres of the Western Galilee. It sits on Route 784 in the hills of the Western Galilee, nearly equidistant between the Misgav Regional Council and Karmiel, a city of approximately 60,000. (A regional council is similar to a county.) In addition to supporting the educational system and operating bus transportation, the Regional Council provides trash collection and other municipal services to Shorashim. The Regional Council center houses Council offices, schools (elementary through high school), health clinics, social services, parks, a community center, and a healthfitness club. Activities such as folk dancing, sports, lectures, and dancechoirtheater performances are available to all Misgav residents. Clinics from two of Israel’s larger health funds, Clalit and Maccabi, are located at the Misgav Regional Council center. Services at the clinics include family doctors and some specialists, nurses, physical therapists, pharmacy, social services, and a dental office. Government offices, banks, retail centers, supermarkets, restaurants, and larger medical clinics can all be found in Karmiel. The city’s cultural center sponsors professional theater, dance, cultural events, and performances by the Israeli Philharmonic. It also hosts an international dance festival each summer. From Shorashim, it is a 15-minute drive to the center of Karmiel, about 25 minutes to Tefen, and about 45 minutes to Yokneam and Haifa. The nearest train station is located in Karmiel. There are direct trains to Tel Aviv (a 1.5 hour train ride) and other locations throughout Israel. Shorashim has playgrounds, a basketball court, scenic hiking and walking trails, and landscaped pathways planted with indigenous trees such as olive and carob that give Shorashim a Galilee flair. As with other outlying communities in Israel, a car (or two) is a necessity. There are direct buses to Haifa, Tel Aviv, and Jerusalem from the main Karmiel-Misgav road that runs below Shorashim, and there is limited public transportation that comes into Shorashim itself. Most residents drive to work, shopping, medical appointments, and cultural and sports activities.",Normal
"The Ortolani test is part of the physical examination for developmental dysplasia of the hip, along with the Barlow maneuver. Specifically, the Ortolani test is positive when a posterior dislocation of the hip is reducible with this maneuver. This is part of the standard infant exam performed preferably in early infancy.The Ortolani test is named after Marino Ortolani, who developed it in 1937. The Ortolani test is performed with the Barlow maneuver and inspection of the hip joint and legs. It relocates the dislocation of the hip joint that has just been elicited by the Barlow maneuver. The Ortolani test is performed by an examiner first flexing the hips and knees of a supine infant to 90°, then with the examiner's index fingers placing anterior pressure on the greater trochanters, gently and smoothly abducting the infant's legs using the examiner's thumbs. A positive sign is a distinctive 'clunk' which can be heard and felt as the femoral head relocates anteriorly into the acetabulum: This medical sign article is a stub.

"Opus is a Japanese seinen manga series written and illustrated by Satoshi Kon. The story is about a manga artist who is pulled into the world of the manga he is concluding and forced to confront his characters. The manga was serialized in the manga magazine Comic Guys from October 1995 until the magazine's cancellation in June 1996. It was collected into two volumes by Tokuma Shoten on December 13, 2010 and included a missing ending found after Kon's death. Dark Horse Comics licensed the manga in North America and released it in an omnibus edition on December 9, 2014. The French edition of the manga won the 2013 Asia Critics Prize from the Association des Critiques et des journalistes de Bande Dessinée and was nominated for the Sélection Officiele at the 2014 Angoulême International Comics Festival. Opus was Kon's final manga before he debuted in the anime industry with Perfect Blue. Manga artist Chikara Nagai is in the process of ending his current serial, Resonance, by having the heroine, investigator and telepath Satoko Miura, fight the brainwashing cult leader of the ""Nameless Faith"", the Masque, and having the esper Lin sacrifice himself to defeat the Masque. While working late to meet his deadline, he encounters the angry Lin stealing the two-page spread of his death and Nagai is sucked into his manga in the middle of a fight between Satoko and the Masque. She helps him escape, but meanwhile, the Masque brainwashes Chief Hanamura of the Special Forces to find them. When Lin finds the Masque, they fight outside of the boundaries of the manga that were drawn, revealing cracks that lead to other pages. When the chief finds Satoko, Lin attempts to escape through a crack with her, but Satoko is shot in the process. Nagai falls through the bottom of the world and ends up back in the real world, but finds that he cannot draw Lin and finish the final spread. Frustrated, he breaks into the sketch of an alternate ending, rescuing Satoko from being shot by the chief and bringing her into the real world. Satoko explores the area and while reading the manga about her, finds Lin appearing in an earlier volume. From her experience, she determines that Nagai's world is just as cruel as hers and they resolve to save her world. When they go back, they find that the manga's world is disintegrating and the Masque and Hanamura try to kill them again. The world disappears, save for Nagai. He finds Lin's sister Mei, who gives him his lost pen, and he redraws Satoko. They travel back to the first volume of Resonance, where Satoko was the target of a serial killer, but was saved by the police detective and telepath Sawamura, who died in the process and was reincarnated as Lin. Nagai suggests that they avoid interfering with the story, but when they interact with characters from the world, cracks start forming. Lin finds the killer, the precursor to the Masque, and tries to kill him, but is stopped by Nagai and Satoko. After the younger Satoko is kidnapped, the group and a wounded Sawamura try to save her. The killer finds a copy of Resonance and foresees an ambush by Sawamura, killing him. Lin is shot while trying to stop him but kills the serial killer, releasing the older Masque who had hidden inside his body. The freed Masque takes control of the world and the party falls into the world of the second volume. Unable to do anything, the group continues falling as Nagai declares that it is ""the end."" Satoshi Kon, the artist of Opus, is informed of the cancellation of ""Comic Guard"" magazine and laments the fact that he could have finished the story in three chapters. Later, he calls his editor and tells him about a final chapter he is working on for an abrupt ending, but can't draw it because he is busy with Perfect Blue. Nagai appears out of the chapter and admonishes him for not completing his story, offering ideas for getting it published. Kon's wife arrives home and screams at the sight of Nagai. The manga was serialized in Gakken's bi-monthly manga magazine Comic Guys starting in October 1995 until the cancellation of the magazine in June 1996. As Kon started working on Perfect Blue and focusing on his anime career, Opus was put on permanent hiatus and Kon later came to refer to it as a failure. Tokuma Shoten collected the 19 chapters into two volumes published on December 13, 2010 under its Ryu Comics imprint, adding a missing ending found after Kon's death. The final chapter, found in Kon's files, was never finished or published and was included by the publisher to help readers ""understand the intent of the story"". During Sakura-Con 2014, Dark Horse Comics announced that it had licensed the manga and would compile it in omnibus format, subsequently publishing it on December 9, 2014. In April 2012, Kon's widow Kyōko announced that Opus would be sold in French, Italian, and Korean. The manga has been released in France by Éditions IMHO, in Italy by Panini Comics, in Korea by Daewon C.I., in Germany by Carlsen Comics, and in Spain by Planeta de Libros. At Japan Expo 2017, producer Masao Maruyama of Studio M2 expressed an unofficial wish to produce an anime adaptation of the manga with his studio. Susumu Hirasawa, a composer who frequently worked on Kon's films, stated on Twitter in October 2017 that he was asked to work on a theme song for the series. However, it was not clear whether he was referring to Maruyama's desired project, as no announcements have been made for an anime adaptation of Opus. MangaBlog's Brigid Alverson found the action hard to follow which pulled her out of the story, while Katherine Dacey said that she ""normally find these kind of meta-exercises tedious, but Kon infuses the story with a sense of playful urgency that thwarts the urge to deconstruct every page."" The Fandom Post complimented Kon's use of metafiction as part of a story ""rife with questions of existentialism and predestination"". Paul Gravett listed it number one on his top ten manga of 2014 and called Opus a ""mind-blowing meta-manga"" that is ""overflowing with ideas and imagination"", adding that it shares much in common with Kon's films and would have made a good anime adaption. The Comics Journal said that the plot is ""as 'Satoshi Kon' a scenario as can possibly be imagined"" and noted the goal of the title in ""reaching for the stars"". The French edition of the manga won the 2013 Asia Critics Prize from the Association des Critiques et des journalistes de Bande Dessinée and was part of the Sélection Officiele at the 2014 Angoulême International Comics Festival. It was also on the 2016 Young Adult Library Services Association's Great Graphic Novels for Teens List.",Normal
"Blaxland is a town in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. Blaxland is located 65 kilometres west of Sydney in the local government area of the City of Blue Mountains. It is at an altitude of 234 metres and borders the townships of Glenbrook, Mount Riverview and Warrimoo. Blaxland is named for Gregory Blaxland who along with William Lawson and William Wentworth, led the exploration that discovered a route over the Blue Mountains in 1813. Prior to 1879 the area was known as Wascoe. The Pilgrim Inn was built c. 1825. It was a significant element in the area for some time, but eventually decayed. The remains, which are now adjacent to McDonald's, are heritage-listed. The Rev. Joshua Hargrave became a major presence in the area in the early 20th. century, and a significant force in the growth of Blaxland as a village, especially South Blaxland. He built the first church in the area and, with his family and the Calver family, is associated with four homes that still survive: Tanfield in Hope Street, Menahne in Hope Street, Rosedale in View Street and Nardi in View Street. The homes are all heritage-listed. Blaxland has a number of heritage listed sites, including: According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 7,451 people in Blaxland. In the 2021 Census religious affiliation was as follows: Blaxland railway station is on the Blue Mountains Line of the NSW TrainLink intercity network. It is a disability-accessible station. The village of Blaxland received a major overhaul in 2001 with the widening of the Great Western Highway. This work included the controversial planting of Canary Island Palm trees along the highway, but also created space for more shops and led to many refurbishments. These changes, combined with the upgrade of Blaxland Station, have improved business in Blaxland. Blaxland also has a small industrial estate and the only remaining land fill waste facility in the Blue Mountains. Blaxland includes the Florabella Pass and Pippas Pass tracks. The Lennox Bridge (Lapstone Hill) and Knapsack Viaduct could be approached via Mitchell's Pass, but do further investigation if planning to hike some or all of the way there. It is home to the Blaxland Redbacks soccer and netball teams. The Soccer team was established in 1965 and resides at the home ground of St. Johns Oval, Blaxland. St. Johns Oval was named after the local St. Johns Ambulance Brigade who original donated the land for the soccer fields to the club. The Wascoe Siding is a Miniature Railway was established in 1964 by John Green. It is a conversion of a disused railway cutting from the railway line for Glenbrook Station, then named Wascoe Siding.

"Urnes Stave Church (Norwegian: Urnes stavkyrkje) is a 12th-century stave church at Ornes, along the Lustrafjorden in the municipality of Luster in Vestland county, Norway. The church sits on the eastern side of the fjord, directly across the fjord from the village of Solvorn and about five kilometres (3mi) east of the village of Hafslo. It is among the oldest stave churches in Norway, with parts of the lumber construction dating from the latter half of the 11th century. The church was built in a long church basilica plan inspired by medieval Christian churches, with cylindrical columns and semi-circular arches inside. The decoration on capitals of the columns and outside of the church embodies the visual evidence of the Viking culture’s transformation, assimilation, and adoption of Christianity. The north portal of the church is defined as the Urnes style, which contains decorations derived from Norwegian mythology dating back to the 12th century. It has been owned by Fortidsminneforeningen (Society for the Preservation of Norwegian Ancient Monuments) since 1881. In 1979, the Urnes Stave Church was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Stave churches in Norway can be dated back to 10th–11th century. Stave churches are wooden buildings in a three-dimensional cubic structure covered with wall planks; the frame of the overall structure is constructed with timber balks and the wall planks are fitted into the frames where convenient. The word ""Stave"" (Norwegian: Stav) means sturdy wood columns that are the corner posts and columns which uphold the overall architectural structure. The Stave Style can be defined as using the upright wall planks. The Urnes Stave Church was built around the year 1130 or shortly thereafter, and still stands in its original location; it is believed to be the oldest of its kind. The 1956 excavation revealed that there are two prior churches built on the same site. The first church was built during the period of transition to Christianity in the palisade style, in which structural members were embedded into the ground. The second one was built in the latter half of the 11th century. Both of them were small structures with the nave-and-chancel design. In the middle of the 12th century, the second church was torn down; the third church, based on some part of the second one, was vastly different from it. It incorporated a central section of nave which is higher above the rest of the building; the framework contains 16 large staves, and defines nave and surrounding aisles. The roof of the central compartment is 2 metres (6ft 7in) higher than the roof of aisles. This design was immensely popular at the time and served as inspiration for later stave churches. It provides a link between Christian architecture and the architecture and art forms of the Viking Age with typical animal-ornamentation, the so-called ""Urnes style"" of animal-art. The entirely wooden churches were built on the classic basilica plan. The main inspiration of the plan was the basilica style of cathedrals in European Christian churches, and the inspiration of the framing the roof lined with boards and the roof covered with shingles was a prevalent architectural technique in Scandinavian countries. The cylindrical columns with cubic capitals and semi-circular arches in the church revealed the borrowing from the spatial structures of Romanesque stone architecture. In the 17th century the nave of the church, which is a raised central room surrounded by an aisle, was extended southwards. Other elements were also added to the church, including a baptismal font (1640), a wooden canopy above the altar (1665) and a pulpit (1693–1695). The altarpiece, which depicts Christ on the cross with the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist, dates from 1699. Windows were added to the church in the 18th century. The decorations on the outside of the Urnes Stave Church, including wood carvings and sculpted decor, serve as visual evidence of the Viking culture's transformation, assimilation, and adoption of Christianity. Strap-work panels were taken from the previous 11th century Urnes Church and then incorporated into the new structure, keeping elements of Viking tradition alive. The carved decoration of the North Portal, depicting interlaced animals, in this Urnes-style context is one of the last examples of Viking animal ornamentation. The interior of the church is more richly decorated than the exterior. The structure is partly held up by a series of 12th century wooden columns. At the top of the columns, the capitals are decorated with carvings of human, animal, and vegetal motifs. Some of these capitals contain simple abstracted figures while some contain the traditional interlacing design of the Viking tradition. The Urnes Stave Church is also home to numerous medieval liturgical objects for public worship. The portal and other details of the north wall of the present church, as well as the wall planks of the gables, are decorated in classic Urnes-style. They are probably relics from one of the earlier churches. It has been speculated that the portal may originally have been the main portal, facing west. In mythology and religions, the portal is meant to let people enter into God's house. In a Christian sense, the portals are the symbolic embodiment in the mortal world of the chaos and struggle with evil in daily life. Here, the struggle between the serpent with the great beast, as shown in the portal at Urnes, represents the onset of Ragnarok. It is possible that the decoration of the earlier church featured some scenes from Norse mythology, a likely reason for its premature reconstruction in the 12th century. In this context, the animal may be interpreted as Níðhöggr eating the roots of Yggdrasil. ""The intertwined snakes and dragons represent the end of the world according to the Norse legend of Ragnarök"". The Urnes style doorway with carved whorls of writhing snakes and vines, in a welter of elongated animals and plants reduced to vines. The most important point of the huge tangle is to present the intertwinedness itself of all living things, animal or vegetable. On the right hand side, about one-third of the way from the bottom a serpent is even emitting a fleur-de-lis from its mouth. The visual characteristic is often referred to by art historians as the Urnes style. The church is built with a rectangular nave and a narrower choir. The nave and choir both have raised central spaces. The choir was extended to the east in the 17th century, but this addition was later removed. The drawing by Johan Christian Dahl depicts this, as well as the deteriorated state of the church at that time. During the 20th century the church underwent a restoration, and the richly decorated wall planks were covered to stop further deterioration. A large number of medieval constructive elements remain in situ: ground beams (grunnstokker), sills (sviller), corner posts (hjørnestolper), wall planks (veggtiler) and aisle wall plates (stavlægjer). The construction of the raised central area with staves, strings and cross braces, and the roof itself, also date from medieval times. From the previous church on the site remain, in addition to the portal, two wall planks in the northern wall, the corner post of the choir, the western gable of the nave and the eastern gable of the choir. The church has not been in ordinary use since 1881, when the parish of Urnes was abolished, and it became a part of Solvorn parish in the Sogn prosti (deanery) of the Diocese of Bjørgvin. It is now only used for special occasions in the parish such as baptisms and weddings. Interventions to the church building for religious and practical needs have been carried over the centuries. These interventions are still clearly visible; they have provided authentic testimony to social life and religious practices in Norway. Now, Urnes Stave Church is one of the most popular tourist sites in Norway.",Normal

"SPAMasterpiece Theater (or S.P.A.M. Theater) is an American web series starring humorist John Hodgman where he does dramatic readings of unsolicited email spam received by Boing Boing editors in a parody of Masterpiece Theatre. The series featured images and videos from Creative Commons-licensed media. In 2008, S.P.A.M. Theater debuted. Each episode features a dramatization of email spam. Originally, the series featured images and videos from Creative Commons-licensed media from the image hosting and video hosting website Flickr and the nonprofit digital library Internet Archive. The second episode ""FOR MY DAUGHTER'S SAKEDE@L OF A LIFETIME"" featured the voices of Russ Gooberman and Dana Devonshire. In the third episode ""Love Song of Kseniya,"" Boing Boing's Xeni Jardin reads her own email spam. In the fourth episode ""The Proposition,"" Erik Sheppard of Voice Talent Productions contributes a voice. On October 1, 2008, Jardin announced the official debut of the web series SPAMasterpiece Theater—almost a month before the American release of John Hodgman's satirical almanac More Information Than You Require. Hodgman described it as ""true tale of romance, adventure, infamy, and low-cost prescription drugs, all culled from the reams of actual, unsolicited emails, received here by us and people like you -- what we call SPAM."" The hosted series included dramatic readings by Hodgman in a parody of Masterpiece Theatre. In 2010, Boing Boing Video's Jardin was picked as ""Curator of the Month"". She commended the series with ""These were so much fun to put together."" The first four SPAMasterpiece Theater episodes opened with a chiptune remix of Jean-Joseph Mouret's ""Rondeau: Fanfare"" (1735) by Hamhocks Buttermilk Johnson. Vulture's Matthew Perpetua praised the series with ""Hodgman's deadpan delivery is typically excellent, but we're particularly fond of the deliberately pretentious juxtaposition of stock footage in the dramatizations. PBS might want to look at this."" In a retrospective celebrating the anniversary of Boing Boing TV, BBC Online's web producer Ellen West described SPAMasterpiece Theater as ""It's like Adam Curtis doing a nonsense Power of Nightmares.""",Normal

"The Caspian expeditions of the Rus' were military raids undertaken by the Rus' between the late 9th century and c. 1041 on the Caspian Sea shores, of what are nowadays Iran, Dagestan, and Azerbaijan. Initially, the Rus' appeared in Serkland in the 9th century traveling as merchants along the Volga trade route, selling furs, honey, and slaves. The first small-scale Viking raids took place in the late 9th and early 10th century. The Rus' undertook the first large-scale expedition in 913; having arrived on 500 ships, they pillaged in the Gorgan region, in the territory of present-day Iran, and more to the west, in Gilan and Mazandaran, taking slaves and goods. On their return, the northern raiders were attacked and defeated by the Khazars in the Volga Delta, and those who escaped were killed by the local tribes on the middle Volga. During their next expedition in 943, the Rus' captured Bardha'a, the capital of Arran, in the modern-day Republic of Azerbaijan. The Rus' stayed there for several months, killing many inhabitants of the city and amassing substantial plunder. It was only an outbreak of dysentery among the Rus' that forced them to depart with their spoils. Sviatoslav, prince of Kiev, commanded the next attack, which destroyed the Khazar state in 965. Sviatoslav's campaign established the Rus's hold on the north-south trade routes, helping to alter the demographics of the region. Raids continued through the time period with the last Scandinavian attempt to reestablish the route to the Caspian Sea taking place in c. 1041 by Ingvar the Far-Travelled. The Rus' first penetrated to the Muslim areas adjacent to the Caspian Sea as traders rather than warriors. By the early 9th century, the Norsemen settled in northwestern Rus', where they established a settlement called Aldeigja (Slavic: Ladoga) about 6 miles (9.7km) south of the Volkhov River entry into Lake Ladoga. From there, they began trading with the Byzantine Empire along the Dnieper trade route and with the Muslim lands around the Caspian Sea along the Volga trade route. In the late 9th century, ibn Khordadbeh described the Rus' buying goods from the Khazars in the market areas on the lower Volga and selling them on the markets of Caspian towns; these merchants brought furs, honey, and slaves. Small groups of the Rus' even went on camels as far as Baghdad to sell their goods; their European slaves interpreted for them. Thomas S. Noonan suggested that the Rus' reached Baghdad as early as 800; this argument is supported by the finding of Sassanid, Arab, and Arabo-Sassanid dirham coins dated no later than 804–805 at Peterhof, near Saint-Petersburg. In ibn Khordadbeh's account, the Rus' are described as ""a kind of the Saqaliba"", a term usually used to refer to Slavs, and anti-Normanist scholars have interpreted this passage as indicative of the Rus' being Slavs rather than Scandinavians. In the interpretation of the Normanist scholars, the word Saqaliba was also frequently applied to all fair-haired, ruddy-complexioned populations of Central, Eastern, and Northeastern Europe, so ibn Khordadbeh's language is ambiguous here. The first Caspian raid of the Rus' occurred sometime in the reign of Hasan ibn Zaid, ruler of Tabaristan between 864 and 884. The Rus' sailed into the Caspian Sea and unsuccessfully attacked its eastern shore at Abaskun. This raid was probably on a very small scale. The second raid took place in 909 or 910 and was likewise aimed at Abaskun; just like the previous attack, this expedition was a minor one with only sixteen ships participating in it. The third minor raid took place in 911 or 912. The Rus' launched the first large-scale raid in 913. A fleet of 500 ships reached the southern shores of the Caspian Sea through the country of the Khazars. In order to secure a peaceful passage through the land of the Khazars, the Rus' promised the Khazars half of their spoils. They sailed down the Dnieper River into the Black Sea, then into the Sea of Azov, then up the Don River past the Khazar city of Sarkel, and then by a portage reached the Volga, which led them into the Caspian Sea. The Rus' attacked in the Gorgan region around Abaskun, as well as Tabaristan, pillaging the countrysides as they went. An attempt to repel them as they lay in anchor near islands in the southwestern part of the Caspian Sea proved unsuccessful; and they were then able to roam and raid at will. Across the sea they raided at Baku, penetrating inland a distance of three days' journey, and plundering the regions of Arran, Tabaristan, Beylagan, and Shirvan. Everywhere they looted as much as they could, taking women and children as slaves. The news of their outrages preceded them as they headed homeward and, in the Volga Delta, the Rus' were attacked by Khazars, as well as by some Christians, apparently with the acquiescence of the Khazar ruler. According to al-Masudi, those who escaped were finished off by the Burtas and Volga Bulgars. The second large-scale campaign is dated to 943, when Igor was the supreme leader of the Rus', according to the Primary Chronicle. During the 943 expedition, the Rus' rowed up the Kura River, deep into the Caucasus, defeated the forces of Marzuban bin Muhammad, and captured Bardha'a, the capital of Arran. The Rus' allowed the local people to retain their religion in exchange for recognition of their overlordship; it is possible that the Rus' intended to settle permanently there. According to ibn Miskawaih, the local people broke the peace by stone-throwing and other abuse directed against the Rus', who then demanded that the inhabitants evacuate the city. This ultimatum was rejected, and the Rus' began killing people and holding many for ransom. The slaughter was briefly interrupted for negotiations, which soon broke down. The Rus' stayed in Bardha'a for several months, using it as a base for plundering the adjacent areas, and amassed substantial spoils. The city was saved only by an outbreak of dysentery among the Rus'. Ibn Miskawaih writes that the Rus' ""indulged excessively in the fruit of which there are numerous sorts there. This produced an epidemic among them . . . and their numbers began thereby to be reduced."" Encouraged by the epidemic among the Rus', the Muslims approached the city. The Rus', their chief riding on a donkey, made an unsuccessful sally after which they lost 700 warriors, but evaded encirclement and retreated to the Bardha'a fortress, where they were besieged by the Muslims. Exhausted by the disease and the siege, the Rus' ""left by night the fortress in which they had established their quarters, carrying on their backs all they could of their treasure, gems, and fine raiment, boys and girls as they wanted, and made for the Kura River, where the ships in which they had issued from their home were in readiness with their crews, and 300 Russes whom they had been supporting with portions of their booty."" The Muslims then exhumed from the Rus' graves the weapons that had been buried beside the warriors. George Vernadsky proposed that Oleg of Novgorod was the donkey-riding chief of the Rus' who attacked Bardha'a. Vernadsky identified Oleg with Helgu, a figure mentioned in the Schechter Letter. According to that document, Helgu went to Persia by boat and died there after a failed attack on Constantinople in 941. On the other hand, Lev Gumilev, drawing on the name of the Rus' leader (as recorded in Arabian sources), hypothesizes that this leader was Sveneld, a Varangian chieftain whose wealth was noted in the Primary Chronicle under 945. The sources are not clear about the roots of the conflict between Khazaria and Rus', so several possibilities have been suggested. The Rus' had an interest in removing the Khazar hold on the Volga trade route because the Khazars collected duties from the goods transported by the Volga. Byzantine incitement also apparently played a role. Khazars were the allies of the Byzantines until the reign of Romanus I Lecapenus, who persecuted the Jews of his empire. The conflict may also have been spurred by the Khazars' decision to close passage down the Volga in response to the raid of 943. In the Khazar Correspondence, written around 950–960, the Khazar ruler Joseph reported his role as defender of the Muslim polities of the Caspian region against Rus' incursions: ""I have to wage war with them , for if I would give them any chance at all they would lay waste the whole land of the Muslims as far as Baghdad."" Earlier conflict between Muslim elements of the Khazar army and Rus' marauders in c. 912 may have contributed to this arrangement and the hostility of the Rus' against Khazaria. In 965, Sviatoslav I of Kiev finally went to war against Khazaria. He employed Oghuz and Pecheneg mercenaries in this campaign, perhaps to counter the Khazars' superior cavalry. Sviatoslav destroyed the Khazar city of Sarkel around 965, and possibly sacked (but did not occupy) the Khazar city of Kerch on the Crimea. He subsequently (probably in 968 or 969) destroyed the Khazar capital of Atil. A visitor to Atil wrote soon after Sviatoslav's campaign: ""The Rus' attacked, and no grape or raisin remained, not a leaf on a branch."" Ibn Hawqal is the only author who reports the sack of Semender, after which the Rus' departed for ""Rûm and al-Andaluz"". Sviatoslav's campaign brought the prosperity and independence of Khazaria to an abrupt end. The destruction of Khazar imperial power paved the way for Kievan Rus' to dominate north-south trade routes through the steppe and across the Black Sea, routes that formerly had been a major source of revenue for the Khazars. Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the Saltovo-Mayaki culture, greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe. In 987, Maymun, emir of Derbent, asked the Rus' to help him against local chiefs. The Rus', many of whom appear to have been professional soldiers, arrived on 18 ships. Uncertain of their reception, they sent only one ship to reconnoitre the situation. When its crew were massacred by the local population, the Rus' went on to loot the city of Maskat. In 989, this same Maymun is reported to have refused the demand of a local preacher to turn over his Rus' mercenaries to him for either conversion to Islam or death. In the ensuing struggle, Maymun was driven from the city and forced to surrender the Rus' soldiers, but he returned in 992. In 1030, the Rus' raided the region of Shirvan; the ruler of Ganja then paid them much money to help suppress a revolt in Beylagan. Afterwards, the Rus' returned home. According to one source, in November 1031 the Rus' returned, but were defeated near Baku and expelled. The year of 1032 saw another Rus' raid into Shirvan; they were joined by the Alans and Sarir. Local Muslims defeated the Rus' in 1033. It is unclear to which Rus' grouping these raiders belonged. Omeljan Pritsak suggests that they operated out of a base near the Terek estuary and had their principal home in Tmutarakan. Pritsak also speculated that the Rus', operating from the Caspian basin, shortly thereafter lent support to the Oghuz in a power struggle in Khwarezm. in 1042 Ingvar the Far-Travelled led an unsuccessful large Viking attack against Persia with a fleet of 200 ships (around 15–20 thousand men). The legendary saga Yngvars saga víðförla describes the last expedition of the Vikings into the Caspian, dated to 1041 and possibly connected with the Georgian-Byzantine Battle of Sasireti in which a Varangian force participated around the same time; in the saga much legend is conflated with the historical facts. This expedition was launched from Sweden by Ingvar the Far-Travelled, who went down the Volga into the land of the Saracens (Serkland in Norse). There are no less than twenty-six Ingvar Runestones, twenty-three of them being in the Lake Mälaren region of Uppland in Sweden, referring to Swedish warriors who went out with Ingvar on his expedition to the Saracen lands, an expedition whose purpose was probably to reopen old trade routes, now that the Bulgars and the Khazars no longer proved obstacles. A stone to Ingvar's brother indicates that he went east for gold but that he died in the Saracen land. Afterwards, no attempts were made by the Norsemen to reopen the route between the Baltic and Caspian seas. Khaqani tells about the invasion of Shirvan in 1173 or 1174. In his odes, Khaqani names the Rus' and Khazars, Rus' and Alans, Rus' and Sarir as the invaders. Peter Golden argued that the Rus' mentioned by Khaqani were Volga pirates who came in 73 ships. Yevgeni Pakhomov and Vladimir Minorsky thought the invasion was initiated by the ruler of Darbent, Bek-Bars b. Muzaffar. According to Minorsky, ""the initiative of Bek-Bars was independent of Kiev, and he must have used bands of free-lances (бродники) who were roaming in the south, as a prototype of the future Cossacks"". The shirvanshah Ahsitan I turned to the Georgian king, George III for aid and a combined army, which also included the future Byzantine emperor Andronikos Komnenos, defeated the invaders and recaptured the fortress of Shabaran. Georgian sources speak of the Khazars, but do not mention Rus' in connection with this event.",Normal

"Kunzea badjaensis is a flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to a small area of New South Wales. It is a shrub with egg-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers near the end of the branches. It grows at high altitudes on the Southern Tablelands. Kunzea badjaensis is a shrub, often a prostrate shrub, which grows to a height of about 0.2–1m (0.7–3ft) with its branches hairy when young. The leaves are egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, 2–6mm (0.08–0.2in) long and 1–3mm (0.04–0.1in) wide with a petiole 0.5–1mm (0.02–0.04in) long. The flowers are arranged in rounded heads near the ends of the branches which often continue to grow during flowering. The sepal lobes are triangular, about 1mm (0.04in) long and the petals are white, 1.0–1.5mm (0.04–0.06in) long. There are about 30-40 stamens which are 3–4mm (0.1–0.2in) long. Flowering occurs between December and January and the fruit are cup-shaped capsules which are 4mm (0.2in) long and about 3mm (0.1in) wide. Kunzea badjaensis was first formally described in 2016 by Hellmut R. Toelken and the description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The specific epithet (badjaensis) is a reference to Big Badja Hill, one of the places where this species is found. It had previously been known as Kunzea sp. Wadbilliga (Rodd 6168). This kunzea grows in heath on the tablelands at altitudes over 1,000m (3,000ft), mainly in the Kybean Range. Most individuals of K. badjaensis are low shrubs but a particularly low-growing form has been registered as a cultivar known as Kunzea 'Badja Carpet'. This horticultural form grows best in well-drained soil in a sunny position.",Normal

"Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous – Shoemaker (NEAR Shoemaker), renamed after its 1996 launch in honor of planetary scientist Eugene Shoemaker, was a robotic space probe designed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory for NASA to study the near-Earth asteroid Eros from close orbit over a period of a year. It was the first spacecraft to orbit an asteroid and land on it successfully. In February 2000, the mission closed in on the asteroid and orbited it. On February 12, 2001, Shoemaker touched down on the asteroid and was terminated just over two weeks later. The primary scientific objective of NEAR was to return data on the bulk properties, composition, mineralogy, morphology, internal mass distribution, and magnetic field of Eros. Secondary objectives include studies of regolith properties, interactions with the solar wind, possible current activity as indicated by dust or gas, and the asteroid spin state. This data was used to help understand the characteristics of asteroids in general, their relationship to meteoroids and comets, and the conditions in the early Solar System. To accomplish these goals, the spacecraft was equipped with an X-raygamma-ray spectrometer, a near-infrared imaging spectrograph, a multi-spectral camera fitted with a CCD imaging detector, a laser rangefinder, and a magnetometer. A radio science experiment was also performed using the NEAR tracking system to estimate the gravity field of the asteroid. The total mass of the instruments was 56kg (123lb), requiring 80 watts of power. NEAR was the first robotic space probe built by Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). A previous plan for the mission was for it to go to 4660 Nereus and do a flyby of 2019 van Albada en route. In January 2000, it would rendezvous with Nereus, but instead of staying, it would visit multiple asteroids and comets. Some of the choices that were discussed were 2PEncke, 433 Eros (which became the mission's primary target), 1036 Ganymed, 4 Vesta, and 4015 Wilson–Harrington. The Small-Body Grand Tour was a plan to visit two asteroids and two comets over a decade with the spacecraft. The mission's primary goal was to study the near-Earth asteroid 433 Eros from orbit for approximately one year. Eros is an S-type asteroid approximately 13 × 13 × 33km in size, the second largest near-Earth asteroid. Initially, the orbit was circular with a radius of 200km. The orbit radius was brought down in stages to a 50 × 50km orbit on April 30, 2000, and decreased to 35 × 35km on July 14, 2000. The orbit was raised over succeeding months to a 200 × 200km orbit and then slowly decreased and altered to a 35 × 35km retrograde orbit on December 13, 2000. The mission ended with a touchdown in Eros's ""saddle"" region on February 12, 2001. Some scientists claim that the mission's ultimate goal was to link Eros, an asteroidal body, to meteorites recovered on Earth. With sufficient data on chemical composition, a causal link could be established between Eros and other S-type asteroids, and those meteorites believed to be pieces of S-type asteroids (perhaps Eros itself). Once this connection is established, meteorite material can be studied with large, complex, and evolving equipment, and the results can be extrapolated to bodies in space. NEAR did not prove or disprove this link to the satisfaction of scientists. Between December 1999 and February 2001, NEAR used its gamma-ray spectrometer to detect gamma-ray bursts as part of the InterPlanetary Network. After launching on a Delta 7925-8 (a Delta II launch vehicle with nine strap-on solid-rocket boosters and a Star 48 (PAM-D) third stage) on February 17, 1996, and exited from Earth orbit, NEAR entered the first part of its cruise phase. NEAR spent most of the cruise phase in a minimal activity ""hibernation"" state, which ended a few days before the flyby of the 61km diameter asteroid 253 Mathilde. On June 27, 1997, NEAR flew by Mathilde within 1200km at 12:56 UT at 9.93kms, returning imaging and other instrument data. The flyby produced over 500 images, covering 60% of Mathilde's surface, as well as gravitational data allowing calculations of Mathilde's dimensions and mass. On July 3, 1997, NEAR executed the first major deep space maneuver, a two-part burn of the main 450N thruster. This decreased the velocity by 279ms and lowered perihelion from 0.99AU to 0.95AU. The Earth gravity assist swingby occurred on January 23, 1998, at 7:23 UT. The closest approach was 540km, altering the orbital inclination from 0.5 to 10.2degrees and the aphelion distance from 2.17 to 1.77AU, nearly matching those of Eros. Instrumentation was active at this time. The first of four scheduled rendezvous burns was attempted on December 20, 1998, at 22:00 UT. The burn sequence was initiated but immediately aborted. The spacecraft subsequently entered safe mode and began tumbling. The spacecraft's thrusters fired thousands of times during the anomaly, which expended 29kg of propellant, reducing the program's propellant margin to zero. This anomaly almost resulted in the loss of the spacecraft due to a lack of solar orientation and subsequent battery drain. Contact between the spacecraft and mission control could not be established for over 24 hours. The root cause of this incident has not been determined, but software and operational errors contributed to the severity of the anomaly. The original mission plan called for the four burns to be followed by an orbit insertion burn on January 10, 1999, but the abort of the first burn and loss of communication made this impossible. A new plan was put into effect in which NEAR flew by Eros on December 23, 1998, at 18:41:23 UT at a speed of 965ms and a distance of 3827km from the center of mass of Eros. The camera took images of Eros, data were collected by the near IR spectrograph, and radio tracking was performed during the flyby. A rendezvous maneuver was performed on January 3, 1999, involving a thruster burn to match NEAR's orbital speed to that of Eros. A hydrazine thruster burn took place on January 20 to fine-tune the trajectory. On August 12, a two-minute thruster burn slowed the spacecraft velocity relative to Eros to 300kmh. Orbital insertion around Eros occurred on February 14, 2000, at 15:33 UT (10:33 EST) after NEAR completed a 13-month heliocentric orbit which closely matched the orbit of Eros. A rendezvous maneuver was completed on February 3 at 17:00 UT, slowing the spacecraft from 19.3 to 8.1ms relative to Eros. Another maneuver took place on February 8, increasing the relative velocity slightly to 9.9ms. Searches for satellites of Eros took place on January 28 and February 4, and 9; none were found. The scans were for scientific purposes and to mitigate any possible collision with a satellite. NEAR went into a 321×366km elliptical orbit around Eros on February 14. The orbit was slowly decreased to a 35km circular polar orbit by July 14. NEAR remained in this orbit for ten days and then was backed out in stages to a 100km circular orbit by September 5, 2000. Maneuvers in mid-October led to a flyby of Eros within 5.3km of the surface at 07:00 UT on October 26. Following the flyby, NEAR moved to a 200km circular orbit and shifted the orbit from prograde near-polar to a retrograde near-equatorial orbit. By December 13, 2000, the orbit was shifted back to a circular 35km low orbit. Starting on January 24, 2001, the spacecraft began a series of close passes (5 to 6km) to the surface and, on January 28, passed 2 to 3km from the asteroid. The spacecraft then made a slow controlled descent to the surface of Eros, ending with a touchdown just to the south of the saddle-shaped feature Himeros on February 12, 2001, at approximately 20:01 UT (3:01p.m. EST). To the surprise of the controllers, the spacecraft was undamaged and operational after the landing at an estimated speed of 1.5 to 1.8meters per second (thus becoming the first spacecraft to soft-land on an asteroid). After receiving an extension of antenna time on the Deep Space Network, the spacecraft's gamma-ray spectrometer was reprogrammed to collect data on Eros's composition from a vantage point about 4 inches (100mm) from the surface where it was ten times more sensitive than when it was used in orbit. This increase in sensitivity was in part due to the increased ratio of the signal from Eros compared to the noise generated by the probe itself. The impact of cosmic rays on the sensor was also reduced by about 50%. At 7 p.m. EST on February 28, 2001, the last data signals were received from NEAR Shoemaker before it was shut down. A final attempt to communicate with the spacecraft on December 10, 2002, was unsuccessful. This was likely due to the extreme −279°F (−173°C, 100 K) conditions the probe experienced while on Eros. The spacecraft has the shape of an octagonal prism, approximately 1.7 m on a side, with four fixed gallium arsenide solar panels in a windmill arrangement, a fixed 1.5 m X-band high-gain radio antenna with a magnetometer mounted on the antenna feed, and an X-ray solar monitor on one end (the forward deck), with the other instruments fixed on the opposite end (the aft deck). Most electronics were mounted on the inside of the decks. The propulsion module was contained in the interior. The decision to mount instruments on the body of the spacecraft rather than using booms resulted in the gamma-ray spectrometer needing to be shielded from noise generated by the craft. A bismuth germanate shield was used, although this proved only moderately effective. The craft was three-axis stabilized and used a single bipropellant (hydrazine nitrogen tetroxide) 450 newton (N) main thruster, and four 21N and seven 3.5N hydrazine thrusters for propulsion, for a total delta-V potential of 1450ms. Attitude control was achieved using the hydrazine thrusters and four reaction wheels. The propulsion system carried 209kg of hydrazine and 109kg of NTO oxidizer in two oxidizer and three fuel tanks. Power was provided by four 1.8 by 1.2meter gallium arsenide solar panels, which could produce 400watts at 2.2AU (329,000,000km), NEAR's maximum distance from the Sun and 1800 watts at one AU (150,000,000km). Power was stored in a nine-ampere-hour, 22-cell rechargeable super nickel-cadmium battery. Spacecraft guidance was achieved through the use of a sensor suite of five digital solar attitude detectors, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and a star tracker camera pointed opposite the instrument pointing direction. The IMU contained hemispherical resonators gyroscopes and accelerometers. Four reaction wheels (arranged so that any three can provide complete three-axis control) were used for normal attitude control. The thrusters were used to dump angular momentum from the reaction wheels, as well as for rapid slew and propulsive maneuvers. Attitude control was to 0.1 degree, line-of-sight pointing stability is within 50 microradians over one second, and post-processing attitude knowledge is to 50 microradians. The command and data handling subsystem was composed of two redundant command and telemetry processors and solid state recorders, a power switching unit, and an interface to two redundant 1553 standard data buses for communications with other subsystems. NEAR was the first APL spacecraft to use significant numbers of plastic encapsulated microcircuits (PEMs), and the first to use solid-state data recorders for mass storage—previous APL spacecraft used magnetic tape recorders or magnetic cores. The solid-state recorders are constructed from 16 Mbit IBM Luna-C DRAMs. One recorder has 1.1 gigabits of storage, and the other has 0.67 gigabits. The NEAR mission was the first launch of NASA's Discovery Program, a series of small-scale spacecraft designed to proceed from development to flight in under three years for a cost of less than $150 million. The construction, launch, and 30-day cost for this mission is estimated at $122 million. The final total mission cost was $224 million, which consisted of $124.9 million for spacecraft development, $44.6 million for launch support and tracking, and $54.6 million for mission operations and data analysis.

"KDUS (1060 AM) is a commercial radio station licensed to Tempe, Arizona, and serving the Phoenix metropolitan area. It airs a sports radio format and is an affiliate of the SportsMap network. It is owned by Hubbard Broadcasting, Inc., with the license held by Phoenix FCC License Sub, LLC. Its studios are on North 52nd Street west of Papago Park. By day, KDUS is powered at 5,000 watts non-directional. But 1060 AM is a clear channel frequency. So at night, it reduces power to 500 watts to avoid interference with Class A stations KYW Philadelphia and XECPAE Mexico City. It uses a directional antenna with a three-tower array after sunset. The transmitter is on Calle Bella Vista near Interstate 10 in Guadalupe. The station can also be heard on HD Radio receivers at 100.7 FM KSLX-FM-HD2. The station signed on the air on April16, 1960; 63 years ago(1960-04-16). The original call sign was KUPD (pronounced Cupid). It was owned by the Tri-State Broadcasting Co. and by the 1960s featured Phoenix veteran disc jockey Bill Heywood in the morning. KUPD had a full-service Middle of the Road (MOR) format. It competed with KOY 550 AM. As the Top 40 format became more popular, KUPD flipped to a contemporary hits sound in the early 1970s. Around 1971, the station added a simulcast on 97.9 KUPD-FM, which remained Top 40 until about 1978 when the FM station switched to album rock and became a dominant presence in the Phoenix radio market. The flip of KUPD-FM to rock sparked 1060 AM to also change. It became KKKQ ""The New KQ"" under Program Director Steve Casey, formerly with Top 40 leader KHJ Los Angeles and later one of the co-creators of MTV. KKKQ played oldies with a less talk, more music approach. The staff included Joe Bailey - mornings; Don Richards - Middays; Steve Casey - Afternoons. Don Richards would later take over as PD when Steve Casey left for MTV. In the 1980s and early 1990s, AM 1060 cycled through various musical formats such as R&B 'KQ' from 1981 to 1987. The call letters slightly changed to KUKQ after a public outcry about having 'KKK' in the call letters for an R&B station. It then tried country music as ""KQ Country"") from 1987 to 1989. Then it flipped to alternative rock from 1989 to 1993. During this time, KUKQ's original license was not renewed as the result of a 1988 comparative renewal hearing for KUKQ and KUPD-FM. Both stations lost their original licenses for lying to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) about an alleged secret owner. An additional owner was ruled unfit to hold a license due to a 1982 criminal conviction in Arizona. The stations were instead awarded to former owner Jack Grimm, his wife Jackie, Ruth Clifford, and radio executive Robert Fish, doing business as G&C Broadcasting. In 1992, G&C took over KUKQ and KUPD-FM on new licenses, retaining the call letters, facilities and formats of the stations. The new owners switched to a talk radio format in 1993. The station returned to alternative rock again the next year after the station was sold to Sandusky Newspapers. The alternative revival did not last long. For a brief time in 1996, 1060 AM became ""KUPD-2"" (billed by management as ""rock entertainment""). It flipped to sports talk later that year. After the switch to sports, the station started referring to itself as ""The Deuce,"" and the call letters officially shifted to KDUS in 1997. Once its identity as a sports talk station become established, KDUS stopped using ""Deuce"" in its slogans, and adopted ""The Fan AM 1060"" as its identifier (""The Fan"" for short) and ""The Voice of the Fan"" as its slogan. On April 1, 2013, The Fan AM 1060 changed its affiliation from Yahoo! Sports Radio to the new NBC Sports Radio network. Its branding switched to ""NBC Sports Radio AM 1060"". But the NBC Sports Radio network did not get as many affiliates as management had hoped. So in 2019, it announced it would be shutting down most of its 247 programming. On August 30, 2019, KDUS removed all associations with NBC Sports Radio. It rebranded simply ""KDUS AM 1060"" and began an affiliation with SB Nation Radio. In July 2020, the radio network changed its name to SportsMap. KDUS airs four hours worth of local programming on weekdays. It also carries three nationally syndicated sports programs: The Dan Patrick Show from Premiere Networks, The Doug Gottlieb Show from Fox Sports Radio (Phoenix's primary Fox Sports affiliate, 910 KGME, runs local programming instead of Patrick and Gottlieb), and The Rich Eisen Show from Westwood One. Overnights and most weekend programming is provided by SportsMap, a radio network based in Houston. Brokered specialty programs air in random time slots at night and on the weekend. KDUS is the Phoenix radio home of Northern Arizona University football, NAU men's basketball, and Notre Dame football. The station also broadcasts nationally syndicated NCAA and NFL football games and NCAA men's basketball games via the Sports USA Radio Network and Compass Media Networks. KDUS is also the flagship station for Arizona State University baseball and ASU women's basketball. KDUS was the flagship station of the National Hockey League's Phoenix Coyotes on AM from the team's first year in 1996 through the 2007–08 season, after which its rights were acquired by 910 KGME. KDUS carried the National Football League's Arizona Cardinals on AM from 1997 through the 2004 season, after which its rights were acquired by 620 KTAR. KDUS also aired broadcasts from the Arizona Hotshots of the short-lived Alliance of American Football. Since the AM signal of KDUS doesn't completely cover the Phoenix area, particularly at night, both the Cardinals and Coyotes arranged to have their games simulcast on FM sister stations KDKB or KSLX-FM.

"Taganka Theatre (Russian: Театр на Таганке, Театр драмы и комедии на Таганке, ""Таганка"") is a theater located in the Art Nouveau building on Taganka Square in Moscow. The Drama and Comedy Theater was founded in 1946. The head director was Aleksandr Plotnikov and the actors came from various Moscow theater schools and provincial theaters. By 1960s the theater's attendance was at its lowest and in January 1964 Plotnikov resigned. In his place came Yuri Lyubimov, then an actor at Vakhtangov theater who brought with him his own students from Shchukin Theater School. Under Lyubimov, the theatre shot to popularity in Moscow, with Vladimir Vysotsky, Zinaida Slavina and Alla Demidova as the leading actors. Other notable members of Lyubimov's troupe have been Valery Zolotukhin, Veniamin Smekhov, and Leonid Filatov. Nikolai Erdman (famous for his work with Vsevolod Meyerhold in the 1920s) was responsible for the theatre's repertoire. The theatre had been deep in trouble with Soviet authorities, who banned many of Lyubimov's productions, and eventually in 1984 the director was stripped of his Soviet citizenship while working on a stage production in England and thus forced to stay in exile in the West. When another outstanding stage director, Anatoly Efros, was appointed to run the theatre in Lyubimov's stead, he was boycotted and reviled by leading actors in the foulest terms. After Efros's death three years later, a staunch Communist supporter, Nikolay Gubenko, was nominated to lead the troupe. Lyubimov's return to the theatre in 1989 led to the troupe being split, with Gubenko and his party seceding from Lyubimov's company and forming their own ""Community of Taganka Actors"" (Содружество актеров Таганки). In June, 2011 before a performance of Bertolt Brecht's play The Good Person of Szechwan in Czech Republic the actors of the theatre refused to rehearse unless they were paid first. The 93-year-old Lyubimov paid the money and left the theatre. ""I've had enough of this disgrace, these humiliations, this lack of desire to work, this desire just for money"", he said. Two leading actors of the theatre, Dmitry Mezhevich and Alla Smirdan, as well as some administrative assistants, followed Lyubimov. After Lyubimov's resignation the theater was headed first by Valery Zolotukhin (2011-2013), then by Vladimir Fleisher (2013-2015) and since March 2015, by Irina Apeksimova.",Normal

"Detective Inspector Jack Mooney is a fictional character on the British–French crime drama television series Death in Paradise, portrayed by Ardal O'Hanlon. Mooney is portrayed as ""friendly"" and ""unassuming"", and an underestimated ""genius detective"". Ed Power for The Independent described the character of Mooney as a rarity amongst modern portrayals of detectives on television in that his ""personal life is not a distracting mess"". Mooney first appears in Man Overboard – Part One (Series 6, Episode 5), as a liaison officer assigned to DI Humphrey Goodman when a case brings them to England to track a suspect. In the course of the case Mooney is revealed to be a recent widower; his wife died a month ago, but he pretends the death was some time ago to stop people feeling sorry for him. After the case is solved, Goodman decides to stay in England with his new girlfriend, and Mooney accepts the offer to use Goodman's shack on Saint Marie for a holiday. When he assists the team in investigating a couple of murders on the island during his time there, Mooney accepts the offer to stay and becomes the new DI of Saint Marie. A subplot in the next season follows Mooney's daughter Siobhan leaving the island for university in the United Kingdom. Another subplot follows Mooney's romance with Anna (portrayed by Nina Wadia), a newly divorced traveller visiting Saint Marie.

"Seventy is a priesthood office in the Melchizedek priesthood of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Traditionally, a church member holding this priesthood office is a ""traveling minister"" and an ""especial witness"" of Jesus Christ, charged with the mission of preaching the gospel to the entire world under the direction of the Twelve Apostles. The church teaches that the office of seventy was anciently conferred upon the seventy disciples mentioned in the Gospel of Luke 10:1-2. Multiple individuals holding the office of seventy are referred to collectively as seventies. In practical terms, the priesthood office of seventy is one which has varied widely over the course of history. As originally envisioned by church founder, Joseph Smith, in the 1830s, the seventy were to be a body composed of several separate quorums of up to seventy members each, all of which would be led by seven presidents. These presidents, chosen from the first quorum, would appoint and direct the other quorums of seventy. As introduced by Smith, the apostles and the seventy had authority only outside the main body of church members in Zion, and in the outlying stakes. Members in Zion and the stakes were led by the High Council of Zion (under the direction of the First Presidency) and stake high councils. Historically, the First Quorum of the Seventy came into being in 1835 when seven men were set apart as the First Seven Presidents of the Seventy. In 1837, six of the seven presidents were released because it was discovered that they had previously been ordained high priests. Five of these men were ultimately replaced by others. The other two—Levi W. Hancock and Joseph Young—remained members of the First Seven Presidents for the rest of their lives. The quorums of the seventy are directed and supervised hierarchically by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, who are in turn directed by the First Presidency. As a body, the seventy in the church are considered to be equal in priesthood authority with the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. This presumably means that if the apostles were killed or incapacitated, the seventy could take over the function of the apostles. However, in such circumstances, the seventy would be required to act unanimously. Members of the First and the Second Quorums of the Seventy are general authorities of the church with responsibilities covering the church as a whole. Members of additional Quorums of the Seventy (currently numbered Third through Twelfth) are called an area seventy. Members of these quorums are ordained to the priesthood office of seventy, but they are not general authorities of the church. Area seventies generally have authority only within a geographical unit of the church called an area. By the time Joseph Smith was killed, he had already organized four incomplete quorums of seventy. By 1845, there were ten quorums of seventy. The seventies in the first quorum became the seven presidents for each of the other quorums; that is, there were 63 presidents, 7 for each of the 9 other quorums, and the seven remaining members were the presidency of the first quorum. The members of the first quorum were thus spread out across the church, making meetings of the first quorum rare. Elders were often ordained to the office of seventy immediately before they left on a mission. Quorums were not restricted to geography, so individual quorums were scattered all over the world. In 1883, church president John Taylor localized the quorums of seventy. Each stake was given a quorum of seventy, and seventies in that stake would belong to that quorum. Taylor also prescribed that the senior president of the first 64 quorums could meet with the seven presidents of the first quorum and that would constitute a meeting of the first quorum. This never happened, however. This organization continued until church president Spencer W. Kimball's reorganization of the seventies in 1976. Though the number of seventies in the church grew, the number of presidents remained at seven. By the late 1930s, the First Seven Presidents were exclusively referred to by the church as the First Council of the Seventy. Eventually, the stake quorums of seventy were no longer numbered and in 1936 they were put under the local responsibility of stake presidents. Subsequently, in 1961, church president David O. McKay ordained those of the First Council of the Seventy who wished to be high priests. In 1975, under Kimball's direction, the First Quorum of the Seventy was reconstituted. The First Quorum was composed of the former members of the First Council of the Seventy as well as new individuals selected by Kimball. The reason for the change was that the growth of the church necessitated the call of more general authorities. In 1976, the First Council of the Seventy, the First Quorum of the Seventy, and the Assistants to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles were all merged into a new First Quorum of the Seventy under a seven-member Presidency of the Seventy. In 1978, some of the older members of the seventy were ""retired"" as the first general authorities to be given emeritus status. However, members appointed through 1981 were still granted life tenure. In 1986, all stake quorums of the seventy were discontinued. The church encouraged local leaders to have ordained seventies meet with the local elders quorum or to ordain them as high priests. In 1984, some seventies were appointed to the First Quorum of the Seventy who were not to serve for life, but for terms of three to five years. In 1989, these limited-term members were separated into a new Second Quorum of the Seventy. At the same time, the general practice was instituted of releasing all members of the First Quorum at the October general conference following their 70th birthdays, or earlier in the case of serious health problems. Some flexibility on the terms of service has emerged in recent years. Since 1989, members of the First and Second Quorums have continued as general authorities of the church. Sometimes members are called from the Second Quorum into the First Quorum. Since the 1976 merger of First Quorum of the Seventy, seventies are the most usual candidates to become members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Since 1976, three have been called as apostles who did not serve as general authority seventies prior to their call: Russell M. Nelson, Dallin H. Oaks, and David A. Bednar, Nelson and Oaks were ordained apostles in 1984 under church president Kimball and Bednar in 2004 under church president Gordon B. Hinckley. Additionally, having served previously as members of the First Quorum of the Seventy, both Robert D. Hales and Gary E. Stevenson were serving as the Presiding Bishop at the time of their call to the Quorum of the Twelve. At the church's April 1995 general conference, Hinckley announced the creation of a new leadership position known as the area authority. The area authorities were to replace the regional representatives who had served as bridge of leadership between the general authorities and the local stake and mission presidents. In 1997, it was decided that area authorities would be ordained to the office of seventy. As a result, these area authorities were renamed area authority seventies, and the church announced that these new seventies would become members of the newly created Third, Fourth, and Fifth Quorums of the Seventy. Later, the title ""area authority seventy"" was shortened to area seventy, which is the title currently in use. Area seventies serve in the various geographic regions of the world called areas in which the church is governed by area presidencies. Each of the Church's area presidency members usually consist of members of the First and Second Quorums of the Seventy (with the most recent exception, beginning in April 2022, being the presidency of the Europe East Area, which consists of 3 area seventies), . In 2004, the Fifth Quorum of the Seventy was divided to create the Sixth Quorum. In May 2005, the Seventh and Eighth quorums were created. The Fourth Quorum, which had served Mexico, Central and South America, had grown to 72 members, and was split into the Fourth and Seventh Quorums. The Eighth Quorum was created to allow better geographic organization of the Third Quorum (not because the number of members exceeded seventy). The Third Quorum previously covered all of Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and the western islands of the Pacific. The new Eighth Quorum serves Southern Asia, Australia, and the western islands of the Pacific. The Third Quorum continued to serve Africa, northern Asia, and Europe. By August 2019, with new areas having been created or existing areas consolidated with others, the Third Quorum then included area seventies in Africa and Europe, with the Fourth Quorum including those serving in the Caribbean, Central America, Mexico, and South America Northwest areas. The Fifth Quorum had been composed of those area seventies serving in the North America West and Utah areas, with the Sixth Quorum composed of the North America Central, North America Northeast, North America Southeast, and North America Southwest areas. The Seventh Quorum included those serving in the Brazil and South America South areas, while the Eighth Quorum was composed of area seventies serving in the Asia, Asia North, Philippines, and Pacific areas. Subsequently, effective June 1, 2020, four new Quorums of the Seventy were created, and the geographical distribution of the ten quorums of area seventies were constituted in the following manner: As of 2021, the Quorums of the Seventy are organized into twelve quorums with a presidency of seven. The seventy act as emissaries of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and First Presidency of the church in organizing, training, proselytizing, and administering to millions of people scattered all across the globe. The seventy are the layer between local church administration and general church administration. In general, seventies must first be at least elders in the Melchizedek priesthood, but in practice most have previously been ordained to the office of high priest. Seventies, being equal in authority, act under the direction of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles as they labor in their apostolic ministry. Members of the LDS Church understand that being “equal in authority” (D&C 107:26) means they preside over the church when the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve are not constituted. This means that the seventies have the power to do anything required to organize and administer the church, as long as they do so under the direction of the First Presidency or the Quorum of the Twelve (D&C 107:33–34). They do not, as quorums, preside over the church by their own authority unless the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve are no longer in existence. Apart from the seven presidents of the seventy, seventies do not hold priesthood keys but are delegated the necessary keys to perform their duties. Seventies hold apostolic authority in the sense of being “especial witnesses of Christ.” and the Quorums of the Seventy may become the presiding authority over the church if the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve cease to exist. Historically, seven members of the First Quorum of the Seventy were called to serve as the Presidency of the Seventy. This precedent was broken, however, when in 2004 Robert C. Oaks of the Second Quorum of the Seventy was sustained to fill the vacancy created by Dieter F. Uchtdorf's call to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. The church now states that the seven presidents are drawn from General Authority Seventies. Historically, members of the Presidency of the Seventy would often serve as heads of various church ecclesiastical departments. This practice changed in 2004, when area presidencies in the United States and Canada were dissolved; these areas were put directly under the jurisdiction of the Presidency of the Seventy. The management of these areas is currently the primary responsibility of the Presidency of the Seventy. In April 2018, church leaders announced that, effective August 1, 2018, three-man presidencies composed of General Authority Seventies would once again oversee areas in the US and Canada. These areas will continue to be administered from church headquarters. The church indicated this will enable the Presidency of the Seventy to more fully assist the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and to fill other assignments as needed. The Presidency of the Seventy is unique in the church in that not only are there seven members but all seven hold the priesthood ""keys"" of presidency. The man with the longest tenure of uninterrupted service in the presidency is called to preside over the other six as the presiding president or senior president of the seventy. As of December 2023, there is a vacancy in the Presidency of the Seventy, following the call of Patrick Kearon, who had been serving as the senior president, to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles earlier in the month. The list below shows the current presidency and the dates they began in that role: The First Quorum of the Seventy are general authorities, meaning they have authority throughout the church. They usually serve until their 70th birthday or until their health fails them, at which time they are given emeritus status and released from active service as a general authority. Members of the First Quorum of the Seventy serve under the direction of the Quorum of the Twelve and the Presidency of the Seventy. They do not generally visit local units of the church, teach or give sermons in church meetings except when given specific assignment. Often, members of this quorum will accompany the Twelve on their visits to missions and stakes throughout the church. Other times, they will be sent to act in behalf of the Quorum of the Twelve to stake conferences and to provide training and support to stakes, missions, areas, and temples. As general authorities, members of the First Quorum are often asked to speak at church general conferences. Members of the Second Quorum of the Seventy serve in the same role to that of the First Quorum. They are general authorities, which means they have authority throughout the church and are frequently asked to speak in general conference. They are typically called to serve for approximately five to six years. Prior to October 2015, upon their release, these men ceased to be general authorities or members of the Second Quorum of the Seventy. However, although no specific change in policy or practice was announced, at the church's general conference in October 2015, those released from the Second Quorum of the Seventy were designated as emeritus general authorities for the first time. One of these men, Bruce A. Carlson, is not 70 years old, having it appear the practice may continue to be related to length of service for their release and emeritus designation, rather than specifically age. Also in October 2015, some former members of the Second Quorum of Seventy who had been released in prior years, received letters from the church's First Presidency designating them as emeritus general authorities. In all cases, they retain the priesthood office of seventy. In 2015, the church stopped publicly differentiating between members of the First and Second Quorums of the Seventy, using the more generic term ""General Authority Seventies."" In April 2016, eleven men were called to be General Authority Seventies. However, they were not sustained to a specific quorum. By April 2016, biographies of all members of both quorums used only the generic designation. Though all general authority seventies still serve in one of those two quorums (First or Second), such affiliations are now no longer publicized, which constituted an official change in church practice. Although no longer fully functioning general authorities, emeritus general authorities may be asked to be temple presidents or mission presidents. Prior to October 2015, with the exception of Eldred G. Smith (Patriarch to the Church) and three other men (who were formerly in the Presiding Bishopric) all emeritus general authorities in church history had served as members of the First Quorum of the Seventy. Although no specific change in policy or practice was announced, at the church's general conference in October 2015, those released from the Second Quorum of the Seventy were designated as emeritus general authorities for the first time. They remain general authorities until their deaths, but an emeritus general authority is not a member of a seventies quorum. John K. Carmack, the former head of the Perpetual Education Fund and W. Rolfe Kerr, a former Church Commissioner of Education, are both emeritus general authorities. Jacob de Jager served as a bishop after he was given emeritus status. In the general conference meeting in which Ezra Taft Benson was first sustained as president of the church, the emeritus general authorities were sustained. However, when Howard W. Hunter was sustained as president of the church the emeritus general authorities were not mentioned in the list of church officials that were sustained. Members of the Third through Twelfth Quorums of the Seventy are not general authorities, and generally maintain their non-religious vocations. Unlike apostles and members of the First and Second quorums, they do not relocate to Salt Lake City in order to be close to church headquarters. Members of these quorums are area seventies. As assigned, they carry out the duties typically carried out by members of the First and Second quorums of Seventy, which include reorganizing and creating stakes, training stake presidencies, presiding at stake conferences, serving in area presidencies, touring missions, and training mission presidents. They serve in their callings for approximately six to ten years. Upon their release, they cease to be area seventies and members of a quorum of the seventy, but retain the priesthood office of seventy. They live and serve in the respective areas of the church shown below. Members of the First and Second Quorums of Seventy receive the sealing power which authorizes them to seal husbands to wives, and children to their parents, in any of the church's temples. Members of the other Quorums of the Seventy do not receive this as part of their calling.",Normal

"Rabbi Moshe Rosenstain (Hebrew: רבי משה רוזנשטיין 1881–1940) was an Ashkenazi rabbi in pre-World War II Eastern Europe. He served as mashgiach ruchani in the Lomza Yeshiva in Poland. Rabbi Rosenstain was born in Uzvent, Lithuania in 1881. As a teenage student, he studied in the Telshe Yeshiva under Rabbi Shimon Shkop. Rabbi Rosenshtain's mother was the shadchan (matchmaker) between their next door neighbor and R' Yerucham Levovitz, who would later become the mashgiach in the Mir Yeshiva. At age nineteen, Moshe came home from yeshiva for Pesach and met R' Yerucham, with whom he became very close to in the ensuing weeks and months. R' Yerucham was a major baal mussar (literally ""master of ethics,"" here referring to someone who studies ethical works intensely and works tirelessly in self-improvement), a product of the Kelm Talmud Torah, and shared Torah thoughts with Moshe. Three years later, Rabbi Levovitz brought him to learn in the Kelm Talmud Torah. He grew to become a major teacher of mussar. In 1912, Rabbi Rosenstain was appointed mashgiach ruchani of the Lomza Yeshiva in Poland, a position he held for the rest of his life. His saintliness and integrity in the yeshiva was part of what made it unique. In fact, he fasted for thirty years, eating only at night after completing maariv, and on Shabbos and holidays. He walked down the aisle between the shtenders in the yeshiva's beis midrash (study hall) for hours, and the Lomza yeshiva's beis midrash was exceedingly long. He explained, ""It takes me many hours of thinking to come up with one pure thought."" Rabbi Rosenstain slept in the yeshiva's dormitory during the week. He was also very involved in helping his students when the Polish government wanted to draft yeshiva students. His sefarim, Yesodei Hadas and Ahavas Meisharim, contain transcripts of his mussar talks. He died the day before Pesach in 1940, at the age of 59.",Normal
"Antoine François Prévost d'Exiles (UK: ˌpreɪvoʊ dɛɡˈziːl PRAY-voh deg-ZEEL, US: preɪˌvoʊ - pray-VOH -⁠, French: ; 1 April 1697– 25 November 1763), usually known simply as the Abbé Prévost, was a French priest, author, and novelist. He was born at Hesdin, Artois, and first appears with the full name of Prévost d'Exiles, in a letter to the booksellers of Amsterdam in 1731. His father, Lievin Prévost, was a lawyer, and several members of the family had embraced the ecclesiastical estate. His happy childhood ended abruptly, when he lost his mother and his younger favorite sister at the age of 14. Prévost was educated at the Jesuit school of Hesdin, and in 1713 became a novice of the order in Paris, pursuing his studies at the same time at the college in La Flèche. At the end of 1716 he left the Jesuits to join the army, but soon tired of military life, and returned to Paris in 1719, apparently with the idea of resuming his novitiate. He is said to have travelled in the Netherlands about this time; in any case he returned to the army, this time with a commission. Some biographers have assumed that he suffered some of the misfortunes assigned to his hero Des Grieux. Whatever the truth, he joined the learned community of the Benedictines of St Maur, with whom he found refuge, he himself says, after the unlucky termination of a love affair. He took his vows at Jumièges in 1721 after a year's novitiate, and in 1726 took priest's orders at St Germer de Flaix. He spent seven years in various houses of the order, teaching, preaching and studying. In 1728 he was sent to the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, Paris, where he contributed to the Gallia Christiana, a work of historiographic documentation undertaken communally by the monks in continuation of the works of Denys de Sainte-Marthe, who had been a member of their order. His restless spirit made him seek from the Pope a transfer to the easier rule of Cluny; but he left the abbey without leave (1728), and, learning that his superiors had obtained a lettre de cachet against him, fled to England. In London he acquired a wide knowledge of English history and literature, as can be seen in his writings. Before leaving the Benedictines Prévost had begun perhaps his most famous novel, Mémoires et aventures d'un homme de qualité qui s'est retiré du monde, the first four volumes of which were published in Paris in 1728, and two years later at Amsterdam. In 1729 he left England for the Netherlands, where he began to publish (Utrecht, 1731) a novel, the material of which, at least, had been gathered in London, Le Philosophe anglais, ou Histoire de Monsieur Cleveland, fils naturel de Cromwell, écrite par lui-même, et traduite de l'anglais par l'auteur des Mémoires d'un homme de qualité (1731–1739, 8 vols., Amsterdam and Paris). A spurious fifth volume (Utrecht, 1734) contained attacks on the Jesuits; an English translation the same year ends with this volume. Meanwhile, during his residence at the Hague, he engaged on a translation of De Thou's Historia, and, relying on the popularity of his first book, published at Amsterdam a Suite in three volumes, forming volumes v, vi, and vii of the original Mémoires et aventures d'un homme de qualité. The seventh volume contained the famous Manon Lescaut, separately published in Paris in 1731 as Histoire du Chevalier des Grieux et de Manon Lescaut. The book was eagerly read, chiefly in pirated copies, being forbidden in France. In 1733 he left the Hague for London in company of a lady whose character, according to Prévost's enemies, was doubtful. In London he edited a weekly gazette on the model of Joseph Addison's Spectator, Le Pour et contre, which he continued to produce in collaboration with the playwright Charles-Hugues Le Febvre de Saint-Marc, with short intervals, until 1740. In the autumn of 1734 Prévost was reconciled with the Benedictines, and, returning to France, was received in the Benedictine monastery of La Croix-Saint-Leufroy in the diocese of Évreux to pass through a new, though brief, novitiate. In 1735 he was dispensed from residence in a monastery by becoming almoner to the Prince de Conti, and in 1754 obtained the priory of St Georges de Gesnes. He continued to produce novels and translations from the English, and, with the exception of a brief exile (1741–1742) spent in Brussels and Frankfurt, he resided for the most part at Chantilly until his death, which took place suddenly while he was walking in the neighbouring woods. The cause of his death, the rupture of an aneurysm, is all that is definitely known. Stories of crime and disaster were related of Prévost by his enemies, and diligently repeated, but appear to be apocryphal. Prévost's other works include: In Hubert Monteilhet's novel Murder at the Frankfurt Book Fair, the protagonist plagiarizes Histoire d'une Grecque moderne as a practical joke on his obnoxious publisher.",Normal

"Widow conservation was a practice in Protestant Europe in the early modern age, when the widow of a parish vicar (or sometimes her daughter) would marry her husband's successor to the vicarage to ensure her economic support. The practice was common in Scandinavia (ÄnkekonserveringEnkekonservering) and Protestant parts of Germany (Konservierung von Pfarrwitwen). It is related to other forms of widow inheritance, including the levirate marriage known in the Old Testament as yibbum. At the introduction of the Protestant Reformation, priests were allowed to marry. However, as they did not own the vicarage and property attached to their profession, their wife and children were left without a home and means of support after their death. The future support of the widows and children of vicars thereby became a concern for the various churches. The most common solution was for the successor of a vicar to be required to marry the widow (or perhaps her daughter) of his predecessor, thereby ""conserving"" her. In the United Kingdoms of Denmark and Norway, the Kirkeordinansen or Church charter of 1537, issued by Christian III of Denmark after the Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein, secured for the widows of priests the right to a naadensaar (year of grace), during which they were secured an income from the parish of their late husbands and residence at the vicarage. Other than that, however, nothing was done to provide for priests' widows, and when the year was over, they were left to support themselves as well as they could, often as midwives or by some small business enterprise in the closest town. In 1566, a recommendation was issued in which priests were lectured to show mercy to the widows of their predecessors and let them stay in the vicarage, and some vicarages established a widow's house adjoining their vicarage. This proved to be insufficient, and by the early 17th century, it had become customary for a parish to elect a vicar on condition that he marry the widow of his predecessor. There was never any formal law to require this, and if the parish protested to the authorities against a vicar who broke his promise after having been elected, their complaints were given no support by the crown. However, in practice, this was an accepted custom which vicars adjusted to, and during the 17th century it was not uncommon for a woman to have been married to four priests in succession. In 1659, the first local pension fund for vicars' widows was established. This gradually became a more popular option, but some parishes continued to practise widow conservation until the late 18th century. In Mark Brandenburg, widow conservation was a common practice in the 17th century. In 1698, Frederick III of Brandenburg banned widow conservation by the Juramentum simoniae, as being a form of purchase of the vicarage office. Widow conservation was a common practice in East Prussia. The practice was the center of the legend of Ännchen von Tharau, which was inspired by the case of Anna Neander (1615–1689). The first widow conservation in Mecklenburg is documented from 1551, and by 1580 it had become a common practice, which was recommended by the church order of 1602. By 1704, one third of all vicars' wives were the widow of the vicar's predecessor. From 1623 onward, however, there was also an increasing number of widow funds, which made widow conservation less necessary. The last widow conservation took place in the mid-19th century. In Pomerania, the church synod of 1545 saw no other choice but to tolerate the practice, and in 1572, the conservation of the widow or daughter of a vicar was officially declared the duty of his successor. An attempt to replace it with a dowry provided by the congregations in 1575 failed. During the 18th century, the practice started to decline because of more alternatives, such as the foundation of a fund for vicars' widows in Swedish Pomerania in 1775. In the Duchy of Saxony, a strong policy to prevent widow conservation was enforced already when it occurred in the 16th century, and attempts of having a successor of a vicar marry the widow or daughter of his predecessor were actually prevented and contested when it did occur. In Sweden and Finland (then a Swedish province), the parish vicars were given permission to marry after the Swedish Reformation of 1527. The support of vicars' widows quickly became a concern: while priests and their families were being provided for by the income from their parish, this income was attached to their office, and the widow had no right to it after the death of the priest, which could place her in a difficult situation unless she, or her late spouse, had a personal fortune, which was normally not the case. After the death of a vicar, his widow was entitled to a Nådeår or Nådår (Year of Grace) to live on the vicarage while preparing support for herself and her children. During that year, the parish were to select the next vicar. As the parish and church considered it their duty to support the widow of their former vicar, they normally chose a priest who expressed himself willing to marry the widow of his predecessor. The vicar's widow herself also seems to have played a part in electing the next vicar by using the influence she had in the parish by her position as vicar's wife. Another way to arrange the support of the widow was for the next vicar to marry her adult daughter, if she had one, or that the son of a vicar succeeded him. In the Swedish Church Ordinance 1571, the rules stated that the son or the son-in-law of the former vicar were to be considered first when a new parish vicar was chosen. During the 17th century, widow conservation was common practice and the majority of the vicar's wives were the widow or daughter of her husband's predecessor. The Swedish Church Law 1686 stated that when a new parish vicar was to be elected, the candidates who expressed themselves willing to marry the widow or daughter of his predecessor should be favored. This regulation was dropped in 1739, when the education of the vicars became the formal qualification to the office, but informally, the practice continued the entire 18th century, as the parishes continued to regard it their responsibility to support the vicars' wives, who were often locals and had strong positions in their parishes. There were also parishes which were formally inherited this way. In 1591, King John III of Sweden granted the Annerstad parish in Småland to vicar Georgius Marci, to be inherited on both the male and female line by his descendants: either by a son, or by a successor married to a daughter or a widow of his predecessor. Upon the death of Marci in 1613, his parish was inherited by his son-in-law by marriage to his daughter, Kerstin Marca (1585–1653), who has been referred to as the first Swedish female to have formally inherited the right to a vicar's parish. The Annerstad parish was on several occasions inherited by females in the same fashion - such as for example by Gunilla Osængius in 1685 - until the year of 1780, when king Gustav III of Sweden refused the request of a vicars candidate to marry the 12-year-old daughter of the recently deceased vicar Anders Osængius. By the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century, however, widow conservation quickly came out of use. The reasons were several: a different view upon marriage as more of a love union than a practical arrangement; that the education of the candidates, who were less often the sons of vicars, had become more important; and because the recently established retirement funds for vicar's widows made the solution less needed. The first retirement fund was Allmänna Änke- och Pupillkassan i Sverige from 1740, granting pensions to destitute widows of civil servants; this was not sufficient, and during the 19th-century, the Nådår was often prolonged upon application, until the more efficient retirement fund Prästerskapets Änke- och Pupillkassa exclusively for vicar's widows was established in 1874.",Normal

"Colloquial or spoken Finnish (suomen puhekieli) is the unstandardized spoken variety of the Finnish language, in contrast with the standardized form of the language (yleiskieli). It is used primarily in personal communication and varies somewhat between the different dialects. This article focuses on the variety of spoken Finnish that is predominant in the Greater Helsinki region and urbanized areas in the Tavastian and Central Finland dialectal areas, such as the cities of Tampere, Jyväskylä, Lahti, Hyvinkää, and Hämeenlinna – as well as in coastal cities such as Vaasa and Porvoo, which have been traditionally Swedish-speaking and have experienced an influx of Finnish speakers from a variety of dialectal areas. The standard language takes most of its features from these dialects, i.e. most ""dialectal"" features are reductions with respect to this form of language. The combination of the common spoken Finnish and a dialect gives a regional variant (aluepuhekieli), which has some local idiosyncrasies but is essentially similar to the common spoken Finnish. The basics of Finnish needed to fully understand this article can be found in pages about Finnish phonology and Finnish grammar. As in any language, the spoken version(s) of Finnish often vary from the written form. Some of the latter's constructs are either too arbitrary (e.g. ""soft d"", cf. Finnish phonology), or too dialectal, e.g. hän (see below), for use in the spoken language. Furthermore, some very common and ""accentless"" sound changes are not reflected in the standard language, particularly fusion, liaison and some diphthong reductions. There is also the problem that purists want to avoid irregularity regardless of actual usage. This has left some sound changes common in spoken language out from the standard language. There is a tendency to favor ""more logical"" constructs over easily pronounceable ones. This ideal does reflect spoken Finnish usage to a degree, as Finnish is demonstrably a conservative language with few reduction processes, but it is not entirely accurate. The problem of avoiding ""irregularity"" is most evident in spelling, where internal sandhi is not transcribed, because there is the idea that morphemes should be immutable. For example, the ""correct"" spelling is syönpä (""I eat"" with emphasis), even though the pronunciation is usually syömpä. The explanation is that -n- and -pä are in different morphemes just like the explanation that English boys is not spelled with a z is that they are in different morphemes. There are also a number of grammatical forms which are used in written Finnish, but only very rarely in spoken. For example, there are a number of constructions using participles which are usually rendered analytically in speech. Some cases and moods are rarely constructive in spoken Finnish, e.g. the instructive and comitative cases and the potential mood. Some survive only in expressions. On the other hand, spoken language has its own features rarely or never found in formal language. Most importantly, there is very common external sandhi, and some assimilatory sound changes. (On the contrary, there is no vowel reduction.) In some variants (e.g. Vaasa, Kymenlaakso) of spoken Finnish -n kanssa (""with "") is abbreviated into a clitic that is effectively a comitative case, e.g. -nkans or -nkaa. The most common reflexes for old Finnish dental fricatives are d for ð, and ts or t(ː) for θ(ː). For example, metsä, metsän or mettä, metän ← meθθä, meθän ""forest, of the forest"" and meidän < meiðän ""ours"". Loss of d also occurs, e.g. meiän. These are seen as ""accent-free"" pronunciations. Dialects generally have different reflexes — in fact, the different reflexes are used as a distinguishing feature between different dialects. For more details, see Finnish phonology. One important sound change, which has gone to completion in Estonian but occurs idiosyncratically in Finnish, is mutation of word-final n into a glottal stop ʔ, orthographically represented by an apostrophe. In some dialects, such as Savo, word-final n is systematically replaced by ʔ, e.g. isä'iän ← isän ääni ""father's voice"". Both pronunciations can be heard in the Helsinki area. This means that the genitiveaccusative form -n, which is very common in any form of Finnish, is simply noted by a glottal stop. However, this glottal stop undergoes sandhi whenever followed by consonant, or more often than not (see below). Certain wordforms that end in si in Standard Finnish occur without the word-final i in the spoken language. This includes the base form of certain word stems as well as inflectional endings. In nouns this affects the translative case ending -ksi and the 2nd person singular possessive suffix -si. In verbs, loss of i affects the conditional mood ending -isi and, in certain verb inflection classes where it is preceded by an s, the preterite ending -i. These endings occur word-finally in 3rd person forms. In many dialects loss of final i is commonplace not only in these cases but also elsewhere. Particularly in Helsinki, deletion of æ or ɑ, spelt «ä» and «a», respectively, in highly frequent words is common. This is a feature of Western Finnish dialects, found also in Savonian dialects and Estonian. Word-final vowel clusters ending in ɑ or æ have much variation in dialects of Finnish. Especially in Helsinki they assimilate, where only the resulting chroneme marks the partitive in many words. An eɑ or eæ cluster also appears in many adjectives: In other areas of Finland, these clusters may have a different fate. Another common dialectal variant is the raising of e to i in the adjectives: pimiä. (Partitives are unaffected by this.) Some rarer versions of this suffix include -jä -ja, -ie, and even -ii. Similar to the diphthongization of older *eː oː øː to ie̯ uo̯ yø̯ (unchanged in standard Estonian), many eastern dialects of Finnish diphthongize also the long vowels ɑː æː to oɑ̯ eæ̯. In Savonian dialects, these have shifted further on to uɑ̯ iæ̯. ie̯ uo̯ yø̯ can become iː uː yː when in contact with another vowel. In many cases this results from colloquial deletion of d. For example: A related phenomenon is the final consonant sandhi. When two words co-occur in the same prosodic unit, the consonant beginning the second word assimilates to the word-final consonant in the first word, creating a long consonant. This is not commonly written down, except in dialectal transcriptions. For example, Some dialects have the full-length personal pronouns minä and sinä, but most people use shorter forms, like these found in Greater Helsinki region: Note: these do differ depending on where the speaker is from. For example minä can also be mie, miä, mää etc. The root words are also shorter: The third-person pronouns hän ('he', 'she', singular 'they') and he (plural 'they'), are rarely used in the spoken language outside of Southwestern Finland and are getting rare there, as well. Elsewhere, they are usually replaced by se and ne, which in the standard language do not refer to people. For example, the sentence ""Did he mistake me for you?"" has these forms: Similarly, non-personal demonstrative pronouns are often used in place of hän or he, meaning people may be referred to as 'that' and 'those'. This also does not carry any pejorative meaning. The words are also changed from their written form. For example, when pointing out a culprit, the sentence ""He broke it."" has these forms: Numerals 1-10 in colloquial spoken Finnish: Numbers 11-19 are formed by appending -toista, which can be shortened to -toist. Numbers 20-90 are formed by appending -kymmentä, which can be shortened to -kymment or even -kyt(ä). Kolme, neljä and seittemän can be abbreviated to kol-, nel- and seit- with -kytä, but not independently, as in kolkytäkolme ""33"" or seitkytäneljä ""74"". When counting out loud, even shorter forms are used, mostly one-syllable words with long vowels: -toista becomes -toi, -too or even -to. -kymmentä becomes -kyt, with 20-60 typically retaining their longer numeral forms (e.g. kakskyt rather than *kaakyt for 20). 70 is typically seitkyt or seiskyt, while 80 and 90 do with kasi- and ysi-. The numerals 1–9 have their own names, different from the cardinal numbers used in counting. Numbers that have longer names are often shortened in speech. This may be problematic for a foreigner to understand, if they have learnt words by book: The -kko suffix normally denotes a group of x people, but on 8 and 9, it doubles as a synonym for the numeral's name. Kahdeksikko is also used to describe a figure eight shape. The regular -Onen -inen forms can additionally be used of objects with an ID number. For example, bus 107 is called sataseiska, and a competition winner is an ykkönen (not *sataseittemän or *yks.) Personal pronouns are used extensively in spoken Finnish whereas in formal forms the pronoun is often optional (indicated in brackets in this article). Furthermore, the pronouns themselves in spoken Finnish are different from those used in formal Finnish. Personal pronouns mä and sä are used extensively in colloquial Finnish in place of minä and sinä ('I' and singular 'you'). The pronouns se and ne, which in the formal language are used only as non-human personal pronouns meaning ('it' and plural 'they'), are used in the spoken language as personal pronouns (which in the formal language would be hän ('he', 'she' and singular 'they') and he (plural 'they'). See the tables below for examples. One striking difference between colloquial Finnish and formal Finnish is use of the passive form in the first person plural. Thus for example: Another is that the third person plural suffix -vat or -vät is not used in the spoken language; instead, the third person singular form is used with plural meaning being conveyed by the pronoun ne (they) Therefore, the full present-tense paradigm of puhua ""to speak"" in everyday speech is: Some e-stem verbs have abbreviated (irregular) oblique forms, where n or l is elided. This class includes only four frequently used verbs. In Finnish, verbs have an infinitive form, marked with -ta and used in the infinitive, and an oblique form, which is used in personal forms. Consonant gradation and assimilation of the 't' in -ta may be applied. In the standard language, the correspondence between the two is always regular. In spoken language, some verbs have assimilated oblique forms, while retaining the regular infinitive: For example, these forms, as such, are represented by the imperatives: To demonstrate the use of the personal form, the reply is: The infinitives are unchanged, as in: As are participles, despite their using the oblique stem: The 't' at the end of participles ending -nut, -rut, -lut, -sut (or -nyt etc.) is often dropped when no consonant follows, or replaced by gemination of the following consonant: but: is actually pronounced as if it were: In the formal language some pronouns are considered optional, but in spoken language the pronoun is usually enunciated but may be optional when answering questions (which puts the person in the proper context). In the latter example, dropping me would change the meaning from a statement to a suggestion: Compare the conjugation of OLLA in the formal language (Table 1) and in the spoken or colloquial language (Table 2). Table 2 shows in highlights the areas where there are differences in the structures between formal and informal. Optional pronouns are in brackets. English equivalent is in Table 3. In everyday speech, the -kokö suffix has the -s clitic added, becoming -koskös, which in turn reduces to -ks: The choice of morphemes -koskös or -ks is not always purely dialectal or accidental. Many Finns regularly use more than one variation in their speech. The choice might depend among others on the rhythm of the sentence or the (wished) tempo of the discussion. Sometimes it has other clearly communicational purposes e.g. the longer variation might be used to soften an intruding question. The clitic -s is also found in imperatives, e.g. me(n)es ""(I expect you to) go!"" It can also be, that the -tkö elides not to -ks, but -t before a 's', e.g. menetkö sä? me(n)et sä. Because this is identical to sä menet except for the word order, questions are indicated by word order. Spoken language has a different grammar for the possessive suffix. In contrast, in the literary language, the pronoun is optional and typically omitted. Compare English in which, e.g., ""The house to which this door belongs"" would be the correct written form even though ""the house whose door this is"" would be the more common spoken version. Here, the pronoun of the literary form is also shown. Notice that Finnish has no possessive adjectives. The pronouns are regularly inflected, like if ""I's house"", ""you's house"", ""we's house"". However, the suffixes -s, -nsa and -nne are used to avoid repeating a pronoun, e.g. ""He took his hat and left"" is Se otti lakkinsa ja lähti. (The translation from English *Se otti sen lakin ja lähti would mean ""He took hisher hat and left"" or ""He took the (specific) hat and left""). When a negative sentence is formed, the main verb goes into the imperative mood and gives all of its inflections to the negative verb ei, e.g. tuemme → emme tue. Usually the word mitään (""anything"") and an expletive is added to the sentence. This means that even if the negative verb ei is left out, the meaning is indicated by this context. For example: This omission of the negative verb ei is considered one of the most recent changes in Finnish. Usually this construction indicates mistrust or frustration. (A parody article by Jaakko Häkkinen calls this aggressiivi, see aggressive mood.) However, it can be a neutral negative statement: Tästä artikkelista mitään opi (From this article, you don't learn anything). Linguists such as Mielikäinen argue that the dialects of Finnish have been considerably homogenized by 20th century developments of urbanization and other internal population movements to the point that ""pure"" dialects have disappeared. ""Local spoken languages"" have developed from standard Finnish to give variety with essentially standard Finnish structure but with some local features. Considerable stigma has been associated with dialects (accurately or not) perceived as rural in the 20th century. People who have moved to the city have adopted a variety resembling standard Finnish, which has been imposed upon dialect speakers by the school, the military and the employers. Breaking up some consonant clusters on syllable boundaries with an epenthetic vowel is a feature of several dialects, such as those of Ostrobothnia and Savonia: The neutral vowel is the same as the preceding vowel. For example, juhla → juhula ""celebration"", salmi → salami ""strait"", palvelu → palavelu ""service"", halpa → halapa ""cheap"", äffä → ähävä (via ähvä) ""letter F"". Pairs of dissimilar consonants with l or h (in Savo, also n) as the first consonant are subject to epenthesis; other clusters or geminates are not. However, a strong epenthetic vowel is seen as dialectal, and in Helsinki and urbanized areas, indicates origins ""in the countryside"" (since for Helsinki people, everything but Helsinki is rural). Tavastian dialects are diverse because other, surrounding dialects have influenced them. The following features are all found in Finnish spoken in Helsinki, and many of them occur also in some other Tavastian dialects.",Normal

"""Island in the Sun"" is a song written by Harry Belafonte and Irving Burgie (Lord Burgess), and performed by Harry Belafonte for the 1957 film Island in the Sun and on his 1957 album Belafonte Sings of the Caribbean. The song was one of two songs (the other song being ""Lead Man Holler"") written by Harry Belafonte and Irving Burgie for the 1957 film Island in the Sun, a film on racial tension and interracial romance. The song serves as the title song sung at the start of the film, which ends with Belafonte walking off to the humming of the song. Belafonte performed the song on The Ed Sullivan Show in June 9, 1957 to promote the film. It was also released as a single backed with ""Cocoanut Woman"" in May 1957; both songs charted, and ""Island in the Sun"" reached No. 30 on the Billboard's Best Sellers in Stores, and No. 42 on Top 100 Sides. In 2017, Belafonte released the album When Colors Come Together: The Legacy of Harry Belafonte for his 90th birthday with the intention of fostering racial harmony, which included a new version of ""Island in the Sun"" titled ""When Colors Come Together (Our Island in the Sun)"" performed by a multi-ethnic children choir. In 1999, the song was adapted into a children's picture book, illustrated with cut-paper collages by Alex Ayliffe and published by Dial Books. The book was an Américas Award commended title and received generally positive reviews. The song has also been covered by many artists, including The Merrymen, José Carreras, The Paragons, and The Righteous Brothers. In 1962, the song was performed by The Brothers Four on the album In PersonCross-Country Concert. The song has been sung in other languages; as early as 1958, Henri Salvador wrote lyrics and sang the song in French. Caterina Valente performed the song in German as ""Wo meine Sonne scheint "". Bo-Göran Edling wrote lyrics in Swedish, and as De tusen öars land, the song was recorded by the Streaplers, releasing it as a single in October 1969 with En enda kort minut acting as a B-side. and their version also charted at Svensktoppen for 19 weeks between 28 December 1969-4 May 1970, and managed to top the chart. With these lyrics the song was also recorded in 1970 by Nora Brockstedt, by Tage Öst in 1976, and Källströms in 1985 and finally in 2005 by Hans Martin. With lyrics in Swedish by Margot Borgström, as Sol, öar, vind och hav, the song was also recorded by Schytts on the 1979 album Nya änglalåtar and their version charted for 10 weeks at Svensktoppen between 13 April-24 August 1980, and also managed to top the chart. The Croatian version sung by Darko Rundek was recorded in 2000 for album U širokom svijetu (rereleased in 2017 on compilation ApoCalypso)",Normal
"Paectes obrotunda is a moth of the family Euteliidae first described by Achille Guenée in 1852. It is found in Brazil. The species is only known from the female holotype. Formerly, the species was recorded from Southern North America (including Florida) through Central America to South America. It is also found on the Greater Antilles and Lesser Antilles. These records were based on misidentifications. The forewing length is 9.2mm for females. There are a few white scales forming short dashes along the costa, especially from the postmedial band to just below the apex. There is a thin black antemedial line running from the posterior margin, forming ventral border to the faint basal spot. The medial area of the wing has some scattered white scales forming an indistinct area proximal to the postmedial line. This postmedial line is black and faint at the posterior margin, becoming more distinct prior to a subapical, marginal black dash. The apical spot is white and the terminal line consists of a series of black, recurved lines between the veins. The hindwings have a dark gray marginal band that extends to the middle of the wing with the veins highlighted in dark gray. This Euteliinae article is a stub.

"Guillermo Vicente Misa III, nicknamed ""G3"" is a Filipino singersongwriter and recording artist based in Los Angeles. He is also the former lead guitarist of the band Introvoys. He is known for the song ""Habangbuhay"", his carrier single from his 2014 solo album ""Never Look Back"". The music video for ""Habangbuhay"" features singeractress Geneva Cruz as his leading lady. G3 comes from a family of musicians. Jim Paredes of APO Hiking Society is his uncle. G3 started playing acoustic guitar at the age of 13 when his dad, GV Misa (singeractorcommercial model) taught him some 3 chord Beatles and Beach Boys songs. At age 15, he played the electric guitar and formed his first band 'Trial and Error' along with his classmates from De La Salle Santiago Zobel School. He continued on to play in various bands during his college days. G3 was a member of the bands Violent Playground, Spinning Jenny, Mystery and Shanghaied. He would occasionally play guitar for the band Rivermaya whenever Rico Blanco would get sick. In 1991, G3 along with Vanessa Garcia of the band Prettier Than Pink put up a studio called ""Session Band Rehearsal & Recording Studio"" located at the basement parking of Makati Cinema Square. It was where bands like Rivermaya formed. Razorback and Wolfgang also rehearsed and recorded demo material at Session Studio. In 1993, G3 was invited to be the guitarist of Violent Playground. The line up was RJ Oca on vocals, Raton del Gallego on guitar, Boom Jose on drums and Mali Andres on bass. They played regularly at ""Weekends Live"" at the Atrium of Makati. In 1994, G3 joined the alternative rock band ""Shanghaied"", which recorded a cover of the hit song, ""Batugan"", by Labuyo from the compilation album ""Mga Himig Natin – Pinoy Rock Revisited"" under Vicor Records.

They also released their own version of ""Little Drummer Boy"" as part of a Christmas compilation album called ""Christmas on the Rocks"" under Viva Records. In 1997, G3 got a call from his former classmate, Paco Arespacochaga to join his band Mystery. He went to Pink Noise recording studio thinking he would audition for guitars but he was asked to sing instead. His vocal audition made it straight into Mystery's album ""Jigsaw"" released under Star Records. They also released a music video for their single ""Someday me and you"" produced by Star Cinema. G3 also appeared as a guest along with his bandmates in the TV show Gimik. G3 had a passion for computer programming. He would always bring a programming book to a gig and read it during breaks. In 1995, he developed a Billing and Collection system as well as a Payroll system for his own business, Session Band Rehearsal and Recording Studio. In 2000, G3 left Mystery to pursue a software engineering career. He started as a software developer in Fujitsu Philippines where he learned Java, C# and SQL. In 2002, he became the Application Development Manager for Jollibee Foods Corporation, one of the biggest companies in the Philippines. In 2007, he migrated to Los Angeles to become a Lead Software Developer for Myspace. In 2012, he worked for Fandango, a subsidiary of NBCUniversal as a Software Architect. In 2015, he joined ADP as a Principal Applications Developer. Currently, G3 is a Senior Software Engineer at Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. In 2017, he married Sharmila Benedicto, a dentist. In Los Angeles, G3 got a call again from Paco Arespacochaga, asking if he could be the guitarist for Introvoys which was also now based in Los Angeles.

"St. John's Vancouver Anglican Church (known in short as ""St. John's Vancouver"") is an evangelical Anglican church in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was founded in 2011 by the clergy and almost all of the laity of St. John's Shaughnessy after the group left the Anglican Church of Canada over theological and moral issues and the congregation lost a legal battle to keep its building during the Anglican realignment. With more than 700 in regular attendance, it is the largest church in the Anglican Network in Canada, a diocese of the Anglican Church in North America. Until 2011, St. John's Vancouver shares its history with St. John's Shaughnessy, which was founded in 1925 and whose building was dedicated in 1950. By the 1970s, St. John's had become known for high-church Anglo-Catholic liturgies. The church's membership had significantly declined and the church's finances were deteriorating. The vestry called the Rev. Harry Robinson, a prominent low-church evangelical within the Anglican Church of Canada, as rector in 1978. During his theological studies in England, he had befriended notable evangelicals like John R. W. Stott, J. I. Packer, and Dick Lucas and he had experience developing a strong student ministry. A year after Robinson's arrival, Packer took an appointment at Regent College. Considered one of the preeminent evangelical theologians, Packer also received an appointment as honorary assistant priest at St. John's, which he held until his death in 2020. Robinson presided over significant growth and renewal at St. John's. Future Saskatchewan Bishop Tony Burton said that Robinson took over ""a moribund, complacent small congregation, and at considerable personal cost set it on the path to becoming Canada's largest Anglican community, and one of its liveliest and most creative."" By the time Robinson retired in 1992, St. John's had grown to an average weekly attendance of 800 and was widely reported to be the largest Anglican church in Canada. Robinson was succeeded by the Rev. David Short, a priest from the Anglican Diocese of Sydney and the son of Bishop Ken Short, who continued Robinson's low-church evangelical practices and teaching. In 1998, Short launched Artizo, a training program for priests that has graduated over 100 clergy. The church also developed educational resources used by more than 90 other churches. In 2007, St. John's planted a church in Richmond. In 2002, the Diocese of New Westminster synod controversially approved the blessing of same-sex unions. Packer, Short, and other delegates from St. John's, along with delegates from seven other churches, walked out of the synod in objection. The dissenting churches formed a group called the Anglican Communion in New Westminster (ACiNW) and declared impaired communion with Bishop Michael Ingham. Short and the other clergy walking out faced canonical charges from Ingham. The synod decision became a major flashpoint in the Anglican realignment. After the failure of the ACiNW churches to obtain alternative episcopal oversight from within the Anglican Church of Canada, in February 2008 St. John's membership voted with 96 percent in favor to disaffiliate from the Anglican Church of Canada and become canonically resident in the Anglican Church of the Southern Cone. The Southern Cone agreed to provide primatial oversight for traditionalist Anglican churches in Canada as an interim step to creating an eventual parallel province in North America. In April 2008, Short, Packer and St. John's vicar Dan Gifford formally relinquished their ministry in the Anglican Church of Canada and join the Anglican Network in Canada. The church was involved in litigation over the ownership of its $13 million property; the Supreme Court of British Columbia (a trial court jurisdiction) in 2009 affirmed that the property belonged to the Diocese of New Westminster. The higher B.C. Court of Appeal affirmed the ruling, and the Supreme Court of Canada declined to hear the case,resulting in all of the clergy and the bulk of the congregation leaving the 1950 building on September 18, 2011. The departing clergy members relaunched the church as St. John's Vancouver with about 700 members in rented facilities at Oakridge Seventh-Day Adventist Church. Since 2011, St. John's Vancouver has held steady at around 700 in weekly attendance. In 2022, Gifford was consecrated as the new diocesan bishop of ANiC, and St. John's Vancouver began planning for a $12–25 million capital project to buy or build a permanent church building. Since 1998, nearly 100 clergy have been trained through St. John's Artizo Institute, which provides a two-year apprenticeship for junior clergy to complement seminary education. Artizo graduates may move on to a residency, similar to a curacy, at another church. Artizo graduates serve ANiC churches across Canada, as well as churches throughout the Anglican Church in North America. They also serve in Lutheran, Reformed, C&MA, and non-denominational contexts across the English-speaking world. Many Artizo graduates have served as church planters, and St. John's has during its history planted several churches, including St. Peter's Fireside in downtown Vancouver, St. John's Richmond, and a new church plant in the area encompassing East Vancouver, Burnaby, and New Westminster. St. John's Vancouver partners with Helping Point in India, Ratanak International in Cambodia, and the Anglican Diocese of the Upper Shire in Malawi.",Normal
"Michael Edward Lowry (March 8, 1939 – May 1, 2017) was an American politician who served as the 20th governor of Washington from 1993 to 1997. His political career ended abruptly following a sexual misconduct allegation made against him by his deputy press secretary, Susanne Albright. A member of the Democratic Party, Lowry served as a United States Representative from Washington's 7th congressional district from 1979 to 1989. Lowry was born and raised in St. John, Washington, son of Helen (nee White) and Robert Lowry. He graduated from Washington State University in 1962. Lowry had a brief career working for the Washington State Senate and as a lobbyist for Group Health Cooperative, before being elected to the King County Council in 1975. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Washington's Seventh Congressional District in 1978, where he served until 1989. Lowry twice ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate. In a 1983 special election, he was defeated by Republican former Governor Dan Evans, then an appointed Senator and the incumbent, in a race to replace Democrat Henry ""Scoop"" Jackson. In 1988, he lost to Slade Gorton, also a Republican, in a close race. Lowry then began working at Seattle University and at an environmental group. Lowry was elected governor in 1992 and served for a single term (to date, he is the last governor of Washington state to serve only one term). His principal policy initiative was a statewide system of health insurance with premiums based on ability to pay. He chose not to run for reelection due to a sexual harassment scandal in which his deputy press secretary, Susanne Albright, accused him of making inappropriate remarks and fondling her. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Commissioner of Public Lands in 2000, and was later active in building affordable housing for Washington's migrant farm workers. Lowry married Mary Carlson in 1968, and they had a daughter. He died from complications of a stroke on May 1, 2017, at the age of 78. During Lowry's career, he was often compared to Yasser Arafat by both media and political opponents in the state of Washington, due to a perceived similarity in physical appearance between the two. According to some reports, Lowry shaved off a beard he formerly sported specifically to avoid comparisons.",Normal
"Flag signals can mean any of various methods of using flags or pennants to send signals. Flags may have individual significance as signals, or two or more flags may be manipulated so that their relative positions convey symbols. Flag signals allowed communication at a distance before the invention of radio and are still used especially in connection with ships. Flaghoist signalling is one or more flags (or pennants) simultaneously flying from a fixed halyard, and generally any method of signaling by such means. Each of the flags has a distinct shape and color combination. Each flag or combination of flags has a preassigned meaning or ""code"". The International Code of Signals defines a standard set of flags and associated alphabet suitable for international use, as well as a set of standard codes. Flaghoist is also used in boat racing, to warn of impending severe weather, and other specialized applications. Maritime flag signalling has a long history, especially prior to the advent of radio, and remains the preferred means of signaling in many situations. In naval flag signalling, additional flags and an expanded list of signals are used for identification and commands, as well as the mercantile uses. Many navies have their own proprietary or secret codes, and use additional flags. A designator flag is used to indicate if a flaghoist signal is meant to be interpreted as an ICS signal or as a naval signal. The U.S. Navy uses a set of 68 flags, including flags for each letter of the alphabet and each numeral to convey messages of tactical or administrative nature. Flag semaphore signalling uses two flags, held in specific positions to signify letters. This method requires simple equipment but can be obscured by bad weather. A permanently installed chain of semaphore stations is a semaphore line and before the invention of the electric telegraph, was the fastest means of communication over moderately long distances.  In the 1850s, U.S. Army Major Albert J. Myer, a surgeon by training, developed a system using left or right movements of a flag (or torch or lantern at night). Myer's system used a single flag, waved back and forth in a binary code conceptually similar to the Morse code of dots and dashes. This is sometimes called the wig-wag method of signaling, or ""wig-wagging"". More mobile than previous means of optical telegraphy, as it only required one flag, this code was used extensively by Signal Corps troops on both sides in the American Civil War. (Its first use in battle was by Confederate Lieutenant Edward Porter Alexander at the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861. In this code, alphabet letters were equated with three positions of a single flag, disk, or light. The flags measured two, four, or six feet (60, 120 or 180cm) square and were generally either red or black banners with white square centers or white banners with red square centers. The disks were 12 to 18inches (30 to 46cm) in diameter and were made of metal or wood frames with canvas surfaces. Somewhat easier to handle than the flags, they provided a different method for daylight communications. The lights were kerosene lanterns attached to a staff. A second ""foot torch"" was placed on the ground before the signalman as a fixed point of reference, making it easier for the recipient to follow the lantern's movements. Myer's code was ternary (three symbols). However, only two of these symbols were used for letters, making it largely binary. The third symbol only appeared in control characters. Each character consisted of a combination of three basic motions (elements). The neutral position was the flagman holding his device vertically and motionless above his head. The first motion was initiated by bringing the device downward on the signalman's right side and then quickly returning it to its upright position. The second motion brought the device down on the left side and then returned it to the starting position. The third motion lowered the device in front of the signalman, then restored it to its vertical position. Like Morse code, but unlike Myer's original code, this binary code did not have a fixed length for each character. For instance, i was coded as ""2"", but d was coded as ""222"". Myer's 1866 manual also includes a 3-element fixed length code using four elements, and the 1872 manual has a 3-element fixed length code using three elements. There is little sign that these codes were widely used. The 1872 manual includes a variable length code using four elements which Myer says was used by the Army, but is superseded.",Normal

"Macushi is an indigenous language of the Carib family spoken in Brazil, Guyana and Venezuela. It is also referred to as Makushi, Makusi, Macuxi, Macusi, Macussi, Teweya or Teueia. It is the most populous of the Cariban languages. According to Instituto Socioambiental, the Macushi population is at an estimated 43,192, with 33,603 in Brazil, 9,500 in Guyana and 89 in Venezuela. In Brazil, the Macushi populations are located around northeastern Roraima, Rio Branco, Contingo, Quino, Pium and Mau rivers. Macuxi speakers in Brazil, however, are only estimated at 15,000. Crevels (2012:182) lists Macushi as “potentially endangered”, while it is listed on the UNESCO Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger as “vulnerable”. Its language status is at 6b (Threatened). The Macushi communities live in areas of language contact: Portuguese in Brazil, English in Guyana and Wapixana (another indigenous language). Abbott (1991) describes Macushi as having OVS word order, with SOV word order being used to highlight the subject. Based on information provided by anthropologist Paulo Santilli for Instituto Socioambiental, the Macuxi people have faced adversity since the 18th century, due to the presence of non-indigenous groups. Located at the frontier of Brazil and Guyana, generations have been forced to migrate from their territory due to the establishment of Portuguese settlements, the influx of extractivists (who came for the rubber) and developers (who came to extract metals and precious stones), and more recently, the insurgence of “grileiros” that counterfeit land titles in order to take over and sell the land. These settlers set up mission villages and farms. Towards the last decades of the 19th century, as the rubber industry boomed and local administration obtained autonomy, the regionals, referring to the merchants and extractivists, advanced the colonial expansion. Subsequently, forced migration continued to occur due to the rise of cattle-raising in the region. Villages were abandoned and escape plans were hatched due to the arrival of the colonizers. To this day, these memories are still preserved in the oral histories of the Macushi people. Since early 20th century, local political leaders have also stepped up to champion for their land rights. Nowadays, the Macushi territory in Brazil consists of three territorial blocks: Raposa Serra do Sol Indigenous Territory (the most extensive and populated), San Marcos Indigenous Territory and small areas that surround isolated villages in the extreme northwest of the Macushi Territory. In the 1970s, Macushi political leaders started to step up, acting as mediators between their indigenous community members as well as the agents of national society. While these areas were officially recognized and demarcated as official indigenous territories in 1993, however, it has not been a smooth road for the Macushi communities. Since then, the Brazilian government has set up school and hospitals for the Macushi community. Nasality also occurs, and is transcribed with a  mark. The suprasegmental system consists of a high and low or unmarked pitch at the word level”, such as in: átí ‘you go’ and ‘àtí’ ‘he goes’. High pitch is considered the marked pitch, and can be found on the final, penultimate or antepenultimate syllable of the word. Macuxi numerals precede the noun they modify. When both the demonstrative and numeral occur before the noun, it is irrelevant to the semantic value of the noun. It is also acceptable for the numeral to start a nominal clause. saki-naŋ two-NOM-PL a’anai cornstalk yepuupî skin imî-rîî-seŋ ripe-DET-NOM saki-naŋ a’anai yepuupî imî-rîî-seŋ two-NOM-PL cornstalk skin ripe-DET-NOM ‘Two ears of corn are ripe.’ saakrîrî-on-koŋ four-NOM-POSS-PL ma-ni those kanoŋ guava saakrîrî-on-koŋ ma-ni kanoŋ four-NOM-POSS-PL those guava 'Those four guavas.

"The Dungeons & Dragons Gazetteer is a supplement to the 3rd edition of the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. The Dungeons & Dragons Gazetteer details the lands of Greyhawk, the 3rd edition core world of Dungeons & Dragons. The book's introduction noted that the D&D game setting is located on Oerth, more specifically on the continent of Oerik, in its easternmost portion called the Flanaess. The book then goes on the briefly cover the history of the region, as well as an atlas that providesa a short description of the most important kingdoms. There is also a chapter on geography, and a listing of some of the most influential groups in the region. In 1980, D&D co-creator Gary Gygax released the World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting, a 32-page gazetteer of Gygax's World of Greyhawk. This was updated several times over the next decade. After the takeover of TSR by Wizards of the Coast and the development of a third edition of D&D, the company published a new Gazetteer in 2000 using the same 32-page format originally used by Gygax twenty years previously. The Dungeons & Dragons Gazetteer was written by Gary Holian, Erik Mona, Sean Reynolds, and Frederick Weining, with cover art was by Sam Wood, with interior art by Dennis Cramer. In Issue 24 of the French role-playing magazine Backstab, Cyril Pasteau noted that 32 pages was not enough to ""synthesize a universe as vast as that of Grehyawk."" Pasteau concluded, ""Unfortunately, there is not enough material for a beginning gamemaster to build their own campaign.""",Normal
"49°47′10″N 22°46′26″E﻿ ﻿49.78611°N 22.77389°E﻿ 49.78611; 22.77389 Przemyśl fortress (Polish: Twierdza Przemyśl) was a series of fortifications constructed at Przemyśl by the Austro-Hungarian Empire from the mid 19th century until the First World War. It was constructed in sections, depending on the diplomatic relations between Austria and the Russian Empire, and saw extensive combat during World War I. Originally captured by the Russian Army, it was recaptured by the German Army in mid-1915. Afterwards the ruined fortifications lost their military significance. The initial construction plans for 41 entrenchments were drawn up at the beginning of the 19th century; however, good relations between Austria and the Russian Empire, meant that construction did not go ahead until 1854, with the outbreak of the Crimean War. Nineteen of the 41 entrenchments were completed, with nine more under construction when relations again improved in 1855, and construction was halted. Until 1878, no work was undertaken on the fortress. In 1878, the barracks, magazines and inter-connecting roads were completed, as well as nine earth forts in light of the Bosnian Crisis. Three years later, in 1881, these temporary earth works were converted into permanent solid fortifications, and by 1910, infantry fortifications had been added. When war broke out in 1914, the fortress was further reinforced with trenches, more barracks and artillery emplacements. After the war, with much of its defences destroyed, the fortress fell into disrepair, and no longer had any military significance. The area was fortified again in 1940, with modern bunkers built as part of the Soviet Molotov Line, but these new fortifications had little to do with the original Austro-Hungarian fortress. According to Prit Buttar, ""...the huge fortress of Przemyśl...had been heavily fortified by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in order to protect the approaches to the Carpathian passes. It was also substantially provisioned, so that a garrison could survive a prolonged siege if necessary. In addition to the central fortress, twenty-five smaller forts and twelve major artillery emplacements surrounded Przemyśl. Provided that it was garrisoned adequately, the Austro-Hungarians believed, it would constitute a formidable obstacle to any Russian advance."" On the outbreak of World War I, the fortress was only garrisoned by a small force of five infantry battalions, artillery and sappers. Defence preparations began on August 2, 1914, the civilians were evacuated on September 4, and the Austro-Hungarian Army's HQ followed on September 15. Two days later, on September 17, 1914 the Russian army laid siege to the fortress, sealing it off totally by September 26. The siege continued into October, with a truce being offered and subsequently refused on October 5. Bombardment intensified in the next few days, and on October 7 the Russians assaulted the fortress at 3.00am. The Russians lost 10,000 personnel, 3—4,000 of them killed, and by October 9 a relief force had pushed them back to the San river. The fortress was later abandoned by all but a small defensive force on November 4 as it was in danger of being outflanked. The remaining troops were left to tie down the Russian forces for as long as possible, and when they were surrounded for a second time they sortied continuously through late November and December. Food shortages through the spring of 1915 led to the butchering of 13,000 horses to feed the garrison, and by March 14, 1915 the outer fortification had been captured or destroyed by the Russian army. At this point, in the face of low food and morale, the fortress commander, General Hermann Kusmanek von Burgneustädten decided to break out. His forces, however, were bogged down and repulsed by the Russians. Documents were burned on March 19 and the artillery was destroyed on March 22, and later that same day 119,000 troops surrendered to the Russian forces. Tsar Nicholas II visited the fortress on April 25, 1915 as the Russians adapted it for their purposes. By May 16, however, German forces had reached the fortress, and after laying siege, they captured in on June 5, 1915, led by General von Kneussl. Afterwards slight repairs were made, however the mostly ruined fortifications no longer had serious military significance. They may have been used briefly during the fighting in the course of the Polish-Ukrainian War in the 1920s and very briefly during the Second World War.",Normal

"GNU IceCat, formerly known as GNU IceWeasel, is a completely free version of the Mozilla Firefox web browser distributed by the GNU Project. It is compatible with Linux, Windows, Android and macOS. IceCat is released as a part of GNUzilla, GNU's rebranding of a code base that used to be the Mozilla Application Suite. As an internet suite, GNUzilla also includes a mail and newsgroup program, and an HTML composer. Mozilla produces free and open-source software, but the binaries include trademarked artwork. The GNU Project attempts to keep IceCat in synchronization with upstream development of Firefox (long-term support versions) while removing all trademarked artwork and non-free add-ons. It also maintains a large list of free software plugins. In addition, it includes several security and privacy features not found in the mainline Firefox browser. The Mozilla Corporation holds the trademark to the Firefox name and denies the use of the name ""Firefox"" to unofficial builds that fall outside certain guidelines. Unless distributions use the binary files supplied by Mozilla, fall within the stated guidelines, or else have special permission, they must compile the Firefox source with a compile-time option enabled that creates binaries without the official branding of Firefox and related artwork, using either the built-in free artwork, or artwork provided at compile time. This policy led to a long debate within the Debian Project in 2004 and 2005. During this debate, the name ""Iceweasel"" was coined to refer to rebranded versions of Firefox. The first known use of the name in this context is by Nathanael Nerode, in reply to Eric Dorland's suggestion of ""Icerabbit"". It was intended as a parody of ""Firefox"". Iceweasel was subsequently used as the example name for a rebranded Firefox in the Mozilla Trademark Policy, and became the most commonly used name for a hypothetical rebranded version of Firefox. By January 1, 2005, rebranding was being referred to as the ""Iceweasel route"". In August 2005, the GNUzilla project adopted the GNU IceWeasel name for a rebranded distribution of Firefox that made no references to nonfree plugins. The term ""ice weasel"" appeared earlier in a line which cartoonist Matt Groening fictionally attributed to Friedrich Nietzsche: ""Love is a snowmobile racing across the tundra and then suddenly it flips over, pinning you underneath. At night, the ice weasels come."" Debian was originally given permission to use the trademarks, and adopted the Firefox name. However, because the artwork in Firefox had a proprietary copyright license at the time, which was not compatible with the Debian Free Software Guidelines, the substituted logo had to remain. In 2006, Mozilla withdrew their permission for Debian to use the Firefox name due to significant changes to the browser that Mozilla deemed outside the boundaries of its policy, changes which Debian felt were important enough to keep, and Debian revived the Iceweasel name in its place. Subsequently, on 23 September 2007, one of the developers of the GNU IceWeasel package announced that the name would be changed to GNU IceCat from IceWeasel in the next release, so as to avoid confusion with Debian's separately maintained, unrelated rebranding of Firefox. The name change took place as planned and IceCat is the current name. IceCat was ported to the Firefox 3 codebase during Google Summer of Code of 2008. GNU IceCat is freely downloadable as source code from the GNU project. Some Linux Distributions offer binary and source packages through their repositories, such as Trisquel, Parabola GNULinux-libre and Fedora. Gnu Icecat is now distributed for Windows Mac OS and GNULinux.  GNU IceCat is available for macOS 10.4 and higher.  Additionally, GNU IceCat is also available for Windows. IceCat includes additional security features, such as the option to block third party zero-length image files resulting in third-party cookies, also known as web bugs (This feature is available in Firefox 1.0, 1.5, and 3.0, but the UI option was absent on 2.0). GNU IceCat also provides warnings for URL redirection. In version 3.0.2-g1, the certificate of a certificate authority CAcert.org has been added to the list of trusted root certificates. Concern about that decision has been raised in a discussion on the savannah-hackers-public mailing list. The GNU LibreJS extension detects and blocks non-free non-trivial JavaScript. IceCat also has functionality to set a different user agent string each for different domains in about:config. For example, setting a mobile user agent string for a desired DNS domain would make it possible to view the mobile version of a website on a desktop operating system. Gnuzilla is available under the MPLGPLLGPL tri-license that Mozilla used for source code. Unlike Mozilla, IceCat's default icons are under the same tri-license.",Normal

"Within the Latter Day Saint movement, the ""Articles of Faith"" is a statement of beliefs composed by Joseph Smith as part of an 1842 letter sent to ""Long"" John Wentworth, editor of the Chicago Democrat, and first published in the Latter Day Saint newspaper Times and Seasons. It is a concise listing of thirteen fundamental doctrines of Mormonism. Most Latter Day Saint denominations view the articles as an authoritative statement of basic theology. Some denominations, such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), have adopted the articles as scripture (see Pearl of Great Price). For some sects, the Articles of Faith are known collectively as ""An Epitome of Faith and Doctrine"". The full text is reproduced here. Later alterations to the text made by the LDS Church are indicated by strikethroughs and brackets. Articles one through four read as follows: The first four articles state basic doctrines of the Latter Day Saint movement. The first is often understood to state the doctrine of the Godhead. The second specifically rejects the teaching of original sin. The third states belief in the atonement of Christ taking effect for potentially all individuals (as opposed to double predestination) conditional on following the laws and ordinances of the Gospel (as opposed to unconditional election). The fourth states the core principles and ordinances of faith, repentance, baptism and confirmation for the gift of the Holy Ghost. The fifth and sixth articles state beliefs regarding how the church should be organized; in particular, the requirement of ordination to the priesthood and prophetic governance through the use of priesthood keys to administer valid and licit ordinances (as opposed to a priesthood of all believers). The belief in a church polity including apostles, prophets and evangelists is also stated. Articles 7–9 state beliefs in sources of revelation: in gifts of the Spirit, in the Bible and Book of Mormon, and in continuing revelation: Articles 10–12 state beliefs in the gathering of Israel, establishes ethics for religious freedom, and proper conduct for church members in society: The thirteenth article states beliefs in how one should conduct oneself. The ""admonition of Paul"" referenced appears to be Philippians 4:8. The Articles of Faith are similar to, and may have been partially derived from, an earlier eight-article creed written by Oliver Cowdery: Subsequent early creeds predating the Wentworth Letter included a five-article creed by Joseph Young, an eighteen-article creed by Parley P. Pratt, a nineteen-article creed by Orson Pratt and a sixteen-article creed by Orson Hyde. A similar but altered version of the creed with fourteen articles was published by James H. Flanigan in April 1849 in England, and quoted in some other nineteenth-century sources. This inserted an additional article after the tenth (""We believe in the literal resurrection of the body, and that the dead in Christ will rise first, and that the rest of the dead live not again until the thousand years are expired.""), and made various other changes, such as giving a longer list of gifts of the spirit in the seventh article, appending ""the Lord's supper"" to the list of ordinances in the fourth article, mentioning ""all other good books"" in the eighth article, and appending ""looking forward to the 'recompense of reward.'"" to the last article, amongst other changes. This version is sometimes mistaken as being the original. A significantly longer, extended revision of the creed, which contains twenty-five articles and is known as the Articles of Faith and Practice, is used by the Church of Christ (Temple Lot), the Church of Christ (Fettingite), the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message and the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message (Assured Way). The Word of the Lord, regarded as scriptural by the Fettingites and by both Elijah Message groups, declares these articles to be inspired and forbids changing their wording. The version currently published by the Temple Lot group has a different version of Article 20 to the version used by the other groups, denouncing cohabitation and same-sex marriage in addition to plural marriage.",Normal
"Michael McColgan is an American musician, and is a founding member and former lead singer of the American punk band Street Dogs and a founding member and former original lead singer of the American Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys. McColgan was born in the Savin Hill area of Dorchester, Massachusetts, and attended Catholic Memorial High School in West Roxbury, Massachusetts. His interest in music began while he sang in the school's choir. McColgan joined the U.S. Army in 1989 and served in 4th Battalion 82nd Field Artillery, Charlie Battery in the first Gulf war before becoming a founding member of the Dropkick Murphys in 1996. While McColgan was with the Murphys, they released one full-length album, Do or Die. According to McColgan, he always wanted to be a member of the Boston Fire Department like his uncle and role-model, Kevin O'Toole (the subject of ""Kevin J. O'Toole"" on State of Grace). When McColgan left the band in 1998 to pursue this dream, he was replaced as lead singer by Al Barr, ex-vocalist for The Bruisers. Regarding his 1998 departure, McColgan said ""I have no misgivings, no regrets…and there are no bad feelings...I still talk to those guys."" The song ""Two Angry Kids"" on State of Grace is reportedly a reminiscing of the times spent with Dropkick Murphys frontman Ken Casey. McColgan in 2002 started a new band, Street Dogs, and shortly left the fire department to again pursue music full-time. The Street Dogs featured members such as Johnny Rioux and Joe Sirois (of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones). Guitarist Marcus Hollar sent McColgan an e-mail saying that if his new band ever needed a guitarist, that he was available. McColgan gave Hollar an audition and asked him to join the band. The Street Dogs toured with Social Distortion, Flogging Molly, Tiger Army, The Bouncing Souls, The Adolescents, The Offspring, The Bones, The Swingin' Utters, and Anti-Flag. They also appeared on Warped Tour and had a successful headlining tour at the end of 2005. The band's third album, Fading American Dream, was released October 24, 2006. In support of the album, the band went out on The Gold Tour from October through December with The Bouncing Souls. In February 2008, it was announced that the Street Dogs signed on to Hellcat Records and the band released their fourth album, State of Grace, on July 8, 2008. The Street Dogs released their fifth studio album, Street Dogs, on August 31, 2010. In 2013, McColgan announced a new project, FM359, with Johnny Rioux and founding Dropkick Murphys guitarist Rick Barton. FM359 is considered a non-religious gospel project, and their debut full-length, Truth, Love and Liberty, was released on January 14, 2014 through Pirates Press Records. On February 13, 2020, McColgan and Rioux issued a statement via Facebook announcing that Street Dogs were disbanding after 17 years. The group announced a small St. Patrick's Day tour with Flogging Molly and Mad Caddies as well as two headlining shows in March 2020 in Long Beach, CA, with their final show being held in their hometown of Boston, MA; however, all of the shows were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Panderodus Is an extinct genus of jawless fish belonging to the order Conodonta. This genus had a long temporal range, surviving from the middle Ordovician to late Devonian. In 2021, extremely rare body fossils of Panderodus from the Waukesha Biota were described, and it revealed that Panderodus had a more thick body compared to the more slender bodies of more advanced conodonts. It also revealed that this conodont was a macrophagous predator, meaning it went after large prey. Panderodus was first described in 1959 on the basis of its tooth structures known as conodont elements. In 1985 a poorly preserved body fossil of the species Panderodus unicostatus was discovered in the Waukesha biota, a fossil site located in southeastern Wisconsin. At the time of its discovery this specimen was the one of only two known conodont body fossils, the other one being a body fossil possibly belonging to Clydagnathus which was found in 1983 from Carboniferous rocks of Scotland. More body fossils have since been found, like a large fossil of the species Promissum pulchrum found in the upper Ordovician soom shale in South Africa in the 1990s, but only 11 total are so far known. The Waukesha fossil was known to have belonged to Panderodus, but wasn't fully analyzed until 2021. This fossil revealed that at least P. unicostatus had a thicker body then most other conodonts, and had more primitive shark-like teeth. These features suggest P. unicostatus was a macrophagous hunter, something rare in vertebrates from the Ordovician-Silurian (due to the fact that many of them had no jaws). Gnathostomata Cyclostomata †Furnishina †Problematoconites †Cordylodus †Besselodus †Panderodus †Paracordylodus †Promissum †Notiodella †Erismodus †Clydagnathus †Idiognathodus Panderodus is a conodont of the family Distacodontidae. Its closest relative is Curtognathus. This conodont was more primitive then others, unlike other conodonts whose teeth formed into a complex sieve, the teeth of Panderodus were large and shark like. The teeth probably had their own roles, like locking prey into place. Conodonts themselves are an unusual grouping, as for more than a hundred years we only knew of them by their teeth structures. Conodonts are classed in the grouping Agnatha alongside jawless fish like lampreys and hagfish. Conodonts such as Panderodus were typically small to medium sized, elongate, marine vertebrates that look similar to eels today. These creatures have been classified under a large amount of animals, however now they are recognized as agnathan vertebrates. Another study found that some species of Panderodus exhibited body parts that would mean they would be venomous. This makes these conodonts some of the earliest known venomous organisms in the fossil record.",Normal

"The Dickson Range is a subrange of the Chilcotin Ranges subset of the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains in southwest-central British Columbia. It is located just west of the town of Gold Bridge between the valley of Slim Creek to the north (a tributary of Gun Creek) and Downton Lake Reservoir to the south. At its eastern foot is Gun Lake; its western limit is at a pass between Slim Creek and Nichols Creek (which feeds the upper Bridge River just before it enters Downton Lake) near the pass which separates the Bridge River basin from that of the Lord River, which feeds the Taseko Lakes. The range is approximately 3,500km2 (1350 sq mi) in area and about 35km in length. Its highest Peak, Dickson Peak (a.k.a. Mount Dickson) is a stunning pyramidal peak towards the eastern end of the range, overlooking the middle Bridge River Valley to the east and also visible on the canyon road between Gold Bridge and Bralorne. The drop from Dickson's summit to Downton Lake is c.2075m (6775') in only 5km (3.1mi). Just southeast of Dickson Peak is Mount Penrose 2634m (8642ft), which a cockscomb-like summit which stands immediately above Gun Lake and its resort community. Penrose was named for Republican Senator Boies Penrose (November 1, 1860 – December 31, 1921) who climbed it in the 1920s while hunting with famed local big-game outfitter W.G. (Bill) Manson. Penrose was an avid outdoorsman and another mountain in the Flathead area of Montana also bears his name. Penrose is the best-known summit in the Dickson after Dickson Peak, but farther east along the range are Scherle Peak 2677m (8783ft) and Tillworth Mountain 2,631m (8,632ft). A peak named Sorcerer 2,602m (8,537ft) occupies a separate ridge on the northwest end of the range, adjacent to the Leckie Range just north across Slim Creek. To the north and northeast of the Dickson Range is the Spruce Lake Protected Area a.k.a. the ""South Chilcotin"", while to the northwest is Ts'ilʔos Provincial Park.",Normal
"Adelaida Martinez (born July 24, 1963), better known by her stage name the Real Roxanne, is an American female hip hop MC who recorded for Select Records. Martinez was born in Brooklyn, New York. In the 1980s, she, the producer of Roxanne Shante, and others were engaged in the Roxanne Wars, a series of answer records inspired by UTFO's hit song ""Roxanne, Roxanne"", being the officially sanctioned artist in response to all of the answer records. She scored her biggest hit in 1986 by teaming up with Howie Tee on the single ""Bang Zoom (Let's Go-Go),"" which reached No. 11 in the UK Singles Chart, her only UK Top 40 hit to date. The role of the Real Roxanne was originally filled by a different woman, Elease Jack, who recorded the first single The Real Roxanne under the character's name. Meanwhile, Martinez claims to have been introduced to UTFO in a fashion very similar to the Roxanne story. Already acquainted with Paul Anthony George, a member of Full Force, the group that produced UTFO: Ironic enough, I briefly met Doc Ice and Kangol (Kid) at the Albee Square Mall in Brooklyn, and, like Roxanne, I paid them no mind when they tried to get their rap on. All this was taking place while Paul Anthony and I were just becoming friends. Full Force was looking for someone to play the permanent role of Roxanne, even though they had already cut the track with someone they picked out of a club, whom, by the way, had absolutely no rap experience. They utilized her for an answer back to outbid Roxanne Shante's track. It seems that while they tried to create this character, they were having issues with this individual and her mother, so I was told, and that's when I was asked by Paul Anthony if I would audition for the guys, and I said sure, and I did. And, from there, I kept on walking in the shoes of THE REAL Roxanne!' This biographical article related to hip hop music in the United States is a stub.

"Peter Getting Out of Nick's Pool is a 1966 acrylic-on-canvas painting by the British pop art artist David Hockney. It depicts the rear view of a naked man climbing out of a swimming pool outside a contemporary house. It is held at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. Hockney moved from England to California in 1964, drawn by its sleek modernist aesthetic and warm Mediterranean climate. In 1966, while teaching at UCLA, Hockney met the American art student Peter Schlesinger. The two became lovers, and Hockney started painting a series of pool pictures, often featuring Schlesinger. A few of these, such as Peter Getting Out of Nick's Pool (1966), A Bigger Splash (1967) and Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) (1972), later achieved iconic status. On 15 November 2018, the latter set a world record for the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction by a living artist. The painting measures 152cm ×152cm (60in ×60in). It depicts the communal pool of the apartment block at 1145 Larrabee Street, Hollywood, north of Sunset Boulevard, which was then the home of art dealer Nicholas Wilder, and shows a naked Schlesinger, then 18 years old, climbing up and out of the pool. Hockney, in his characteristic style, simplifies and flattens the image, and the rippling surface of the water is abstracted into wavy white lines on blue, similar to a comic or an advertisement. The straight lines in the painting were created using masking tape. The work has a border of un-primed canvas, like a photograph, which Hockney says he left ""to make the picture look more like a painting"". The figure in the painting is based on a polaroid photograph Hockney took of Schlesinger standing up against the hood of his own MG car. Interviewed about the painting in 2012, Schlesinger laughed about it, saying ""That’s why the part under the water isn't painted well—because it was just invented."" In 1967, Hockney's painting won the John Moores Painting Prize at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. The painting was acquired as a bequest from Sir John Moores who in 1957, established the eponymous biannual award and subsequently often purchased the winning entry and then presented the work to the museum. Moores purchased this work in 1967, and presented it to the museum in 1968. The picture remains in the Walker's permanent collection.",Normal
"The Lost Children of the Alleghenies were two missing brothers from the Appalachia region of the United States in 1856. George and Joseph Cox, then aged seven and five respectively, disappeared from their home in Pavia, Pennsylvania, on April 24, 1856. Their dead bodies were found several days later in the surrounding woods and they were buried in the Mount Union cemetery in nearby Lovely. There is a small memorial to them in the Spruce Hollow forest in Blue Knob State Park, Pennsylvania. George, 7, and Joseph, 5, were the sons of Samuel and Susannah Cox. The Cox family lived in a cabin built by Samuel for his wife and children. At this time old-growth logging had not yet begun in this area of Pennsylvania and the area was still heavily forested. During the morning of April 24, 1856, Samuel Cox heard his dog barking in the forest and thought that it must have trapped a squirrel in a tree. Samuel retrieved his rifle and headed into the woods. It is thought that while Samuel was gone, the boys must have strayed from home to follow their father. Susannah thought that Samuel had taken the boys with him. It was only when Samuel returned without them that they realized their children were gone. They called for the boys, but received no replies. Samuel went for help from his nearest neighbors and by that evening more than one hundred men were searching for the children. Fires were lit in the forest in the hope that the boys would see one and approach. Nearly a thousand people showed up to search the next day. A nearby stream, Bob's Creek, was surging with spring snow melt and it was thought that there was no way the boys could have crossed to the other side without drowning. A search of the creek was performed but the boys were not found. On April 26, suspicion fell on Samuel and Susannah Cox. It was thought that they might have murdered their children in the hope of gathering donations from a sympathetic population. The Cox cabin and garden were searched but no bodies were located. The searchers went so far as to bring in a dowser and a witch from Somerset County. The dowser found nothing and the witch, despite claiming to know the children's location, led a search team through the woods for hours without turning up anything. A local farmer, Jacob Dibert, heard about the missing children and remarked to his wife that he wished to be able to dream of the boys' location. On May 2, 1856, he had a dream in which he walked a path through the woods past a dead deer, a child's shoe and a fallen birch tree and eventually to a copse of birch trees in a small ravine. Here he found the bodies of the Cox boys. The dream reoccurred on the two following nights. Dibert told no one but his wife about the dream; however, he felt that the dream was prophetic and on May 7 he told his brother-in-law Harrison Whysong. Whysong recognised elements from Dibert's dream and the two men decided to make a search, culminating in the discovery of the bodies just as the dream had described - under birch trees in a small ravine reached along a track with a dead deer, a child's shoe, and a fallen birch. In 1906, for the 50th anniversary of the event, the community of Pavia took up donations for a Lost Children of the Alleghenies Monument to honor the Cox family. In 1910, they erected the monument at the spot where Joseph and George Cox were found over 50 years earlier. Alison Krauss released a song written by Julie Lee and John Pennell about the story entitled ""Jacob's Dream"".",Normal
"The Austrian Army Sports Association (German: Österreichischer Heeressportverband, short: ÖHSV) was founded on October 19, 1967 in the theatre of the Maria-Theresien-Barrack during the general assembly. Responsible therefore was the Federal Minister of Defense, Dr. Georg Prader. His ministerial order says, ""In this organisation sports officers and non-commissioned officers should find a new field of activity which is available in their leisure time."" The Austrian Army Sports Association will always be making an effort to maintain the contacts and connections to other civil sport federations. The biggest sponsor of this organisation is Austrian Armed Forces. In 1930 the Austrian Army Sports Association was founded as an association of the Ministry of War. A precursor already existed in 1921. It was a garrison sports association of the Austrian Armed Forces in the First Austrian Republic. The structure was very similar to today. This organisation stood out of politics in the First Austrian Republic and in the corporate state. In 1935 the Austrian Army Sports Association withdrew from civil events. The new focus was set on military competitions. In 1938 the organisation was dissolved. During the occupation period by the Allies, after the World War II a sports club founded from the B-Constabulary in Tyrol. This club started in 1956 as the first Army Sports Association, followed by clubs in Graz, Salzburg and Vienna. The idea to create a new governing body rose up. Civil organisations feared the expansion of a military sports organisation analogical to organisations from the Eastern Bloc. They were afraid to lose athletes and financial promotions. The Federal Minister of Defense Dr. Georg Prader ordered in 1965 the founding of the Austrian Army Sports Association. The reestablishment happened on October 19, 1967. Since 1992 the Austrian Army Sports Association divided into nine national associations and 90 sport categories. The organisation hosted or highly supported international championships several times. Some examples are Ironman Austria, Biathlon World Championships 2005, Marc-Aurel-March or the Austrian part of the Vienna–Bratislava–Budapest Supermarathon. In 1988 the biathlete Warrant Officer Alfred Eder from Saalfelden occupied the 4th place at the Winter Olympics 1988 in Calgary. In the year of the 25th anniversary Austrian Army Sports Association athletes got two silver medals and one gold medal participating at the Winter Olympics 1992 in Albertville as a present. Ten years later another athlete cheered about an Olympic medal. Christoph Bieler (HSV Sparkasse Absam) reached bronze in the team competition 4 x 5km (Nordic combination) at the Winter Olympics 2002 in Salt Lake City. Bieler achieved gold in the same competition on February 15, at the Winter Olympics 2006 in Turin. Over 60 sportsmen from the Army Sports Association are part of Olympic Games. More than 600 medals were won in World, European and Military championships, European championships of the CISM, also World, European and Alp cups. Additionally, 40 World and European records and two world best performances were set. More than 3.000 State and Austrian titles are the result from specific promotion of youth, implemented by the front men of the Austrian Army Sports Association the country representative for a type of sport. In 2004 the Austrian Army Sports Association counted the highest membership figure with over 30.000 persons. On June 26, 2014, the current presidium was elected at the association days in Hochfilzen. The next election will be on the association days in 2018. The committee consists of one counsellor from each province, an assessor from the Federal Ministry for National Defence and Sport and two auditors. On the association days, every counsellor is allowed to bring up two more counsellors. All these people including the presidium can vote to make decisions at these days. The country representative persons are elected from the committee after necessity. Their responsibilities are the coordination of high-performance and competitive sports. They should also coordinate the whole youth level of the Austrian Army sports in their section. Courses and the execution of Austrian Army Sports Association championships are also included in their activities. Their working area covered the whole Federal territory. A country representative for a type of sport need the following requirements and should fulfill these activities: The Austrian Army Sports Association elected the following country representatives for a type of sport (as of January 2017). Since 1968 the Austrian Army Sports Association held yearly association days. Most of the time this event takes two days. For decisions like a new presidium, or other important judgements these days are very important. In 2017 the association day will be combined with the ceremony of the occasion ""50 years Austrian Army Sports Association"". It is planned to enthuse about 300 people with Austrian top athletes, interviews, an anniversary publication and a lot more. This event will be on May 31 and June 1, 2017. In connection with the 49th association days the sportsman of the year 2015 Sebastian Graser (ParachutingHSV Red Bull Salzburg) and the sportswoman of the year 2015 Susanne Menda (WeightliftingHSV Langenlebarn) were honoured.",Normal
"Da Costa v Jones (1778) 2 Cowp 729 is a landmark English contract law case. A wager was made on the sex of a certain individual. The individual concerned was a French national known as Monsieur le Chevalier D'Eon. D'Eon was a captain in the Dragoons and had served France in diplomatic postings firstly in Russia and later in England. He had been awarded the Cross of Saint-Louis during the reign of Louis XV in recognition of his service in the Dragoons and his diplomatic work. In the reign of Louis XV, the king established a spy service which was known as the Secret. The existence of Secret was not known to the king's ministers: It reported directly to him. During his time in England he fell out of favour with two of the king's ministers (a dispute having started over the level of his expenses), leading to his replacement by another diplomat. He continued to serve his country as a spy and therefore reported indirectly to the king. He held concerns that if he were to return to France he could have been imprisoned on the Bastille. Over time, he made comments which threw doubt on his true sex. Being well known in London, comments about his sex became the subject of talk and comment in the press. In turn this led to numerous wagering contracts being entered into. The wager in the Da Costa v Jones was not the first to have come before the courts. In an earlier case (also before Lord Mansfield) it was held, on the evidence provided by witnesses (including two doctors) to a jury that Monsieur D'Eon was female. It was not until this case that the Court (Lord Mansfield) considered the public policy issues arising from this form of wager. Lord Mansfield held the contract was ineffective, on the basis that it was not in good faith. This article relating to law in the United Kingdom, or its constituent jurisdictions, is a stub.

"Anima Animus is the third studio album by British duo the Creatures, consisting of Siouxsie Sioux and musician Budgie, released in 1999. The title of the album was inspired by Carl Jung's concept of anima and animus (""the woman inside the man, the man inside the woman""). Recorded in France and England, the album was a departure from previous Creatures works. While still retaining a percussive element, the music had a more urban sound. Upon its release, the record was well received by critics. Anima Animus was later hailed by peer PJ Harvey, who selected it in her Top 10 Albums of 1999. The pair began developing ideas for the songs in 1995. ""Exterminating Angel"" was composed that autumn in France. Siouxsie and Budgie had purchased a lot of equipment and decided to work at their house near Toulouse. The original title of the album was Gifthorse, then Mount Venus, before the duo changed their minds to finally opt for Anima Animus, which was a reference to Jung's theory of ""The Man Inside The Woman and The Woman Inside The Man"". In 1996, no major label was interested in the demos, as they were judged as too avant-garde and not commercial enough. Siouxsie and Budgie then decided to finance the project themselves, and began recording on their own. They produced the album with the assistance of Steve Lyon, Steve Levine and Warne Livesey. Four songs (""2nd Floor"", ""Another Planet"", ""Say"" and ""I Was Me"") were recorded in England. While staying in London, they met Doug Hart, who owned an independent label, Hydrogen Records. With his help, the Creatures set up their own label called Sioux Records, and became an independent act. The album was finally mixed in New York. The portraits of Siouxsie and Budgie for the sleeves were designed and conceived by French artists Pierre et Gilles in Paris in 1997. Lucy O'Brien described ""2nd Floor"" as ""a driving, thumping dancefloor thing that exudes a brooding glamour"". Siouxsie said that the song was about the state a person was after having too many Vodka Gimlets. ""It's when you still want more, when you want the party to continue and it's beyond being sensible. I remember times when I was the one person left in a place, and the euphoria that goes along with it. '2nd Floor' was my idea of what a private drinking bar would be, that was open all the time."" She also stated that ""There's something very religious about bars. They're like altars. The lighting. The colour of the bottles. Having a drink. It's like Santa's Grotto time."" ""Don't Go to Sleep Without Me"" is a ""ghostly lullaby"". The first single, ""2nd Floor"", was issued in late 1998, shortly after the four-track EP Eraser Cut. The second single, ""Say"", featured two unreleased B-sides: the acoustic ""Broken"" and the atmospheric ""All She Could Ask For"". The latter song opened their 1999 concerts. All of this extra material was later included on the U.S. Retrace compilation. Anima Animus was released on both CD and double 10-inch vinyl record. The album was also released on Spotify. The album was well received by critics. The Times gave it 8 out of 10 and wrote: ""Siouxsie, has rarely been in better voice. The opening track, ""2nd Floor"" is a fantastically knowing melodrama, riding a techno pulse, while the ominous, epic ""Exterminating Angel"" pursues its prey in lamplit streets. It's entrancing, hypnotic and inventive"". The Sunday Times praised it in glowing terms: ""Siouxsie's voice has lost none of its ability to seduce and unsettle. The sound is percussive, defined by Budgie's supple rhythm work. ""Exterminating Angel"" is exquisitely menacing, while the sinuous ""Another Planet"" grows to a shuddering climax."" Uncut reviewer Chris Roberts rated the album 4 out of 5, saying: ""Sioux's always been at her best as a harsh declaimer  but there are phases where she whispers, breathes, reaches for vulnerability"", before concluding ""The Creatures have jettisoned comfort and are phoning home from a new end zone. Anima Animus crackles."" All songs written and composed by Siouxsie and Budgie.",Normal

"Hugo John Smelter Young (13 October 1938 – 22 September 2003) was a British journalist and columnist and senior political commentator at The Guardian. Born in Sheffield into an old recusant Roman Catholic family, he was head boy at Ampleforth College in North Yorkshire during his youth; later, he read law at Balliol College, Oxford, and worked for the Yorkshire Post in Leeds from 1961. In 1963, he spent a year as a Harkness Fellow in the US and he spent the next year working as a congressional fellow. In 1965, Young returned to the United Kingdom. He was recruited by Denis Hamilton of The Sunday Times. In his second year there, he became chief leader writer, a position he kept until 1977. From 1973–84, he was also the paper's political editor. He established a Sunday column, ""Inside Politics"", that made him famous. Beginning in 1981, he also held the position of joint deputy editor. However, Young's relationship with The Sunday Times cooled notably when Rupert Murdoch took over the paper in 1981. The conflict culminated in a series of battles with editor Andrew Neil, particularly over the US invasion of Grenada in 1983. This ultimately led to Young's leaving The Sunday Times and joining The Guardian in 1984. Young continued to write a twice-weekly political column at The Guardian until his death. Young was a strong proponent of European integration, and sharply expressed his disappointment with the British government's eurosceptic politics in his columns, including Prime Minister Tony Blair's decision to side with George W. Bush instead of his EU partners in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Despite these differences, Young remained on good terms with senior ministers, including Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher. He wrote a critical biography of the latter, One of Us (1989), in addition to a very critical article that he wrote two weeks before his death but which was not published until after Thatcher's death, nearly ten years after his own. He wrote other books, including This Blessed Plot: Britain And Europe From Churchill To Blair, which was published in 1998. From 1989 onward, Young was the chairman of the Scott Trust, which owns The Guardian and other news media, and helped the paper through important developments such as the purchase of The Observer. His papers are held at the Guardian News & Media Archive in London. There is now an annual Hugo Young Lecture, organised by The Guardian in Young's memory. It has been delivered by David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband, Marjorie Scardino and Alex Salmond. Young married twice. His first wife, Helen Mason, died in 1989 of lung cancer. They had three daughters, including the film director Emily Young, and one son. He remarried in 1990, this time to American artist Lucy Waring. Young died at the age of 64 of colon cancer, and was buried on the west side of Highgate Cemetery.",Normal

"Calcific tendinitis is a common condition where deposits of calcium phosphate form in a tendon, sometimes causing pain at the affected site. Deposits can occur in several places in the body, but are by far most common in the rotator cuff of the shoulder. Around 80% of those with deposits experience symptoms, typically chronic pain during certain shoulder movements, or sharp acute pain that worsens at night. Calcific tendinitis is typically diagnosed by physical exam and X-ray imaging. The disease often resolves completely on its own, but is typically treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to relieve pain, rest and physical therapy to promote healing, and in some cases various procedures to breakdown andor remove the calcium deposits. Adults aged 30–50 are most commonly affected by calcific tendinitis. It is twice as common in women as men, and is not associated with exercise. Calcifications in the rotator cuff were first described by Ernest Codman in 1934. The name, ""calcifying tendinitis"" was coined by Henry Plenk in 1952. Up to 20% of those with calcific tendinitis have no symptoms. For those with symptoms, the symptoms vary based on the phase of the disease. In the initial ""formative phase"" when the calcium deposits are being formed, people rarely experience any symptoms. Those that do have symptoms tend to have intermittent shoulder pain, particularly during forward shoulder flexion (i.e. lifting the arm in front of the body). In the ""resorptive phase"" when the calcium deposit is breaking down, many experience severe acute pain that worsens at night. Those affected tend to hold the shoulder rotated inwards to alleviate pain, and have difficulty lying on the affected shoulder. Some people experience heat and redness at the affected shoulder, as well as a limited range of motion. Calcific tendinitis is caused by deposits of calcium phosphate crystals in the tendons of the shoulder. These deposits are most frequently found in the supraspinatus tendon (63% of the time), and less frequently in the infraspinatus tendon (7%), subacromial bursa (7%), subscapularis tendon (3%), or in both the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons at the same time (20%). The development of calcific tendinitis is often divided into three stages. First, in the ""precalcific stage"", something causes tendon cells to transform into other cells that can act as sites for calcium deposition. This is followed by the two-part ""calcific stage""; first calcium is deposited (the formative phase), then the body begins to break down the calcium deposit (the resorptive phase). Finally, in the ""postcalcific stage"" the calcium deposits are replaced with new tissue and the tendon completely heals. The cause of the calcium deposits remains unclear, although several theories have been put forward. Some theories involve the differentiation of tendon cells into other cells, namely cartilages or bone cells. Others associate the condition with cell death due to aging, wear, or lack of oxygen in the tissue; however, the disease is uncommon in the very old, not associated with exercise, and tends to resolve completely even if untreated. Calcific tendinitis is typically diagnosed by physical examination and X-ray imaging. During the formative phase, X-ray images typically reveal calcium deposits with uniform density and a clear margin. In the more painful resorptive phase, deposits instead appear cloudy and with unclear margins. By arthroscopy, formative stage deposits appear crystalline and chalk-like, while resorptive stage deposits appear smooth resembling toothpaste. Ultrasound is also used to locate and assess calcium deposits. In the formative stage, deposits are hyperechoic and arc-shaped; in the resorptive stage deposits are less echogenic and appear fragmented. The first line of treatment for calcific tendinitis is typically nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to relieve pain, rest for the affected joint, and sometimes physical therapy to avoid joint stiffness. For those with severe pain direct injections of steroids to the affected site are often effective for pain relief, but may interfere with reabsorption of the calcium deposit. For those whose pain doesn't improve with medication and rest, the deposit can be dissolved and removed with techniques called ""ultrasound-guided needling"", ""barbotage"", and ""US-PICT"" (for ""ultrasound percutaneous injection in calcific tenditis""). In each, ultrasound is used to locate the deposit and guide a needle to the affected site. There saline and lidocaine are injected to dissolve the deposit, then removed to wash it away. Another common treatment is extracorporeal shockwave therapy, where pulses of sound are used to break up the deposit and promote healing. There is little standardization of energy levels, duration, and time interval of treatment; though most studies report positive outcomes with low- to medium-energy waves (below 0.28 mJmm2). Surgery is only recommended once 6 months of conservative, non-operative treatment has failed to reduce symptoms. Surgery is arthroscopic and involves calcification removal with or without acromioplasty of the shoulder. Additionally, debate remains over whether a complete removal of the deposits is necessary, or if equal pain relief can be obtained from a partial removal of calcium deposits. Removing the deposits either with open shoulder surgery or arthroscopic surgery are both difficult operations, but with high success rates (around 90%). About 10% require re-operation. If the deposit is large, then frequently the patient will require a rotator cuff repair to fix the defect left in the tendon when the deposit is removed or to reattach the tendon to the bone if the deposit was at the tendon insertion into the bone. Nearly all people with calcific tendinitis recover completely with time or treatment. Treatment helps alleviate pain, but long-term follow-up studies have shown that people recover with or without treatment. Calcific tendinitis typically occurs in adults aged 30 to 50, and is rare in those older than 70. It is twice as common in women as men. Risk factors that increase the chance of developing calcific tendinitis include; hormonal disorders, like diabetes and hypothyroidism, autoimmune disorders, like rheumatoid arthritis, and metabolic disorders that also cause kidney stones, gallstones, and gout. Occupations that consist of repetitive overhead lifting, such as athletes or construction workers, do not seem to significantly increase the likelihood of developing calcific tendinitis. Calcifications in the rotator cuff tendon were first described by Ernest Codman in his 1934 book The Shoulder. In 1952, in his study on x-ray therapy for people with such calcifications, Henry Plenk coined the term ""calcifying tendinitis"".",Normal

"Turun Palloseura, commonly known as TPS, is a professional football club based in Turku, Finland. During the 2022 season, the men's first team of the club competes in Ykkönen, the second highest tier of men's football, and the women's representative team in the Kansallinen Liiga, the highest level of women's football in Finland. Nicknamed ""Tepsi"", the club was founded in 1922. TPS have won 8 League titles and 3 Finnish Cups. They play their home league matches at Veritas Stadion, with a capacity of 9,372 seats for most matches. In the early stages of the UEFA Cup of the season 1987–88, TPS beat Internazionale at the San Siro stadium in Milan, thanks to a goal by Mika Aaltonen, who was later signed by Inter. They lost the return leg with 0–2, but this is widely regarded as the highest point by the club in international football. After season 2000, TPS lost its place in Finland's Premier League and played for two seasons in the Ykkönen (eng first) in the Finnish first division. They aimed to get back up to the Premier League with determination and it took them two seasons to complete the mission. Since season 2003 TPS has again played in the Finland's Premier League, Veikkausliiga. TPS managed to get in the final of the Finnish Cup in 2005, but lost to Haka 4–1 at Finnair Stadium. Before season 2007, TPS hired famous Finnish striker Mixu Paatelainen as their manager. In his guidance TPS won bronze, ending their ten year medalless run. After the end of season Paatelainen left for Scottish club Hibernian FC in early January 2008. Quickly TPS hired heralded Finnish manager Martti Kuusela. However Kuusela didn't get the best out of his squad and was fired mid September 2008. Overall TPS ended sixth in Veikkausliiga. So again, TPS had to get a new manager, their third in as many seasons. This time they picked Pasi Rautiainen. In recent years, TPS has had the highest average attendance in Veikkausliiga but it has suffered from a poor rental agreement with Veritas Stadion. This has led TPS for planning to build their own stadium in Nummi. They also considered the possibility of using the Paavo Nurmi Stadion as their home ground, but these plans faced scheduling problems with Athletics competitions and were scrapped. Both Turku based teams however played few games at the Paavo Nurmi Stadion during 2014 season when the Veritas Stadion was under maintenance. After relegation TPS changed their home venue to the Urheilupuiston yläkenttä, which is close to the Paavo Nurmi Stadion in the Turku Sports Park, but is not eligible to be used in the Veikkausliiga. Future plans for home ground development have not been made public. TPS returned to the Veikkausliiga for the 2018 season, winning the Ykkönen title on 21 October 2017 with a 1–1 draw against Honka. However, after the 2018 season, TPS was again relegated to Ykkönen, after finishing second-to-last in the league and losing the two-leg play-off against Kokkolan Pallo-Veikot (KPV), the Ykkönen runner-up. Since the 2018 season, TPS plays all home games at Veritas Stadion.  Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.

"William de Brailes (active c. 1230 – c. 1260) was an English Early Gothic manuscript illuminator, presumably born in Brailes, Warwickshire. He signed two manuscripts, and apparently worked in Oxford, where he is documented from 1238 to 1252, owning property in Catte Street near the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, roughly on the site now occupied by the chapel of All Souls College, where various members of the book trade lived. He was married, to Celena, but evidently also held minor orders, as at least three self-portraits show him with a clerical tonsure. This was not unusual: by this date, and with the exception of the St. Albans monk Matthew Paris, the only other English illuminator of the period about whom we have significant personal information, most English illumination seems to have been done in commercial workshops run by laymen. William de Brailes illuminated Bibles, psalters, a Book of hours and secular texts, and may also have been a scribe. He is associated with a distinctive style, but other artists also worked in this manner, and distinguishing his hand from theirs is difficult. The style is characterised by energetic gesticulating figures, though with a limited range of facial expression, and a concern for narrative. Ornamental bars stretch out from historiated initials to the top or sides of the text, a feature in transition from the Romanesque style to the mature Gothic style, where decorative borders run round the whole page. Larger miniatures often contain different scenes in separate roundels. Most of his manuscripts have a page size similar to that of a standard modern paperback, and reflect the trend towards the personal ownership of books by well off but not extravagant members of both clergy and laity. The principal works attributed to Brailes and his workshop include:",Normal
"Berlino, an anthropomorphic bear, was the mascot of the 2009 World Championships in Athletics and 2018 European Athletics Championships held in Berlin, Germany, noted for his hyperactivity and celebrations with various athletes during the Championships. Up until now, Berlino appears to be mute. However, this condition does not seem to prevent him from giving interviews to the media. Berlino has been referred to as the ""star"" of the 2009 Championships and been noted by athletes, such as Usain Bolt by wearing a T-shirt with ""ICH BIN EIN BERLINO"" (""I am a Berlino"", referring to John F. Kennedy's famous West Berlin speech) written on it during warm up for the 200 meter final. The iconic image of the games is the famous photograph of Berlino and Usain Bolt down on one knee, twinned in mutual respect, sharing a mimed lightning-bolt pose to celebrate victory and a new world record. In an interview, published after the World Championships in Berlin, Usain Bolt said: ""Berlino and I have become friends. We exchanged telephone numbers."" While celebrating winning the gold in 400meter hurdles, Melaine Walker took a piggy-back off Berlino, who promptly ran into a stack of hurdles. The diverse videos of this have been watched over 400,000 times (26.08.2009) and have been called ""a YouTube classic."" He was also involved in some controversy during the men's 10,000m final in which he ran part of the race down the back straight with the athletes cheering them on. This annoyed some traditionalists and it was rumoured that the IAAF told him to reel in the enthusiasm after this act. Smaller versions of Berlino - Berlino teddies as well as Berlino key rings, both produced in China - were offered via Internet and in Berlin Tourist shops during the 2009 World Championships in Athletics in August 2009. After being delivered in the beginning of August 2009, the Berlino teddies at first sold slow. Due to the increasing popularity of the mascot during the games, Berlino soon became a bestseller and - before the end of the games - was out of stock. Berlino later made a guest appearance at the UKA Aviva British Grand Prix, in Gateshead, on 31 August 2009, alongside the British mascot, Spike. Tournament officials refused to publicly disclose who played the part of Berlino. However, the Guardian Observer reported that it was 33-year-old Berlin actor Oliver Seiffert. In 2018 Berlino reappeared as the official mascot at the Berlin Olympic Stadium for the 24th European Athletics Championships being hosted in the city.",Normal

The Hudson Yards development relies on much of both functioning and non-functioning rail systems as it also utilizes the Highline as an attraction. Construction of the entire development uses similar techniques to the Brooklyn Bridge, with the use of caissons, then the platform was created with enough strength to hold 14 acres of landscape and buildings. The lobby's walls are constructed with 26-foot silicone bronze created by the same art foundry that worked with artists like Yoko Ono and Jeff Koons. All of the apartments feature wall-to-ceiling windows, which give the building a modern look from the outside. In addition, the building is Fitwell Certified.

"The Central Arnhem Road, also referred to as the Central Arnhem Highway or locally as ""The Track"", is a designated state route in the Northern Territory of Australia linking the Stuart Highway to the town of Nhulunbuy on the Gove Peninsula and communities across the East Arnhem region. It connects over 12,000 residents and is a key tourism drive and freight route for the mining and pastoral industries. The route traverses through Aboriginal Land and passes through the Aboriginal communities of Barunga, Beswick and Bulman. A free permit from the Northern Land Council is required for non-indigenous persons to travel its length. Australian 4WD Action ranked the drive 5th in its list of 20 ""must drive"" four-wheel drive tracks in Australia in 2010. The vast majority of the road is unsealed and is prone to seasonal (December to April) flooding, resulting in frequent road restrictions for heavy vehicles and infrequent closures. Due to road conditions, four-wheel drive vehicles are recommended and caravans and camping trailers should be heavy duty. The condition of the road is highly variable, with conditions dependent on the time of year and the road maintenance schedule. Mud, river crossings, loose gravel, corrugations and bulldust are some of the road conditions subject to change of weather conditions. Fuel is available at three locations along the route: the community of Beswick, 60km (37mi) from the junction with the Stuart Highway; the Mainoru Store, 197km (122mi) from the junction with the Stuart Highway; and the community of Bulman, 256km (159mi) from the junction with the Stuart Highway. Carrying extra fuel is recommended.  Telstra service is available when passing through the Aboriginal communities of Barunga, Beswick and Bulman and at locations marked with blue signposts along the route. In 2014, a regional roads funding package was announced by the Australian Government which included $7.7 million for upgrades to the Donydji, Goyder and Mainoru River crossings, as well as allocation from the $90 million Northern Territory Roads Productivity Package for the construction of a bridge over Rocky Bottom Creek. Under the National Partnership Agreement on Land Transport (NPALT), the Australian Government has committed $180 million and the Northern Territory Government has committed $50 million to contribute to sealing, reconstructing, widening, and flood immunity improvements to priority sections of the route to a fit-for-purpose standard. These works are expected to see 25-35% of the road sealed to a dual lane standard and are expected to occur over the next five to ten years from 2019. The Federal Budget 2022-2023 released on 25 October 2022 has committed $350 million of additional funding to continue the work of sealing the Tanami Road and Central Arnhem Road. Nhulunbuy remains the only large regional centre in the Northern Territory not connected to the National Highway network via a sealed road. The Northern Territory Government is currently planning to seal the entire length of the Central Arnhem Road to a dual-lane standard which is expected to unlock the economic potential of the region and open up a range of new long term economic and social opportunities. This will be achieved through reduced transit times, improved reliability of supply chains, safer road conditions, and overall improved accessibility in the region. It is also expected to enhance liveability and improve social outcomes by improving access to health and educational services, facilitating social and cultural connections and reducing barriers to development, including operating costs for business.

"The 236th Rifle Division was formed as an infantry division of the Red Army after a motorized division of that same number was reorganized in the first weeks of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. It was based on the shtat (table of organization and equipment) of July 29, 1941, although it was briefly redesignated as a mountain rifle division prior to making an amphibious landing at Feodosia in late December. This overly ambitious undertaking by Crimean Front's 44th Army led to a disaster when a German counterattack retook the port, destroying much of the division's personnel and equipment. The remnants of the division were forced to evacuate the Crimea in the wake of the German counteroffensive in May. As it gradually rebuilt in the western Caucasus region the 236th played an important role in the defense of Tuapse during Army Group A's summer offensive. Over the winter it pursued the German 17th Army as it withdrew to the Kuban and took part in the liberation of Krasnodar. It was then moved north to join 46th Army in Southwestern Front (later 3rd Ukrainian Front) and advanced through eastern Ukraine, forcing a crossing of the Dniepr River and helping to liberate Dnepropetrovsk, for which it received a battle honor. Soon after, it was awarded two decorations for its successes in the winter battles in the great bend of the Dniepr. Its combat path was halted for a few months along the Dniestr River, but in August 1944 it began its advance through Bessarabia and into the Balkans, where all three of its rifle regiments received honors for the liberation of Belgrade. After crossing the Danube the 236th took part in the battles outside Budapest, the Hungarian capital, in early 1945, and then advanced toward Vienna, ending the war in Austria as part of 26th Army's 135th Rifle Corps. It continued to serve in the Balkans after the German surrender, but was disbanded in the fall. The division began forming in April 1941 as part of the prewar buildup of Soviet mechanized forces, at Qazax in the Transcaucasian Military District as part of the 28th Mechanized Corps. Its main order of battle was intended to be as follows: Maj. Gen. Vasilii Konstantinovich Moroz was appointed to command on April 20. This cavalry officer came to the division after 10 months as a senior instructor at the Frunze Military Academy. While there was a large number of tanks (mostly T-26s) in the Transcaucasus, there is no evidence that the 236th ever had a tank regiment and was therefore never more than a partially-formed rifle division. At the start of the German invasion the division was located at Ashtarak. In a STAVKA order dated July 26, effective August 1, the 28th Corps was to form the basis of the new 47th Army in preparation for the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran and the 236th was officially redesignated as a rifle division. While the former Corps' two tank divisions took part in this operation, the 236th was still too raw and disorganized to play any active role. After the division reorganized its order of battle was substantially changed, and there were further changes during the course of its existence: General Moroz remained in command. At the beginning of September the division's 180th Rifle Regiment was in 45th Army, while the balance remained in 47th Army, both of which were in the redesignated Transcaucasian Front; one month later the entire division had been assigned to the 45th. In December the 236th was again reassigned, now to the 9th Rifle Corps of 44th Army in Caucasus Front, and was officially redesignated as a mountain rifle division. However, in a report on December 20 its manpower and equipment was not that of a mountain division, especially in terms of specialized equipment: At about the same time it was reported that the personnel of the division were of roughly 40 percent Russian nationality, 20 percent Belarusian and Ukrainian, and 40 percent non-Slavic nationalities. Caucasus Front (soon renamed Crimean Front) began its operations to retake the Kerch Peninsula overnight on December 2526 with landings in the vicinity of Kerch itself. This was followed on December 2829 with further landings at the port city of Feodosia which took the defending German XXXXII Army Corps utterly by surprise. The assault was led by naval infantry detachments plus the 633rd Rifle Regiment of the 157th Rifle Division and by 0730 hours the German forces had completely lost control of the port. By the end of the day elements of three Red Army divisions were ashore, including part of the 236th. The response of the German Corps commander, Lt. Gen. H. von Sponeck, was one of near panic as the communications of his own 46th Infantry Division were in immediate danger of being cut off from the rest of the Crimea. He disobeyed orders from the headquarters of 11th Army and directed the 46th to retreat from the Kerch area despite the fact that nearly 20,000 Romanian troops were on hand to counterattack Feodosia. Sponeck ordered two Romanian brigades to counterattack the Soviet lodgement on December 30 but these troops, tired from countermarching and without artillery or air support, were quickly repulsed. 9th Corps now pushed northward to complete the isolation of XXXXII Corps. Over two days the 46th Infantry marched 120km (75mi) westward in a snowstorm; fuel shortages led to some motor vehicles being abandoned and heavy weapons lagged behind. When its lead elements reached the crossroads town of Vladislavovka they were shocked to find it held in strength by the 63rd Mountain Rifle Division. The German divisional commander ordered his lead regiments to crash through the position but this failed due to exhaustion and lack of artillery. Inexplicably the 9th Corps had left a 9km-wide (5.6mi) gap between its pincer and the south shore of the Sea of Azov through which the German division was able to escape with light losses in personnel. By January 1, 1942, the XXXXII Corps had established a new line roughly 16km (9.9mi) west of Feodosia. The Romanian 4th Mountain Brigade was in a strong position at Staryi Krym but the 236th was pushing against its lines. An attack that day on the XXXXII Corps command post at Ismail-Terek by infantry and T-26 tanks of 44th Army failed with the loss of 16 vehicles knocked out. Despite this setback the army appeared to be in a good position with 23,000 troops ashore and the Axis forces appearing weak and disorganized. The 236th was holding about 13km (8.1mi) west of Feodosia on the Biyuk-Eget ridge, the best defensive terrain in the area, with a forward security zone 5km (3.1mi) farther west, while the 63rd Mountain remained on the defense in and around Vladislavovka as 51st Army moved up from the Kerch area. In fact the 44th Army was overextended and the Crimean Front was hampered by the inept leadership of Lt. Gen. D. T. Kozlov. By January 13 the commander of 11th Army, Gen. d. Inf. E. von Manstein, had concentrated more than four divisions outside Feodosia. Manstein's counteroffensive began at dawn on January 15, focused on the 236th; Kozlov was convinced the German objective would be Vladislavovka and had therefore concentrated most of his reserves to this sector. A brief artillery preparation fell on the forward zone, followed by Ju 87s and He 111s bombing the ridge line. This was immediately followed by a German infantry assault, led by the 213th Regiment of 73rd Infantry Division along with two battalions of the 46th Division, which apparently took the forward defense by surprise and overran it. Three StuG IIIs supported the attack and knocked out two T-26s, but one of the assault guns was then knocked out by a 76mm cannon. The commander of 44th Army, Maj. Gen. A. N. Pervushin, was badly wounded in an air attack, which disrupted command and control. By evening the 213th Regiment had taken the Biyuk-Eget ridge, completing the defeat of the 236th. The next day the German attack steadily pushed 63rd Mountain back toward the sea and threatened to isolate the 236th in Feodosia. The 132nd Infantry Division was brought up on January 17 and attacked directly into the northern part of the port, ripping apart the remaining defenses. After taking Sarygol the 236th was effectively isolated. The Black Sea Fleet braved air attack to attempt an emergency evacuation but few troops managed to escape in this manner. Others managed to filter through German lines to the east, eventually reaching the Parpach Narrows, but by the end of the next day 5,300 men had been taken prisoner in Feodosia, mostly from the division, roughly half its strength. Among those who escaped was General Moroz and most of his command cadre. On February 6 he was relieved of his command and arrested ""for the loss of control of the division"". He was court-martialed and condemned to death on February 18 with the sentence being carried out four days later. He had been replaced by Col. Pyotr Ivanovich Nemertsalov. As of February 1 the 236th had lost its designation as a mountain division. Later in the month its remnants were transferred to 47th Army, still in Crimean Front, which was positioned near Kerch as a second echelon holding command for some time. Beginning on February 27 General Kozlov launched a number of offensives from his positions at the Parpach, but these did little to restore his situation while also causing heavy casualties to his forces. Before the last of these offensives ended General von Manstein began planning an operation to destroy all three armies of Crimean Front in one stroke. Operation Trappenjagd would initially target the 44th Army, which was defending a sector about 6km (3.7mi) long with five rifle divisions and two tank brigades. When the operation began on May 8 the division was still in 47th Army and so largely escaped the disaster that overwhelmed 44th and 51st Armies. The still-depleted 236th managed to evacuate most of its personnel and some equipment across Kerch Strait to the Taman Peninsula. By June 1 it was in North Caucasus Front, again in 44th Army. On May 30 Colonel Nemertsalov was replaced by Col. Gleb Nikolaevich Korchikov, who concurrently commanded the 396th Rifle Division for the next two weeks. When 1st Panzer and 17th Armies began their part of the German summer offensive on July 7 the 236th was part of 1st Rifle Corps, which was under direct command of the Front. By the time these German forces reached the line of the lower Don River around July 25 the division (still described as ""remnants"") was part of 18th Army of Southern Front along with the 383rd, 395th, and 216th Rifle Divisions, 68th Naval Rifle Brigade and remnants of 16th Rifle Brigade, defending a 50km (31mi) sector from the Kagalnik at the mouth of the Don eastward to Kiziterinka, 20km (12mi) southeast of Rostov. By August 1 the division and its Army had again come under the command of the North Caucasian Front. On August 10 the STAVKA signaled the Front commander, Marshal S. M. Budyonny, in part: With the arrival of the enemy in the Tuapse region, 47th Army and all of the front's forces located in the Krasnodar region could be cut off and end up as prisoners... Immediately push 32nd Guards Rifle Division forward and, with it, together with 236th Rifle Division, occupy three-four lines in depth from Maykop to Tuapse, and, at all costs, you are personally responsible for letting the enemy through to Tuapse. The Front's staff replied with a detailed plan of defense on August 13. On September 1 Colonel Korchikov was relieved of his command for his conduct of the retreat and was replaced the next day by Maj. Gen. Nikita Emelianovich Chuvakov. The former officer would return to the fighting as deputy commander of the 353rd Rifle Division and later as commander of the 48th Guards Rifle Division and be promoted to the rank of major general in March 1944. The latter had been serving as deputy commander of 12th Army but refused to fully comply with the terms of Order No. 227, leading to his arrest and sentence of 2 years imprisonment, suspended until after the war. The sentence was annulled in February 1943. At the start of September the division was still in 18th Army, and remained on the defense on the approaches to Tuapse. 17th Army, which had already attempted to reach the city during the previous weeks, began Operation Attika on September 23 with a total of seven divisions of the LVII Panzer, XXXXIX Mountain, and XXXXIV Army Corps, although the latter two Corps did not kick off until two days later. The objective was to capture Tuapse and encircle the bulk of 18th Army northeast of Shaumyan, where the 236th was currently positioned. While the distance to be covered was a modest 50km (31mi), it would require negotiating winding mountain roads against stiff resistance in deteriorating weather conditions. By this time North Caucasian Front had been split and 18th Army was part of the Black Sea Group of Forces. The group consisted of four armies deployed along the Black Sea coast and the crest of the western Caucasus Mountains, with 18th Army on the right wing from Staroobriadcheskii to Mount Matazyk. The 236th was one of five rifle divisions in the first echelon. The defense had been augmented by the creation of the Tuapse Defensive Region under the Black Sea Fleet. However the limited road network prevented adequate supply of the forward forces. The 97th and 101st Jäger Divisions of XXXXIV Corps began their parts in the offensive by attacking the 32nd Guards on September 25 along the Shaumyan road. This continued for three days as the Guardsmen limited the advance to only a few kilometres. The German divisions now turned to the south and assaulted the 236th and 383rd Divisions on Mount Lysaya, which fell after heavy fighting. In an effort to complete the breakthrough the assault on the 383rd's right wing was reinforced. Since this division was defending along a 25km-wide (16mi) sector it was forced to withdraw westward on September 30. This in turn collapsed the defenses on the right flank of the 236th and it was obliged to conform. By October 5 the mountain troops of Group Lanz had captured Mounts Gunai and Geiman, reached the valley of the Gunaika River, and was 15–20km (9.3–12.4mi) deep into 18th Army's defenses. On October 7, under pressure from STAVKA, the 18th Army commander, Lt. Gen. F. V. Kamkov, initiated a counterattack against Group Lanz's forward positions in the valley with the 236th, the 12th Guards Cavalry Division, 40th Motorized and 119th Rifle Brigades. This effort was hastily organized and failed to dent the German defenses. A better-planned series of counterattacks brought the German group to a halt on October 9, barely short of the Khadyzhensk–Tuapse road. 17th Army now paused for rest and reorganization until October 13. The 17th resumed its offensive on the 14th, still attempting to reach Tuapse and encircle 18th Army. As a result of its initial successes General Kamkov was replaced by Maj. Gen. A. A. Grechko on October 18. This officer's more effective leadership, in addition to attrition of the German forces and the arrival of Soviet reinforcements, brought the offensive to a standstill by early November. By this time the 236th was providing most of the manpower for the Tuapse Defensive Region, along with the devastated 408th Rifle Division and the 408th Rifle Brigade. As of December 1 the division was still the main formation of the Tuapse Defensive Region, especially after the disbanding of the 408th Division on November 25. As the position of the German armies in southern Russia deteriorated, especially with the encirclement of 6th Army at Stalingrad, it became clear that Army Group A would soon be forced to retreat from the Caucasus to avoid encirclement. By the beginning of the new year all Red Army forces in the region were under Transcaucasian Front, although still split between a Northern Group and a Black Sea Group, and as of January 1 the 236th was under direct command of the Front. On January 11 the STAVKA approved plans for Operations ""Mountain"" and ""Sea"" to encircle and destroy the German armies as they pulled back toward Rostov and the Kuban. The division had returned to 18th Army and was part of 16th Rifle Corps, along with the 10th and 107th Rifle Brigades, and according to the plan was to advance eastward along the Shaumyan and Khadyzhensk axis at the start of the offensive. The army began its advance on January 14, reacting to what was believed to be a withdrawal by the German forces opposite. 16th Corps was to attack along the Tuapse road against the defenses of the 101st Jäger and elements of 4th Mountain Division, reach the withdrawal route of the German main grouping and destroy it in cooperation with 353rd Division and 40th Motorized Brigade. The Corps was in the center of the army's formation and because it faced the strongest German sector was allocated most of the army's artillery in support. When the attack began at dawn it encountered very strong resistance and harsh winter weather, with heavy rains and snow up to a metre deep, and made only modest progress of 2–8km (1.2–5.0mi), capturing Kotlovina and reaching the Mount Gunai and Geiman line. The next day the Corps reached the southern outskirts of Shaumyan, which was liberated on January 16, and the 236th took Navaginskii. Although none of the initial objectives had been met, the offensive did force 17th Army to accelerate its withdrawal. On January 26 the 18th Army was directed to attack to capture Khadyzhenskaya by the end of the next day and reach the Saratovskaya region by January 30. It was then to force the Kuban River at Pashkovskaya and destroy the German Krasnodar grouping in cooperation with 56th Army. The 236th and 353rd Divisions were to attack from second echelon toward Lineinaya, Suzdalskaya, and Shabanokhabl. Due to the transportation difficulties the army was told to rely on local resources for food. 17th Army began its planned withdrawal from defensive line ""F"" to the line of the Kuban on January 28. On the same day the division reached the village of Abkhazskaya and pushed north from there the next day against rearguards from the 46th Infantry Division. Anticipating that the 17th Army was about to evade encirclement the Black Sea Group's forces were ordered to accelerate their pursuit, and on January 30 the division captured Kochkin, 7km (4.3mi) east of Zarya Vostok. The next day the 236th, in a joint advance with the 68th Rifle Brigade, reached the Vochepshiy region, 30km (19mi) southeast of Krasnodar. As this stage of the campaign ended on February 1 the division, which had been the strongest in 18th Army on January 10, with 6,933 personnel, had been reduced to 4,636 or 49 percent of authorized strength. On February 4 the commander of the Black Sea Group, Lt. Gen. I. Ye. Petrov, issued orders to his 18th, 46th and 56th Armies to prepare for a converging attack on Krasnodar for the east and the south. Despite continued difficulties due to rainy weather the attack began on February 9. Maj. Gen. A. I. Ryzhov, the 18th Army's commander, almost immediately noticed that XXXXIX Mountain Corps had pulled back from the Kuban River and sent infantry to gain a crossing and then had his engineers construct a pontoon bridge. Once this was completed he sent the 40th Motorized Brigade and sent it across. On the morning of the next day German rearguards of the 198th Infantry crossed the river into Krasnodar and blew up the last bridges. On February 11 the 236th put two rifle regiments across, including the 509th, which reached the southern outskirts of the city by 2000 hours and captured the railway station by 2300. Krasnodar was fully liberated the next day. By the start of March the division had been transferred to 46th Army. On March 4 General Chuvakov left the division to take command of the 23rd Rifle Corps. He would hold other corps commands into the postwar era, be made a Hero of the Soviet Union on October 25, and would be promoted to the rank of major general in April 1945. The new commander of the division was Maj. Gen. Nikita Fyodorovich Tsepliaev, who had been leading the 40th Motorized Brigade. Under STAVKA Order No. 46082 of March 20 was one of a group of divisions that were to be moved by rail to Millerovo in preparation for transfer to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for redeployment to the Kursk region. By the start of May the division was in 46th Army in the Steppe Military District. At the end of the month General Tsepliaev left the division to take command of the Military Horse Breeding Directorate and was replaced by Hero of the Soviet Union Col. Ivan Ivanovich Fesin. Fesin had won the honor while commanding the 13th Motorized Rifle Brigade in battles near Rossosh and Kharkiv in January and February for continuing to lead despite being wounded in the left leg and later the left hand. He came to the 236th after his release from hospital. As of June 1 the division was still in 46th Army, now as part of Southwestern Front, where it remained into July. Before the division could take part in the second Donbas Strategic Offensive it returned to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command with its Army and moved north. After a lengthy redeployment it reached the right (north) flank of Southwestern Front and went into action on August 25 after crossing the Siverskyi Donets River south of Kharkiv. That city had changed hands for the final time on August 21 and the 236th was exploiting the breakthrough of the German front in the direction of Dniprodzerzhynsk. On September 25-26 elements of the division were the first in the army to reach the Dniepr, and overnight successfully forced a crossing near the village of Soshinovka near Dnepropetrovsk. Under Colonel Fesin's leadership the bridgehead was entrenched and held for three days under heavy counterattacks until the remainder of the army could come up. In recognition, on November 1 he would be awarded a rare second Gold Star, and would be promoted to the rank of major general on November 17. Some 20 other soldiers of the division, including the commander of the 509th Regiment, Lt. Col. Ivan Mikhailovich Orlov, were also made Heroes for this action. 46th Army had been reassigned to Steppe Front on September 10, but early in October it returned to Southwestern Front (3rd Ukrainian Front from October 20). Later that month the division had been assigned to 26th Guards Rifle Corps. On October 25 it took part in the liberation of Dnepropetrovsk and was awarded a battle honor: DNEPROPETROVSK - ...236th Rifle Division (Colonel Fesin, Ivan Ivanovich)... The troops who participated in the liberation of Dnepropetrovsk and Dneprodzerzhinsk, by the order of the Supreme High Command of 25 October 1943, and a commendation in Moscow, are given a salute of 20 artillery salvoes from 224 guns. At the same time that this Dnipropetrovsk Operation was being carried out, elements of 2nd Ukrainian Front, after crossing the Dniepr farther upstream, reached Piatykhatky before driving on to Kryvyi Rih, which was liberated but then lost under the weight of counterattacks by 1st Panzer Army. By the start of the new year the 236th had been transferred to 34th Rifle Corps, still in 46th Army. On January 10, 1944, 3rd Ukrainian Front launched an attack in part with 46th Army west of the Bazavluk River against the rebuilt German 6th Army holding out in the great bend of the Dniepr, but this miscarried when the Soviet infantry failed to keep up with the tanks. Further efforts over the next three days forced the front line back about 8km (5.0mi) at considerable cost. The offensive was renewed on January 30 after a powerful artillery preparation against the positions of the German XXX Army Corps on the same sector, but this was met with a counter-barrage that disrupted the attack. A new effort the next day, backed by even heavier artillery and air support, made progress but still did not penetrate the German line. When February began the division was under command of 6th Guards Rifle Corps. On that day the XXX Corps line was pierced in several places and by nightfall the Soviet forces had torn a 9km-wide (5.6mi) gap in the line west of the Bazavluk. During the next two days 6th Army tried to avoid encirclement by slogging through the mud to the Kamenka River line, which was already compromised by the Soviet advance. Forward detachments of 8th Guards Army reached Apostolove on the 4th and over the next few days 46th Army began to attempt a sweep westward to envelop Kryvyi Rih from the south. The dispersion of the Front's forces, combined with German reserves produced by the evacuation of the Nikopol bridgehead east of the Dniepr and indecision on the part of the German high command, produced ""a peculiar sort of semiparalysis"" on this part of the front during the second half of the month. Finally, on February 21 elements of the 46th and 37th Armies broke into the outer defenses of Kryvyi Rih. To avoid costly street fighting 6th Army was withdrawn west of the city, which was cleared the next day. On February 13 the 236th was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its part in the battles for the lower Dniepr, Nikopol and Apostolove, and on the 26th it was further decorated with the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Degree, for its role in the second liberation of Kryvyi Rih. As of March 1, the division had returned to 34th Corps and a month later was advancing under this command with the 394th Rifle Division. The 46th was one of three armies on the right flank 3rd Ukrainian Front that were tasked with continuing the offensive towards the Dniestr River while also protecting the Front's right flank. On April 8 the army was ordered to advance to the river as rapidly as possible. 34th Corps, on the army's left (south) flank, was to reach the river in the sector east of Răscăieți, 30km (19mi) south of Tiraspol, capture the towns of Korotnoe and Nezaertailovka near the river's east bank, force a crossing, and prepare to advance to the west. Forward detachments of the Corps reached the Dniestr late on April 11. The two divisions managed to capture small and precarious footholds on the narrow strip of flatlands west of the river but could advance no farther. In mid-April the army was ordered to attack the two German strongpoints of Cioburciu and Răscăieți. The assault on the former collapsed almost immediately but the attack by 34th Corps, which was soon reinforced by the 353rd Rifle Division, in three days of heavy fighting advanced 2–5km (1.2–3.1mi) deep in an 8km-wide (5.0mi) sector south of Răscăieți, threatening to envelop the town from the south. However, the German XXIX Army Corps reinforced the defenses at Cioburciu, allowing the 76th Infantry Division to shift most of its forces to its left wing and halt the Soviet advance. 46th Army played little subsequent role in the first offensive. On June 13 General Fesin was admitted to hospital due to illness and left his command five days later, handing the division over to Hero of the Soviet Union Col. Pyotr Ivanovich Kulizhskii. Fesin would remain in hospital until August, when he became commandant of the Moscow Infantry School. He would remain in the training establishment until his retirement in 1965. Kulizhskii had won his Gold Star while leading the 152nd Rifle Division in the Dnepropetrovsk operation and would be promoted to the rank of major general on November 2; he commanded the 236th for the duration of the war. At the start of August it was still in 34th Corps of 46th Army. From May through most of August the division had remained in much the same positions while the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts prepared for a new offensive. 46th Army's front now ran from the western outskirts of Talmaza all the way to the Black Sea coast. In the last days before the assault, 34th Corps concentrated the 394th and 353rd Divisions in the bridgehead over the Dniestr at Purcari, while the 236th formed the army's reserve. The offensive opened at dawn on August 20, and during that day the stubborn strongpoint at Răscăieți was finally captured. Overall, 46th Army achieved all of its first-day objectives. On the second day the 34th Corps continued its advance as the German 6th and Romanian 3rd Armies were being split apart by the Front's spearheads. By the 23rd, 46th Army was in the process of encircling the Romanian forces while the 236th was concentrating in the Fridenstal area, still serving as the army's reserve. This encirclement completed the demoralization of the Romanian Army and led to that nation soon leaving the Axis. The 46th was now to completely clear the southern part of Bessarabia and occupy favorable positions for further operations into Romania. By the beginning of September the 236th had come under direct command of 3rd Ukrainian Front, and remained there into October. Through September the Front advanced through Romania and northern Bulgaria with the intention of pushing north and south of Arad for a thrust across the Tisza River to Budapest, but this was too ambitious after the lengthy offensive. On October 4 Soviet forces reached Pančevo on the north bank of the Danube 16km (9.9mi) downstream from Belgrade and on the 8th the railroad running into the city from the south was cut. On the night of October 14 a combined force of Soviet troops and Yugoslav partisans entered Belgrade and took the city center by the next afternoon. For this feat one of the division's regiments was awarded a battle honor: BELGRADE - ...177th Rifle Regiment (Lt. Colonel Petrin, Nikolai Kuzmich)... The troops who participated in the battles of Belgrade, by the order of the Supreme High Command of 20 October 1944, and a commendation in Moscow, are given a salute of 24 artillery salvoes from 324 guns. At this time the division was serving in the 75th Rifle Corps of 57th Army, still in 3rd Ukrainian Front. On November 14 the other two rifle regiments would also receive honors: the 814th would be awarded the Order of the Red Banner, while the 507th was given the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 2nd Degree. Later in October the 3rd Ukrainian Front crossed the Sava River and by the end of the month reached the Ruma area, 60km (37mi) northwest of Belgrade. At this time the 57th Army's forces were dispersed over a very large area with lengthy lines of communication. By the beginning of November the 236th had been shifted to the 64th Rifle Corps in the same Army. At the start of the Budapest Operation on October 29 the 64th Corps (19th, 236th and 73rd Guards Rifle Divisions) was fighting along the line from Hrtkovci to Progar, then along the right bank of the Kolubara River before reaching the Stara Pazova–Vojka–Nova Pazova area which was occupied by the 236th's main forces. The Corps had the task of leaving a covering force along these lines before concentrating by October 31 at crossing points on the Sava River at Belgrade, Grocka, Dubrovica, and Surduk. The Corps got over from October 31 to November 3 and was to concentrate in the Sambor–Miletic area by November 5 in preparation for a further crossing of the Danube. Before the forcing was to begin on November 15 the division, along with the 32nd Motorized Rifle Brigade, was moved to the 57th Army reserve and was on the march in the Žabalj area. By the 15th it had reached its assigned crossing point at Kupusina. By the end of November 18 it had two rifle regiments over the river into the bridgehead that had been established by 75th Corps. These were occupying positions near the dyke 2km (1.2mi) northwest of Kozjak and then to the south along the dyke. The third regiment was at the crossing point. After completing its crossing the division went over to the attack and by the end of November 22 had expanded the breakthrough of the German defense up to 5km (3.1mi) toward the flanks and captured the Monorosz–Csiprasat and, after overcoming the last defensive line along the second dyke, advanced 3km (1.9mi) in the direction of Mirkovac. By this time it was again officially subordinated to 75th Corps, and as of November 24 the Corps was east of Kneževi Vinogradi–east of Grabovac–northern outskirts of Lug. One division was fighting for the former place the next day while the remainder of the Corps was held up by heavy German fire resistance. Kneževi Vinogradi finally fell on November 28. On December 26 the Hungarian capital was encircled, and the Axis forces began operations to relieve the garrison on January 1, 1945. The third such operation, called Konrad III, began on January 18. On the morning of January 20 the German forces continued to attack to the east and northeast in an effort to capture Székesfehérvár. In reaction the 236th and 233rd Rifle Divisions were pulled into Front reserve in case they were needed to defend the southern sector of the new defensive front. Székesfehérvár fell on January 22. Two days later the headquarters of 133rd Rifle Corps was attached to 57th Army and the two divisions came under its command; the Corps formed the army's right flank along the Sárvíz Canal. The 236th relieved the 32nd Mechanized Brigade, which was pulled into the army reserve in the Tamasin area. As an indication of the rapidly evolving situation on the Soviet side, the next day the 135th Rifle Corps headquarters was also subordinated to the army and the two divisions shifted to its command. The 236th would remain in the Corps for the duration of the war. By the 26th the German relief force had reached to within 25km (16mi) of the inner encirclement but this proved to be the limit of the advance. On January 31, as the Front went over to the counteroffensive, a German counter-effort struck the division. Up to a regiment of infantry, supported by 80 armored vehicles and 35 tanks, was able to encircle or partly encircle most of the division's subunits, but was defeated with the loss of 15 armored vehicles, plus 700 prisoners, six guns, 30 machine guns and more than 100 motor vehicles captured. Budapest fell on February 13. During the month the 135th Corps, which now also contained the 74th Rifle Division, was moved to 26th Army, still in 3rd Ukrainian Front. The 236th remained in this Army into the postwar. After helping to defeat the 6th SS Panzer Army in Operation Spring Awakening in March, during early April the 26th Army advanced on Vienna, which was taken on April 13, and the division ended the war advancing north of Graz. At the time of the German surrender the men and women of the division shared the full title of 236th Rifle, Dnepropetrovsk, Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov Division. (Russian: 236-я стрелковая Днепропетровская Краснознамённая ордена Суворова дивизия.) On June 15 it was assigned, along with the rest of its Army, to the Southern Group of Forces, but this was short-lived as the division was disbanded in October.",Normal

"The presidency of James Buchanan began on March 4, 1857, when James Buchanan was inaugurated as 15th president of the United States, and ended on March 4, 1861. Buchanan, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, took office as the 15th United States president after defeating former President Millard Fillmore of the American Party, and John C. Frémont of the Republican Party in the 1856 presidential election. Buchanan was nominated by the Democratic Party at its 1856 convention, where he defeated both the incumbent President Franklin Pierce and Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas. Despite his long experience in government, Buchanan was unable to calm the growing sectional crisis that would divide the nation at the close of his term. Prior to taking office, Buchanan lobbied the Supreme Court to issue a broad ruling in Dred Scott v. Sandford. Though Buchanan hoped that the Court's ruling would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, Buchanan's support of the ruling deeply alienated many Northerners. Buchanan also joined with Southern leaders in attempting to gain the admission of Kansas to the Union as a slave state under the Lecompton Constitution. In the midst of the growing chasm between slave states and free states, the Panic of 1857 struck the nation, causing widespread business failures and high unemployment. Tensions over slavery continued to the end of Buchanan's term. Buchanan had promised in his inaugural address to serve just one term, and with the ongoing national turmoil over slavery and the nature of the Union, there was a deep yearning for fresh leadership within the Democratic Party. Republican nominee Abraham Lincoln, running on a platform devoted to keeping slavery out of all Western territories, defeated the splintered Democratic Party and Constitutional Union candidate John Bell to win the 1860 election. In response to Lincoln's victory, seven Southern states declared their secession from the Union. Buchanan refused to confront the seceded states with military force, but retained control of Fort Sumter. However, in its last two months the Buchanan Administration took a much stiffer anti-Confederate position, as Southerners resigned. The president announced that he would do all within his power to defend Fort Sumter, thereby rallying Northern support. Key anti-Confederate leaders included the new Attorney General Edwin Stanton and the new Secretary of War Joseph Holt. The secession crisis culminated in the outbreak of the American Civil War shortly after Buchanan left office. Historians condemn him for not forestalling the secession of southern states or addressing the issue of slavery. He is consistently ranked as one of the worst presidents in American history, often being ranked as the worst president. After Franklin Pierce won the 1852 presidential election, Buchanan agreed to serve as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Buchanan's service abroad conveniently placed him outside of the country while a debate over the Kansas–Nebraska Act roiled the nation. While Buchanan did not overtly seek the 1856 Democratic presidential nomination, he most deliberately chose not to discourage the movement on his behalf, something that was well within his power on many occasions. The 1856 Democratic National Convention met in June 1856, writing a platform that largely reflected Buchanan's views, including support for the Fugitive Slave Law, an end to anti-slavery agitation, and U.S. ""ascendancy in the Gulf of Mexico."" Buchanan led on the first ballot, boosted by the support of powerful Senators John Slidell, Jesse Bright, and James A. Bayard, who presented Buchanan as an experienced leader who could appeal to the North and South. President Pierce and Senator Stephen A. Douglas also sought the nomination, but Buchanan was selected as the Democratic presidential nominee on the seventeenth ballot of the convention. He was joined on the Democratic ticket by John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. By 1856, the Whig Party, which had long been the main opposition to the Democrats, had collapsed. Buchanan faced not just one but two candidates in the general election: former Whig President Millard Fillmore ran as the American Party (or ""Know-Nothing"") candidate, while John C. Frémont ran as the Republican nominee. Much of the private rhetoric of the campaign focused on unfounded rumors regarding Frémont—talk of him as president taking charge of a large army that would support slave insurrections, the likelihood of widespread lynchings of slaves, and whispered hope among slaves for freedom and political equality. Sticking with the convention of the times, Buchanan did not himself campaign, but he wrote letters and pledged to uphold the Democratic platform. In the election, Buchanan carried every slave state except for Maryland, as well as five free states, including his home state of Pennsylvania. He won 45 percent of the popular vote and 174 electoral votes, compared to Frémont's 114 electoral votes and Fillmore's 8 electoral votes. Buchanan's election made him the first and only president from Pennsylvania. In his victory speech, Buchanan denounced Republicans, calling the Republican Party a ""dangerous"" and ""geographical"" party that had unfairly attacked the South. President-elect Buchanan would also state, ""the object of my administration will be to destroy sectional party, North or South, and to restore harmony to the Union under a national and conservative government."" Buchanan was inaugurated as the nation's 15th president on March 4, 1857, on the East Portico of the United States Capitol. Chief Justice Roger Taney administered the Oath of office. This is the first inauguration ceremony known to have been photographed. In his inaugural address, Buchanan committed himself to serving only one term. He also spoke critically about the growing divisions over slavery and its status in the territories, stating, ""It is the imperative and indispensable duty of the government of the United States to secure to every resident inhabitant the free and independent expression of his opinion by his vote. This sacred right of each individual must be preserved. That being accomplished, nothing can be fairer than to leave the people of a territory free from all foreign interference to decide their own destiny for themselves, subject only to the Constitution of the United States."" Furthermore, Buchanan argued that a federal slave code should protect the rights of slave owners in any federal territory. He alluded to a pending Supreme Court case, Dred Scott v. Sandford, which he stated would permanently settle the issue of slavery. Buchanan already knew the outcome of the case and had even played a part in its disposition. Associate Justice Robert C. Grier leaked the decision of the ""Dred Scott"" case early to Buchanan. In his inaugural address Buchanan declared that the issue of slavery in the territories would be ""speedily and finally settled"" by the Supreme Court. According to historian Paul Finkelman: Buchanan already knew what the Court was going to decide. In a major breach of Court etiquette, Justice Grier, who, like Buchanan, was from Pennsylvania, had kept the President-elect fully informed about the progress of the case and the internal debates within the Court. When Buchanan urged the nation to support the decision, he already knew what Taney would say. Republican suspicions of impropriety turned out to be fully justified. Historians agree that the address was a major disaster for Buchanan as the Dred Scott decision dramatically inflamed tensions leading to the Civil War. In 2022 historian David W. Blight argues that the year 1857 was, ""the great pivot on the road to disunion...largely because of the Dred Scott case, which stoked the fear, distrust and conspiratorial hatred already common in both the North and the South to new levels of intensity."" As his inauguration approached, Buchanan sought to establish a harmonious cabinet that would not fall victim to the in-fighting that had plagued Andrew Jackson's top officials. One of his closest advisers—who was named ambassador to Britain—was Jehu Glancy Jones. Buchanan sought to be the clear leader of the cabinet, and chose men who would agree with his views. Anticipating that his administration would concentrate on foreign policy and that Buchanan himself would largely direct foreign policy, he appointed the aging Lewis Cass as Secretary of State. Cass would become marginalized in Buchanan's administration, with Buchanan and Assistant Secretary of State John Appleton instead directing foreign affairs. In filling out his cabinet, Buchanan chose four Southerners and three Northerners, one of whom was Secretary of the Navy Isaac Toucey, widely considered to be a ""doughface"", or Southern-sympathizer. Aside from the nearly-senile Cass, only Attorney General Jeremiah S. Black lacked partiality towards the South, but Black despised abolitionists and free-soilers. Buchanan's appointment of Southerners and Southern sympathizers alienated many in the North, and his failure to appoint any followers of Stephen Douglas divided the party. Though Buchanan owed his nomination to Douglas's decision to withdraw from consideration at the 1856 Democratic convention, he disliked Douglas personally. He favored Jesse D. Bright, who hoped to unseat Douglas as the leader of the Midwestern Democrats. Outside of the cabinet, Buchanan left in place many of Pierce's appointments but removed a disproportionate number of Northerners who had ties to Pierce or Douglas. Buchanan quickly alienated his vice president, Breckinridge, who played little role in the Buchanan administration. Buchanan and his allies in Congress worked systematically to undermine Douglas. By 1860 they had weakened his influence in the party; they had stripped away his patronage and removed him from the powerful chairmanship of the Committee on Territories. He was much weaker inside the Senate than before. Nevertheless, Douglas had a powerful base outside Washington in the northern wing of the Democratic Party that was increasingly hostile to the president and his southern supporters. The battle with Lincoln in 1858 drew national attention, with Democrats reading Douglas's debates and hailing him as the victor, allowing Douglas to emerge as the favorite to win the party nomination for president in 1860. Buchanan appointed one Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States, Nathan Clifford of Maine. Clifford had served with Buchanan in James K. Polk's cabinet, and his views on major issues largely aligned with those of Buchanan. Clifford succeeded Benjamin Robbins Curtis, who had resigned in protest of the Dred Scott decision. Clifford's nomination was opposed by many Northern senators, but he won confirmation in a 26-to-23 vote. A second vacancy arose after the death of Peter Vivian Daniel in 1860, and Buchanan nominated Attorney General Black to fill the opening. In the aftermath of the election of 1860, Black fell just one vote short of confirmation, leaving one Supreme Court seat open as Buchanan left office. Aside from Clifford, Buchanan appointed only seven other Article III federal judges, all to United States district courts. In the aftermath of the Mexican–American War, a new debate had arisen over the status of slavery in the western territories. While abolitionism had not emerged as a strong force, many Northerners saw slavery as a moral blight and opposed the extension of slavery into the territories. Many Southerners, meanwhile, were deeply offended by the moral assault on the institution of slavery and feared that an attack on slavery in the territories could lead to an attack on slavery in the South. The Compromise of 1850 had temporarily defused the situation, but every Northern defiance of the Fugitive Slave Act (passed as part of the compromise) inflamed tensions in the South. The 1852 publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin further divided opinion. In 1854, the Kansas–Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri Compromise, which had excluded slavery from territories north of the 36°30′ parallel. Each new state would instead decide upon the status of slavery under the concept of popular sovereignty. The bill was very unpopular in the North, and its passage contributed to the collapse of the Whig Party and the rise of the Republican Party, which consisted almost entirely of Northerners opposed to the expansion of slavery into the territories. Though few Republicans sought to abolish slavery in the South, Southerners saw the very existence of the Republican Party as an affront, and the Republicans made little effort to appeal to the South with any of their other policies, such as support for high tariffs and federally-funded internal improvements. Upon taking office, Buchanan hoped to not only end the tensions over slavery but also vanquish what he saw as a dangerously sectional Republican Party. The most pressing issue regarding slavery was its status in the territories, and whether popular sovereignty meant that territorial legislatures could bar the entrance of slaves. Seeing an opening in a pending Supreme Court case to settle the issue, President-Elect Buchanan had involved himself in the decision-making process of the Court in the months leading up to his own inauguration. Two days after Buchanan's inauguration, Chief Justice Taney delivered the Dred Scott decision, which asserted that Congress had no constitutional power to exclude slavery in the territories. Prior to his inauguration, Buchanan had written to Justice John Catron in January 1857, inquiring about the outcome of the case and suggesting that a broader decision would be more prudent. Catron, who was from Tennessee, replied on February 10 that the Supreme Court's Southern majority would decide against Scott, but would likely have to publish the decision on narrow grounds if there was no support from the Court's northern justices—unless Buchanan could convince his fellow Pennsylvanian, Justice Robert Cooper Grier, to join the majority. Buchanan hoped that a broad Supreme Court decision protecting slavery in the territories could lay the issue to rest once and for all, allowing the country to focus on other issues, including the possible annexation of Cuba and the acquisition of more Mexican territory. So Buchanan wrote to Grier and successfully prevailed upon him, allowing the majority leverage to issue a broad-ranging decision that transcended the specific circumstances of Scott's case to declare the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional. When the Court's decision in Dred Scott was issued two days after Buchanan's inauguration, Republicans began spreading word that Taney had revealed to Buchanan the forthcoming result. Buchanan's strong public support of the decision earned him and his party the enmity of many Northerners from the outset of his presidency. The Panic of 1857 began in the middle of that year, ushered in by the sequential collapse of fourteen hundred state banks and five thousand businesses. While the South escaped largely unscathed, Northern cities saw numerous unemployed men and women take to the streets to beg. Reflecting his Jacksonian background, Buchanan's response was ""reform not relief"". While the government was ""without the power to extend relief"", it would continue to pay its debts in specie, and while it would not curtail public works, none would be added. Buchanan urged the states to restrict the banks to a credit level of $3 to $1 of specie, and discouraged the use of federal or state bonds as security for bank note issues. Though the economy recovered by 1859, the panic inflamed sectional tensions, as many Northerners blamed the Southern-backed Tariff of 1857 (passed during Pierce's last day in office) for the panic. Southerners, as well as Buchanan, instead blamed the over-speculation of Northern bankers. In part due to the worsened economy, by the time Buchanan left office the federal deficit stood at $17million, higher than it had been when Buchanan took office. Throughout 1858 and 1859, Congress continued to debate perennial issues such as the tariff and infrastructure spending. Southern and Western congressmen succeeded in retaining the low rates of the Tariff of 1857 until 1861. Many in Congress pushed for the construction of a transcontinental railroad, but its construction was prevented by a combination of Southern and New England congressmen. Among the pieces of legislation that Buchanan vetoed were the Homestead Act, which would have given 160 acres of public land to settlers who remained on settled land for five years, and the Morrill Act, which would have granted public lands to establish land-grant colleges. Buchanan argued that these acts were beyond the power of the federal government as established by the Constitution. Following the secession of several Southern states, Congress passed the Morrill Tariff, significantly raising rates. Despite his long opposition to higher tariffs, Buchanan signed the tariff into law on March 2, 1861. The Morrill Tariff raised the tariff to the highest levels seen since the 1840s, and passage of the law marked a new period of protectionist tariffs that would continue long after Buchanan left office. Utah had been settled by Mormons in the decades preceding Buchanan's presidency, and under the leadership of Brigham Young the Mormons had grown increasingly hostile to federal intervention. Young harassed federal officers and discouraged outsiders from settling in the Salt Lake City area, and in September 1857 the Utah Territorial Militia perpetrated the Mountain Meadows massacre against Arkansans headed for California. Buchanan was also personally offended by the polygamous behavior of Young. Accepting the wildest rumors and believing the Mormons to be in open rebellion against the United States, Buchanan sent the army in November 1857 to replace Young as governor with the non-Mormon Alfred Cumming. While the Mormons had frequently defied federal authority, some question whether Buchanan's action was a justifiable or prudent response to uncorroborated reports. Complicating matters, Young's notice of his replacement was not delivered because the Pierce administration had annulled the Utah mail contract. After Young reacted to the military action by mustering a two-week expedition destroying wagon trains, oxen, and other Army property, Buchanan dispatched Thomas L. Kane as a private agent to negotiate peace. The mission succeeded, the new governor was shortly placed in office, and the Utah War ended. The president granted amnesty to all inhabitants who would respect the authority of the government, and moved the federal troops to a nonthreatening distance for the balance of his administration. Though he continued to practice polygamy, Young largely accepted federal authority after the conclusion of the Utah War. After the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854, two competing governments had been formed in Kansas Territory. The anti-slavery settlers organized a government in Topeka, while pro-slavery settlers established a seat of government in Lecompton, Kansas. For Kansas to be admitted as a state, a constitution had to be submitted to Congress with the approval of a majority of residents. Under President Pierce, a series of violent confrontations known as ""Bleeding Kansas"" occurred as supporters of the two governments clashed. The situation in Kansas was watched closely throughout the country, and some in Georgia and Mississippi advocated secession should Kansas be admitted as a free state. Buchanan himself did not particularly care whether or not Kansas entered as a slave state, and instead sought to admit Kansas as a state as soon as possible since it would likely tilt towards the Democratic Party. Rather than restarting the process and establishing one territorial government, Buchanan chose to recognize the pro-slavery Lecompton government. In his first Annual Message to Congress, in December 1857, he urged that Kansas be admitted as a slave state under the Lecompton Constitution. Historians have taken one of two approaches to the Kansas policy. Allan Nevins presents a ""melodramatic"" interpretation. He argues that Buchanan honestly wanted a constitution ratified by genuine residents. His firmness weakened in the face of pro-Southern factions in his cabinet and party and he retreated. Roy Nichols takes a ""legalist"" approach arguing that Buchanan only submitted one issue, slavery itself, to the voters. But he became distracted by the financial panic of 1857 and accepted the Lecompton Constitution. Nevins and Nichols agree on Buchanan's weak leadership, but offer subtle variations on how Buchanan tried to hold the middle ground by accepting a de facto slavery settlement. Upon taking office, Buchanan appointed Robert J. Walker to replace John W. Geary as territorial governor of Kansas, with the mission of reconciling the settler factions and approving a constitution. Walker, who was from the slave state of Mississippi, was expected to assist the pro-slavery faction in gaining approval of a new constitution. Buchanan overcame Walker's initial reluctance to accept the appointment by persuading Walker that a successful resolution to the Kansas issue could catapult Walker to the presidency in 1860. Buchanan also promised Walker that Kansas would hold a free and fair referendum on any state constitution. Shortly after arriving in Kansas, Walker remarked that an ""isothermal line"" (i.e. the climate) had made Kansas unsuitable to slavery, angering pro-slavery leaders in Kansas and across the United States. In October 1857, the Lecompton government organized territorial elections that resulted in a pro-slavery legislature, despite Walker's discovery of fraud in several counties. The convention framed a pro-slavery state constitution (known as the ""Lecompton Constitution"") and, rather than risking a referendum, sent it directly to Buchanan. Though eager for Kansas statehood, even Buchanan was forced to reject the entrance of Kansas without a state constitutional referendum, and he dispatched federal agents to bring about a compromise. The Lecompton government agreed to a limited referendum in which Kansas would vote not on the constitution overall, but rather merely on whether or not Kansas would allow slavery after becoming a state. The anti-slavery Topeka government boycotted the December 1857 referendum, in which slavery overwhelmingly won the approval of those who did vote. A month later, the Topeka government held its own referendum in which voters overwhelmingly rejected the Lecompton Constitution. Despite the protests of Walker and two former governors of Kansas, Buchanan decided to accept the Lecompton Constitution. In a December 1857 meeting with Stephen Douglas, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories and an important Northern Democrat, Buchanan demanded that all Democrats support the administration's position of admitting Kansas under the Lecompton Constitution. Facing re-election and outraged by the perceived fraud in Kansas, Douglas broke with Buchanan and attacked the Lecompton Constitution. On February 2, Buchanan transmitted the Lecompton Constitution to Congress. He also transmitted a message that attacked the ""revolutionary government"" in Topeka, conflating them with the Mormons in Utah. Buchanan made every effort to secure congressional approval, offering favors, patronage appointments, and even cash for votes. The Lecompton Constitution won the approval of the Senate in March, but a combination of Know-Nothings, Republicans, and Northern Democrats defeated the bill in the House. Rather than accepting defeat, Buchanan backed the English Bill, which offered Kansans immediate statehood and vast public lands in exchange for accepting the Lecompton Constitution. Despite the continued opposition of Douglas, the English bill won passage in both houses of Congress. Despite congressional approval of the constitution, Kansas voters strongly rejected the Lecompton Constitution in an August 1858 referendum. Southerners were outraged that the Lecompton Constitution had been defeated by a supposed Northern conspiracy led by Douglas, while many Northerners now saw Buchanan as a tool of the Southern ""Slave Power."" Anti-slavery delegates won a majority of the elections to the 1859 state constitutional convention, and Kansas won admission as a free state in the final months of Buchanan's presidency; the Southern senators blocking a free Kansas had withdrawn, because their states had seceded. Guerrilla warfare in the state would continue throughout Buchanan's presidency and extend into 1860s, when it became a relatively minor theater of the wider American Civil War. The battle over Kansas escalated into a battle for control of the Democratic Party. On one side were Buchanan, most Southern Democrats, and ""doughface"" Northern Democrats; on the other side were Douglas and most Northern Democrats, as well as a few Southerners. Douglas's faction continued to support the doctrine of popular sovereignty, while Buchanan insisted that Democrats respect the Dred Scott decision and its repudiation of federal interference with slavery in the territories. The struggle lasted the remainder of Buchanan's presidency. Buchanan used his patronage powers to remove Douglas' sympathizers in favor of pro-administration Democrats. Douglas's Senate term ended in 1859, so the Illinois legislature elected in 1858 would determine whether Douglas would win re-election. The Senate election was the primary issue of the legislative election, marked by the Lincoln-Douglas debates between Douglas and the Republican candidate, former Congressman Abraham Lincoln. Buchanan, working through federal patronage appointees in Illinois, ran candidates for the legislature in competition with both the Republicans and the Douglas Democrats. This could easily have thrown the election to the Republicans—which showed the depth of Buchanan's animosity toward Douglas. In his 1858 re-election bid, Douglas defeated Lincoln, who warned that the Supreme Court would soon bar states from excluding slavery. As part of his campaign, Douglas laid out his ""Freeport Doctrine"", which held that territorial legislatures retained the de facto right to exclude slavery despite the Dred Scott decision, because said legislatures could refuse to recognize slavery as property. In the 1858 elections, Douglas forces took control of the Democratic Party throughout the North, except in Buchanan's home state of Pennsylvania, leaving Buchanan with a narrow base of Southern supporters. However, the Freeport Doctrine further diminished Douglas's support in the South, which was already in decline following his refusal to support the Lecompton Constitution. The division between Northern and Southern Democrats helped the Republicans win a plurality in the House in the elections of 1858. While campaigning for a Republican congressional candidate in New York, Republican Senator William Seward described the party struggle between Republicans and Democrats as part of a larger ""irrepressible conflict"" between systems of free and slave labor. Though Seward quickly walked back his remarks and relatively few Northerners actually sought the immediate abolition of slavery in the South, Seward's remarks and the subsequent Republican victories in the 1858 elections caused many in the South to believe that the election of a Republican president would lead to the abolition of slavery. The election losses served as a Northern rebuke to the Buchanan administration, and Republican control of the House allowed Republicans to block much of Buchanan's agenda in the second half of his term. Following the 1858 elections, Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi and fellow Southern radicals sought to pass a federal slave code that would protect slavery in the territories, thereby closing the loophole contemplated by Douglas's Freeport Doctrine. In February 1859, as debate over the federal slave code began, Davis and other Southerners announced that they would leave the party if the 1860 party platform included popular sovereignty, while Douglas and his supporters likewise stated that they would bolt the party if the party platform included a federal slave code. Despite this continuing debate over slavery in the territories, the decline of Kansas as a major issue allowed unionists to remain a powerful force in the South. In October 1859, abolitionist John Brown led raid on a federal armory in Harpers Ferry, Virginia, in hopes of initiating a slave revolt. Brown's plan failed miserably, and the majority of his party was killed or captured. In the aftermath of the attack, Republican leaders denied any connection to Brown, who was executed in December 1859 by the state of Virginia. Though few leaders in the North approved of Brown's actions, Southerners were outraged, and many accused Republican leaders such as Seward of having masterminded the raid. In his December 1859 annual message to Congress, Buchanan characterized the raid as part of an ""open war by the North to abolish slavery in the South"", and he called for the establishment of a federal slave code. Senate hearings led by Senator James Murray Mason of Virginia cleared the Republican Party of responsibility for the raid after a long investigation, but Southern Congressmen remained suspicious of their Republican colleagues. Buchanan entered the White House with an ambitious foreign policy centered around establishing U.S. hegemony over Central America at the expense of Great Britain. He hoped to re-negotiate the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty, which he viewed as a mistake that limited U.S. influence in the region. He also sought to establish American protectorates over the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora, partly to serve as a destination for Mormons. Aware of the decrepit state of the Spanish Empire, he hoped to finally achieve his long-term goal of acquiring Cuba, where state slavery still flourished. After long negotiations with the British, he convinced them to agree to cede the Bay Islands to Honduras and the Mosquito Coast to Nicaragua. However, Buchanan's ambitions in Cuba and Mexico were blocked in the House of Representatives, where the anti-slavery forces strenuously opposed any move to acquire new slave territory. Buchanan also considered buying Alaska from the Russian Empire, possibly as a colony for Mormon settlers, but the U.S. and Russia were unable to agree upon a price. In China, the U.S. was neutral in the Second Opium War of 1856–58. Buchanan appointed William Bradford Reed as Minister to China in 1857–58. Reed helped Buchanan win in 1856 by persuading old-line Whigs to support a Democrat. Reed's goal in China was to negotiate a new treaty that would win for the United States the privileges Britain and France had forced on China in the war. Reed did well. The Treaty of Tientsin (1858) granted American diplomats the right to reside in Peking, reduced tariff levels for American goods, and guaranteed the free exercise of religion by foreigners in China. The treaty helped set the roots of what later became Washington's Open Door Policy.  In 1858, Buchanan ordered the Paraguay expedition to punish Paraguay for firing on the USSWater Witch, which was on a scientific mission. The punitive expedition resulted in a Paraguayan apology and the payment of an indemnity. Buchanan and his allies awarded no-bid contracts to political supporters, used government money to wage political campaigns and bribe judges, and sold government property for less than its worth to cronies. According to historian Michael F. Holt, the Buchanan administration was ""undoubtedly the most corrupt  before the Civil War and one of the most corrupt in American history."" In March 1860, the House created the Covode Committee to investigate the administration for evidence of corruption, bribery, and extortion. The committee, with three Republicans and two Democrats, was accused by Buchanan's supporters of being nakedly partisan; they also charged its chairman, Republican Congressman John Covode, with acting on a personal grudge due to Buchanan's veto of a land grant bill for agricultural colleges. Despite this criticism, the Democratic committee members, as well as Democratic witnesses, were equally enthusiastic in their pursuit of Buchanan as were the Republicans. The committee was unable to establish grounds for impeaching Buchanan; however, the majority report issued on June 17 exposed corruption and abuse of power among members of his cabinet, as well as allegations (if not impeachable evidence) from the Republican members of the committee, that Buchanan had attempted to bribe members of Congress in connection with the Lecompton constitution. The Democratic report, issued separately the same day, pointed out that evidence was scarce, but did not refute the allegations; one of the Democratic members, Rep. James Robinson, stated publicly that he agreed with the Republican report even though he did not sign it. Buchanan claimed to have ""passed triumphantly through this ordeal"" with complete vindication. Nonetheless, Republican operatives distributed thousands of copies of the Covode Committee report throughout the nation as campaign material in that year's presidential election. The 1860 Democratic National Convention convened in April 1860 in Charleston, South Carolina. Buchanan had decided to stick to his pledge to serve just one term, but his administration actively sought a successor who would uphold his policies. Stephen Douglas had emerged as the most popular Northern Democratic leader after the 1858 elections, but he had alienated Buchanan and much of the South with his stance on slavery in the territories. Some Southern Democrats, especially those from the Deep South, preferred a Republican president to Douglas because the election of a Republican president would encourage secession. After a long and acrimonious fight, the convention adopted a platform favoring Douglas's conception of popular sovereignty and rejecting a federal slave code. Seven Southern delegation chairmen walked out on the convention in reaction to the party platform. After Southern leaders bolted from the convention, Caleb Cushing, a Buchanan ally who had won election as chair of the convention, ruled that the presidential ballot would require a two-thirds majority of all delegates (including the bolters), meaning that the nominee would have to win support from five-sixths of the delegates present. After fifty-seven ballots, all of which Douglas led, the convention adjourned with plans to reconvene in June in Baltimore, Maryland. After re-convening, most of the remaining Southern delegates, as well as some Northern delegates loyal to Buchanan, left the convention after losing a vote to re-seat the delegates that had bolted in Charleston. The remaining delegates nominated Douglas for president. Douglas preferred Alexander H. Stephens as his running mate, but left the decision to the remaining Southern delegates, who eventually picked former Governor Herschel Johnson of Georgia. The delegates who had bolted from the Charleston and Baltimore conventions met elsewhere in Baltimore. After stating that he did not believe that the South should secede if Republicans won the 1860 election, Vice President Breckinridge was nominated on the first ballot of the convention. Senator Joseph Lane of Oregon was nominated as Breckinridge's running mate. Buchanan and former President Franklin Pierce both endorsed Breckinridge and his platform, which called for the federal protection of slavery in the territories. A group of former Whigs opposed to both Breckinridge and the Republicans, and unable to reach an accommodation with Douglas, formed the Constitutional Union Party and nominated John Bell of Tennessee for president and Edward Everett of Massachusetts for vice president. The nascent party emphasized unionism and sought to push aside the issue of slavery. Though the party initially hoped to compete in both the North and the South, some Constitutional Unionists in the South endorsed a federal slave code, which destroyed the party's support in the North. The 1860 Republican National Convention opened with five major candidates Abraham Lincoln, William Seward, Salmon P. Chase of Ohio, Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania, and Edward Bates of Missouri. Despite Seward's lead on the first two ballots, Lincoln emerged as the party's nominee on the third ballot. Lincoln's candidacy was boosted by the widely-held view that his reputation for honesty and moderation made him a strong candidate, especially in key Northern swing states like Indiana and Illinois. For vice president, the Republicans nominated Hannibal Hamlin, a former Democrat from Maine who maintained warm relations with both Lincoln and Seward. Republicans, including Seward, rallied to Lincoln as did many former Whigs. Lincoln argued for the containment of slavery to the Southern states, but promised that Republicans would not seek to abolish slavery in the South itself. With four major candidates in the field, Buchanan hoped that not one candidate would win an electoral vote majority and the election would be thrown to the House. The 1860 election was essentially two races; in the North, Lincoln competed with Douglas for votes, while in the South, Breckinridge and Bell garnered the most support. Like his successful Whig predecessors, Lincoln largely refrained from campaigning after the convention, instead leaving that to others in the party. In his silence, Lincoln failed to refute the charge of Southern radicals that he hoped to abolish slavery. During the summer and fall of 1860, Southern governors corresponded about potentially seceding from the union, and Buchanan did little to denounce secessionists. Douglas, on the other hand, focused much of his campaign on attacking secessionists, who he worried would attempt to seize control of the federal government in the aftermath of a Lincoln victory. As Breckinridge and Bell lacked support in the North, the defeat of Lincoln required the victory of Douglas in at least some Northern states, but Buchanan remained focused on defeating Douglas. Some anti-Republican leaders attempted to form a fusion ticket in the North, but they achieved little success outside of New Jersey. With the Democrats divided, Lincoln won the 1860 election with a plurality of the popular vote and a majority of the electoral vote. Lincoln won virtually no support in the South, but his strong performance over Douglas in the North gave him a majority of the electoral vote. Breckinridge won most of the South, Bell won Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee, and Douglas won Missouri and three electoral votes in New Jersey. Despite Lincoln's presidential victory, Republicans failed to win a majority in the House or Senate, and the Supreme Court membership remained largely the same as it had been when it issued the Dred Scott decision. Thus, despite the election of a Republican president, slavery in the South faced no immediate danger. As early as October, the army's Commanding General, Winfield Scott, warned Buchanan that Lincoln's election would likely cause at least seven states to secede. He recommended that massive amounts of federal troops and artillery be deployed to those states to protect federal property, and warned that few reinforcements were available. Buchanan, however, distrusted Scott (the two had long been political adversaries) and ignored his recommendations. After Lincoln's election, Buchanan directed Secretary of War Floyd to reinforce southern forts with as much provisions, arms and men as were available; however, Floyd convinced him to revoke the order. With Lincoln's victory, talk of secession and disunion reached a boiling point. A Cincinnati newspaper wrote, ""the doctrine of secession is anarchy. If any minority have the right to break up the government at pleasure, because they have not had their way, there is an end of all government."" In his annual message, delivered on December 3, 1860, Buchanan blamed the crisis entirely on Northerners and their anti-slavery agitation. He also argued that the Constitution made no provision for secession and that such an act would be unconstitutional. He stated that a ""revolution"" is justifiable in some instances, but argued that the South should wait for an ""overt or dangerous"" act before resorting to such a drastic action. Despite his opposition to secession, Buchanan argued that the president had no power to coerce states to remain in the Union, though he did state the president could defend federal property in seceding states. Finally, Buchanan asked Congress to call a convention of states to propose a constitutional amendment that would recognize slaves as property throughout the United States. His address was sharply criticized both by the North, for its refusal to stop secession, and the South, for denying its right to secede. Historian Jean H. Baker explains Buchanan's behavior in terms of his Southern leanings, his long‐standing friendship with Southerners, and his choice of strong Southern personalities for his cabinet. She suggests that if it had not been for Joseph Holt, Edwin Stanton, and Jeremiah Black, Buchanan might have recognized the Confederate States of America. During the lame duck session of the 36th Congress, the Senate established the Committee of Thirteen in an attempt to defuse the crisis. The committee consisted of a mix of Northern Democrats, Southern Democrats, and Republicans. Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky proposed a package of constitutional amendments known as the Crittenden Compromise. The compromise would protect slavery in federal territories, current and future, south of the 36°30′ parallel. Congress would be forbidden from abolishing slavery in any state or interfering with the domestic slave trade. President-elect Lincoln refused to acquiesce to any extension of slavery into the territories, as he feared that the compromise would encourage Southern leaders to attempt to annex new territory South of the 36°30′ parallel in order to extend slavery. He also believed that adoption of the Crittenden Compromise would set a precedent through which Southern leaders could use the threat of secession to extract concessions. On Lincoln's direction, a majority of the Republicans on the committee opposed the Crittenden Compromise, and it was defeated by a combination of Republican and Southern votes. Crittenden nonetheless brought his package to the Senate floor, where was defeated in a 25-to-23 vote on January 16, 1861. In 1850, Southern extremists had called the Nashville Convention in an attempt to organize the simultaneous secession of Southern states. In 1860, pro-secession leaders pursued a state-by-state strategy, hoping to trigger a chain reaction by leading states to secede one-by-one. A minority of leaders in the Deep South, including Alexander Stephens, opposed secession before Lincoln made a move that would threaten slavery in the Southern states. However, the wide popularity of secession in the Deep South precluded delay until after Lincoln took office. As Congress scrambled to devise a compromise acceptable to North and South, the first Southern state seceded. South Carolina, long the most radical Southern state, declared its secession on December 20, 1860. The state ordnance of secession accused the North of having ""assumed the right to decide upon the propriety of our domestic institutions"" and also declared that the Republican Party believed that ""a war must be waged against Slavery until it shall cease throughout the United States."" After declaring its own secession, South Carolina sent commissioners to the other Southern states. By February 1, 1861, another six states had seceded. Conventions in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Florida overwhelmingly voted to secede, while unionists in Alabama and Georgia put up a stronger, but still unsuccessful, fight. In a referendum, two-thirds of Texans also voted to secede, despite the opposition of long-time Texas leader Sam Houston. The other eight slave states rejected secession, though North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, and Arkansas would later secede during Lincoln's presidency. The seceded states organized into the Confederate States of America, and Jefferson Davis was elected as the Confederacy's first president on February 9. After trying in vain to convince Lincoln to publicly support a constitutional convention or a national referendum on the Crittenden Compromise, Buchanan sent a special message to Congress, asking it to authorize a referendum or find some other method of compromise that would allay the fears of the South. Leaders in both the North and South competed for the allegiance of the upper South, and both attempted to project an image of moderation. The House of Representatives established the Committee of Thirty-Three to help foster a compromise to prevent more states from seceding. Charles Francis Adams Sr. put forth a proposal to admit New Mexico as a slave state, but the lack of slaves in that territory led most congressmen to believe that it would become a de facto free state. With the support of Seward and Lincoln, the Committee of Thirty-Three put forth a resolution to repeal all state personal liberty laws, which were designed to make enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act more difficult. The committee also proposed the Corwin Amendment, which would bar Congress from interfering with slavery in the states. A significant number of Republicans refused to support the Corwin Amendment, but it passed both of the houses of Congress and was proposed to the states for ratification. On February 4, delegates convened from most states outside of the Deep South convened in Washington for the Peace Conference of 1861, which was chaired by former President John Tyler. The convention proposed a solution similar to the Crittenden Compromise, with the major change being that slavery would be protected only in current territories below the 36°30′ parallel. Republican opposition to the Peace Conference's proposal killed its chances, and its proposals were rejected by Congress. The Corwin Amendment would never be ratified by the requisite number of states, but as Congress did not set a time limit for its ratification, the amendment is still technically pending. With all compromise efforts failing, and with several Southern states having seceded, Buchanan's final days in office would be dominated by the issue of federal forts in the South, especially Fort Sumter. All sides recognized that the status of Fort Sumter and two other forts located near Charleston could decide whether or not the South would secede peacefully. As long as they remained under federal control, they would be a symbol of federal power, but a Southern attack on a federal fort could spark a civil war. Because whichever side that fired the first shot would look like the aggressor and pay a price in the crucial border states, many Southerners hoped to persuade Buchanan to peacefully surrender the forts. Shortly after Lincoln's election, Buchanan and Secretary of War Floyd had appointed Major Robert Anderson to command Fort Sumter and the other two nearby federal installations. Buchanan ordered Anderson to hold the forts while avoiding any act that would provoke aggression. On December 27, Anderson evacuated from the more vulnerable Fort Moultrie. Meeting with several Southern leaders, Buchanan acknowledged that Anderson's actions had gone against his orders, but he refused to remove Anderson or surrender the forts. Outraged, Secretary of War Floyd, who himself was from Virginia, resigned. Buchanan considered ordering Anderson to return to Fort Moultrie, but his Northern cabinet members, who now made up a majority of the cabinet, threatened to resign. Buchanan instead composed a public message in which he stated that he would do all within his power to defend Fort Sumter, thereby rallying Northern support. Key anti-Confederate leaders included the new Attorney General Edwin Stanton and the new Secretary of War Joseph Holt. On January 5, 1861, Buchanan decided to reinforce Fort Sumter, sending the Star of the West with 250 men and supplies. However, Buchanan failed to ask Major Anderson to provide covering fire for the ship, and it was forced to return North without delivering troops or supplies. Following the expedition, the last of Buchanan's Southern cabinet members resigned. The Buchanan administration debated ways to reinforce Fort Sumter, but Anderson did not ask for supplies and Buchanan was content to deliver the issue of Fort Sumter to President Lincoln. In February, South Carolina became part of the Confederate States of America. The Confederate Congress authorized President Davis to take the fort by any means necessary, but the Confederates would not strike until after the end of Buchanan's presidency. On March 3, a message from Anderson reached Buchanan stating that Fort Sumter's supplies were running low. The following day, Buchanan was succeeded by Lincoln, who was left to deal with the crisis that soon became the American Civil War. Three new states were admitted to the Union while Buchanan was in office: The day before his death, Buchanan predicted that ""history will vindicate my memory"". Historians have defied that prediction and criticize Buchanan for his passivity as the debate over slavery tore at and disrupted the country in the late 1850s. In terms of his legacy to American history, historian Michael Todd Landis links Buchanan closely to his top advisor Jehu Glancy Jones: Leading Northern Democrats such as Jones and Buchanan were not romantic defenders of working men, as some scholars have claimed; nor were they moderates striving to save the Union from extreme sectionalism. Rather, they were proslavery activists whose willful actions had direct and disastrous effects on the nation. Their policies enraged free-state voters and caused the fatal split in the Democratic Party that resulted in Lincoln's election, which, in turn, triggered disunion. They were culpable and responsible—a fact that should not be forgotten or overlooked. When asked to rank the best and worst presidents, Buchanan is consistently placed among the worst. Many consider him as the worst president in American history, for during his administration, the Union broke apart, and when he left office, civil war threatened. A 2017 C-SPAN survey ranked him the least effective U.S. president of all time. The survey asked 91 presidential historians to rank the 43 former presidents (including then-outgoing president Barack Obama) in various categories to come up with a composite score, resulting in an overall ranking; Buchanan was ranked 43rd. His rankings in the various categories of this most recent poll were: public persuasion (43), crisis leadership (43), economic management (43), moral authority (43), international relations (43), administrative skills (41), relations with congress (42), visionsetting an agenda (43), pursued equal justice for all (43), performance with context of times (43). A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association's Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Buchanan as the second-worst president. A 2006 poll of historians ranked Buchanan's failure to prevent the Civil War as the worst mistake ever made by a sitting president. Buchanan biographer Philip Klein explains the challenges Buchanan faced: Buchanan assumed leadership ... when an unprecedented wave of angry passion was sweeping over the nation. That he held the hostile sections in check during these revolutionary times was in itself a remarkable achievement. His weaknesses in the stormy years of his presidency were magnified by enraged partisans of the North and South. His many talents, which in a quieter era might have gained for him a place among the great presidents, were quickly overshadowed by the cataclysmic events of civil war and by the towering Abraham Lincoln."" Biographer Jean Baker is less charitable to Buchanan: Americans have conveniently misled themselves about the presidency of James Buchanan, preferring to classify him as indecisive and inactive ... In fact Buchanan's failing during the crisis over the Union was not inactivity, but rather his partiality for the South, a favoritism that bordered on disloyalty in an officer pledged to defend all the United States. He was that most dangerous of chief executives, a stubborn, mistaken ideologue whose principles held no room for compromise. His experience in government had only rendered him too self-confident to consider other views. In his betrayal of the national trust, Buchanan came closer to committing treason than any other president in American history. Quite apart from the moralistic evaluations of Buchanan's failures, historians have recently been asking new questions about exactly how his administration worked. Michael L. Carrafiello argues: In the 1990s, however, a group of eminent antebellum historians declared that much more work needed to be done on Buchanan and his presidency. History's verdict on Buchanan, they said, cannot merely be that he was the antithesis of Lincoln. They suggested a number of questions on Buchanan that remained to be answered including ""How did he define his presidential role?"" and ""What was his concept, his view, of the power of the presidency?"" In addition, there are other recurring questions concerning the Buchanan presidency such as ""Why did Buchanan assemble such a weak cabinet?""; ""What were his real views of the institution of slavery?""; ""And how could he have believed that the Supreme Court through the Dred Scott decision would provide a definitive settlement to the slavery issue?""

"Yuzuru Hanyu, a former competitive figure skater from Japan, participated in the Winter Olympic Games three times, winning two gold medals (in 2014 and 2018) and placing fourth in 2022. In 2014, he became the first Asian men's singles skater to win at the Olympics. At 19 years old, he was also the youngest male skater to win the Olympic title since American Dick Button in 1948. In 2018, Hanyu became the first male single skater in 66 years to win two consecutive Olympic gold medals since Button in 1952. In his three Olympic seasons, Hanyu skated to three different short and free skate programs each, with their background and making being broadly covered by the media. In the first season, 2013–14, he became the first Asian and second skater across all disciplines to win the Olympics, Worlds, and the Grand Prix Final in the same season, after Russian Alexei Yagudin in 2001–02. Hanyu also set two world records in the short program, becoming the first skater to score above 100 points in that competition segment, at the 2014 Winter Olympics. In 2017–18, he set another short program record of 112.72 points, which remained the standing record in the old +3-3 GOE judging system. At the 2017 Rostelecom Cup, he also landed his first quadruple Lutz jump in competition. In his third and last Olympic season, 2021–22, Hanyu won his sixth national title and went for the quadruple Axel jump for the first time, with his attempt at the Beijing Olympics being the closest in competition up to then. On July19, 2022, he announced his decision to conclude his competitive figure skating career and turn professional. For his achievements at the Winter Olympics, Hanyu was bestowed with the People's Honor Award by the prime minister of Japan as well as two Medals of Honor with Purple Ribbon. He was also selected as a recipient of the Kikuchi Kan Prize for his accomplishments in figure skating, including his back-to-back titles at the Winter Games. Two monuments honoring his Olympic wins were installed at the International Center Station in his hometown of Sendai. Hanyu was listed in ESPN's World Fame 100 and The Dominant 20 along with Forbes' 30 Under 30 Asia for his successful Olympic season in 2018. In 2022, he was ranked sixth in the list of most-searched athletes on Google Search worldwide. In the 2010–11 season, Hanyu moved up to senior level as the reigning World and National Junior champion as well as the Junior Grand Prix Final winner. He faced significant competition in the Japanese senior field, including Daisuke Takahashi, Nobunari Oda, Takahiko Kozuka, and Tatsuki Machida, who all had finished ahead of him at the previous Japan Figure Skating Championships. In that season, Hanyu landed his first successful quadruple jump, a quad toe loop, and won his first medal at a main international senior competition at the 2011 Four Continents Championships, where he placed second behind Takahashi. After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, which had caused severe damage to his home rink in Sendai, Hanyu was forced to move his training base for the rest of the season. He participated in 60 ice shows to get additional practice time and raise money for the areas affected by the disaster. He launched the following season at the 2011 Nebelhorn Trophy, where he won his first gold medal at an international senior competition. During the event, he shared his career goals with the media: My goals for the future are to land all quad jumps in competition. I would also like to learn the quad Axel. Another goal is to win the next two Olympics, or at least win medals. At the 2012 World Championships, Hanyu became the youngest Japanese World medalist, finishing third behind then two-time world champion Patrick Chan and Daisuke Takahashi, who both acknowledged Hanyu as a potential strong rival in the future. Upon the conclusion of the 2011–12 season, Hanyu changed coaches from Nanami Abe, with whom he had trained since 2004, and moved to Canada to train with Brian Orser at the Toronto Cricket Club. His main motivation for the change were the consistent quadruple jumps by Orser's student Javier Fernández. The move resulted in immediate success; in the following season, Hanyu landed his first quad Salchow in international competition and set his first two world records in the short program segment. He also beat Chan for the first time in competition at the Grand Prix Final in Sochi, which served as a test event for the 2014 Winter Olympics, and won his first national senior title at the 2012–13 Japan Championships, defeating the reigning and five-time national champion, Daisuke Takahashi. Despite a knee injury and ankle sprain, he managed to finish fourth at the subsequent World Championships behind Patrick Chan (gold), Denis Ten (silver), and Javier Fernández (bronze), helping to secure three berths for the Japanese national team at the 2014 Winter Olympics.: 3 For his first Olympic season, Hanyu returned to his short program ""Parisienne Walkways"" from the 2012–13 season. The music piece is a medley of the songs ""Parisienne Walkways"" by Gary Moore and ""Hoochie Coochie Man"" by the Jeff Healey Band from their album Live at Montreux 1999. Hanyu scored two world records with the program in his two Grand Prix events in the previous season. ""Parisienne Walkways"" was the first of Hanyu's multiple collaborations with Canadian choreographer Jeffrey Buttle. For Buttle, who was also choreographing a short program for the defending three-time world champion Patrick Chan in the same season, it was important to highlight the different strengths of the two skaters. In Hanyu's case, Buttle wanted not only to create a program that fit the wild abandon in his skating but also to help him to overcome his shyness and have some fun. He pointed out Hanyu's engagement and active role in the creation of the choreography: ""It's always nice to have someone who will sort of play along with the choreography instead of just standing and waiting for me to say something"". Later, in 2018, Buttle named ""Parisienne Walkways"" as the most memorable of the three programs he had choreographed for Hanyu up to then. He praised Hanyu's ability to pull in the audience and his maturity as a performer at such young age. The costume for the program was created by Japanese costume designer Tadashi Nagashima. For the 2013–14 season, the color of the shirt was changed from grey to blue. For the free skate, Hanyu selected the music from Franco Zeffirelli's film Romeo and Juliet (1968) composed by Nino Rota. In the 2011–12 season, he had already performed to Craig Armstrong's soundtrack of Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo+ Juliet (1996), earning him his first world championship medal. The music piece was Hanyu's personal choice; the program was meant to mark the culmination of his first four senior seasons. The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, his success at the 2012 World Championships, and the subsequent coaching change were three key events of that period that influenced his decision, as he stated: ""I spent two years with Nanami Abe in Sendai and another two years with Brian and his team in Toronto. I wanted to create a program that expresses my gratitude for these four years."" Romeo+ Juliet was the first free skate program he had skated after the earthquake, having performed it at multiple ice shows across Japan. The support he had received from his fans, coaches, and family at that time made the music piece meaningful and precious to him. However, he switched from Armstrong's to Rota's soundtrack for the Olympic season as he thought it stood out the most among the different versions of Romeo and Juliet, and he had long wished to skate to that specific music piece. Hanyu asked Canadian choreographer David Wilson to create the program for him, but Wilson felt ""conflicted"" because he had previously created choreography to the piece for many skaters, including Sasha Cohen's free skate program for the 2006 Winter Olympics. In his letter to Wilson, Hanyu stressed his desire to skate to Rota's soundtrack and win the Olympics with it: ""I don't want to wait until the next Olympics to be the Olympic champion, I want to be the Olympic champion now. And I'm willing to do anything to make that happen, so please, please help me."" Wilson, who had already rejected Hanyu's request to skate to The Phantom of the Opera in the previous season, eventually agreed after realizing that Hanyu would use the music piece either way. The costume of the program was designed by American figure skater Johnny Weir, whom Hanyu named as one of his skating idols, and made by Stephanie Handler. The color and shape of the top were influenced by Weir's personal preference for ""white and sparkly"" costumes. Hanyu's first competition of the Olympic season was the 2013 Finlandia Trophy, where he won the gold medal after placing first in both competition segments, setting unofficial personal best scores with 180.93 points in the free skate and 265.59 in the combined total. His assignments in the 2013–14 Grand Prix series were the Skate Canada International and Trophée Éric Bompard. At Skate Canada, he moved up from third place in the short program to second overall and won silver behind Patrick Chan. Hanyu expressed his disappointment with both performances, having received negative grades of execution (GOE) for all three attempted quadruple jumps and another three jumping passes. At the Trophée Éric Bompard, he skated a clean short program and improved his world record score from the 2012 NHK Trophy by 0.05 points. However, he finished second behind Chan, who had scored world records in all three competition segments with 98.52 points in the short program, 196.75 in the free skate, and 295.27 in the combined total. The two second-place finishes qualified Hanyu for the 2013–14 Grand Prix Final in Fukuoka, where he placed first in the short program and set a new world record with 99.84 points. He also won the free skate despite a fall on the quadruple Salchow, scoring new personal bests of 193.41 in the free skate and 293.25 in the combined total, and claiming his first Grand Prix Final title. In December 2013, Hanyu competed at the Japan Championships, where he went on to win his second national title after placing first in both competition segments. His scores of 103.10 in the short program and 297.80 in the combined total both exceeded the incumbent world records. However, they were not officially recognized as new highest scores because the International Skating Union (ISU) only recorded results that were achieved at international competitions, not national championships. Hanyu was subsequently appointed as part of the Japanese team for the 2014 Winter Olympics and World Championships. Hanyu went into his first Olympics as one of the gold medal favorites besides Patrick Chan, Daisuke Takahashi, and Russian Evgeni Plushenko, the 2006 Olympic champion as well as the 2002 and 2010 Olympic silver medalist. Hanyu participated in the men's short program of the inaugural figure skating team event, where he competed for the first time against Plushenko whom he had admired growing up. Hanyu performed a clean program and scored an Olympic event record of 97.98, winning that segment and earning 10 points for the Japanese team, which had finished fifth at the end of the event. In the short program of the men's individual event, Hanyu broke his world record with a score of 101.45, becoming the first skater in history to surpass 100 points in the short program. He went into the free skate with a near four-point lead ahead of Patrick Chan, but fell on the opening quad Salchow and put both hands down on a triple flip. Despite the mistakes, Hanyu managed to place first in the segment and score new Olympic records of 178.64 in the free skate and 280.09 overall, surpassing Plushenko's and Evan Lysacek's winning scores from the two previous Winter Games by more than 20 points. In the final standings, Hanyu finished first ahead of Patrick Chan (silver) and Denis Ten (bronze), capturing the first Olympic gold medal for Japan in the men's singles event. It was the second Olympic title in figure skating for the nation, following Shizuka Arakawa's win in the women's event at the 2006 Winter Olympics. Hanyu's victory also marked the first time an Asian country won gold in the men's event, and he became the youngest Olympic men's champion since American Dick Button in 1948. In addition, he was the only Japanese athlete across all sports to win gold at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. After the competition, Hanyu expressed his dissatisfaction with the free skate, but also his determination as the reigning Olympic champion to become stronger and work hard to create a new era, pledging to compete again at the next Winter Olympics in 2018.: 2  Hanyu concluded the season with a victory at the 2014 World Championships in Saitama. He sat in third place after a fall on a quad toe loop in the short program, trailing fellow Japanese skater Tatsuki Machida by about seven points. Hanyu came back with a strong free skate, landing both planned quadruple jumps successfully, and claimed his first world title with a total score of 282.59, winning by one of the smallest margins of 0.33 points ahead of silver medalist Machida. Hanyu became the first Asian and second skater across all disciplines to win the Olympics, Worlds, and the Grand Prix Final in the same season, after Alexei Yagudin in 2001–02. He finished the season being ranked first in the world standings and the season's world rankings. On April26, 2014, after returning to his hometown of Sendai, a parade was organized by Miyagi Prefecture, Sendai City, and Miyagi Prefecture Skating Federation to celebrate Hanyu's Olympic gold medal. It was held along the Higashi Nibancho Street in the city center and attended by about 92,000 people. Two days later, Hanyu was bestowed with the Medal of Honor with Purple Ribbon by the Government of Japan for his contributions in sports. In May 2015, the Madame Tussauds museum in Tokyo unveiled a life-size wax figure of Hanyu in the costume and ending pose of his Olympic short program ""Parisienne Walkways"". On July15, 2022, the costume on the wax figure was changed to the one, which he had used for his free skate program Origin in the 2019–20 season. In memory of Hanyu's and Shizuka Arakawa's victories at the Winter Olympics, two monuments were installed in April 2017 in their hometown near the south exit of the International Center Station on the Sendai Subway Tozai Line. Like his wax figure, Hanyu's monument also depicts the ending pose of the ""Parisienne Walkways"" program. In his second Olympic cycle, Hanyu improved his short program results, having scored above 100 points five times in 17 international competitions before the 2017–18 season. However, in 2014–15, he was struggling with his technical layout, which featured a quadruple toe loop and a triple-triple combination placed in the second half. The issue continued at the 2015 Skate Canada, where he placed sixth in the segment with two invalid jumping passes. While his coach Brian Orser suggested a more ""conservative"" change, Hanyu decided to add another quad, stating: ""I thought by the time of the Pyeongchang Olympics, you cannot win without a short program that includes two quads with difficult entries and exits—plus excellent footwork, spins, and presentation. As the reigning Olympic champion, I want to be absolutely dominant."" The offensive strategy earned him back-to-back world records at the 2015 NHK Trophy and the Grand Prix Final, the latter remaining the highest score with 110.95 points until the Olympic season. In his short program at the 2016 Autumn Classic, he also became the first skater to land a quadruple loop jump in international competition. In the free skate segment, Hanyu was the dominant skater of the Olympic cycle, having set three world records as well as the highest score in all three seasons before 2017–18. At the 2015 NHK Trophy, he became the first skater to score above 200 points, improving Patrick Chan’s previous record by almost 20 points. Hanyu cleared the 200 mark five times before the Olympic season, including his performance at the 2015–16 Grand Prix Final, which earned him maximum scores for four technical elements as well as 24 perfect marks of 10.00 in the program components. In 2016–17, he increased the technical difficulty of his free skate, which featured four quadruple jumps, including a quad loop. At the 2017 World Championships, he became the first skater to surpass 220 points with a score of 223.20, which remained the standing record until the Olympic season. In July 2022, Hanyu named this free skate performance of his program Hope and Legacy as the one that he thought would represent him best and was the most perfectly executed of his competitive career.: 1 Despite a series of injuries, including a heavy crash with Chinese skater Yan Han in the warm-up at the 2014 Cup of China, Hanyu managed to become the first skater to win four consecutive Grand Prix Finals. He also added a second world title and two more national titles to his medal record and became the first skater to score above 300 points in the combined total. However, he also suffered defeats by Javier Fernández at two World Championships as well as American Nathan Chen at the 2017 Four Continents Championships in Pyeongchang, which served as a test event for the 2018 Winter Olympics. By the end of the 2016–17 season, four other skaters had also passed 300 points in the combined total score: Fernández, Chen, Jin Boyang, and Hanyu's compatriot Shoma Uno. For the short program, Hanyu decided to use Ballade No.1 in Gminor, Op.23, composed by Frédéric Chopin and performed by Krystian Zimerman, for a third time after the 2014–15 and 2015–16 season. With the program, he set back-to-back world records at the 2015 NHK Trophy and the Grand Prix Final. The latter remained the incumbent record until the Olympic season. Ballade No.1 was also the first and only short program to score above 110 points at that time. The program was choreographed by Jeffrey Buttle, who supported Hanyu's decision to reuse Ballade No.1 for the Olympic season. In his opinion, it was important to choose a piece that the skater was familiar and comfortable with when facing the additional pressure at the Olympics. In May 2017, Hanyu debuted the Olympic version of Ballade No.1 at the Japanese touring ice show Fantasy on Ice in Makuhari with a new distribution of the elements, various choreographic changes, and increased technical difficulty, including a quadruple loop jump as well as a quad toe loop-triple toe loop combination in the second half of the program. On the third day of the show, for the first time, he skated a televised clean short program that featured a quad loop. After the show, Hanyu stated in an interview that he preferred the placement of the steps and spins in the layout he had used at the 2015 NHK Trophy, while in the new version the jumps matched the musical structure of the program better. He also noted that the new layout resembled the original choreography of the program, with the opening jump entered and exited by a spread eagle, and a quadruple toe loop placed in the second half. However, compared to his performances from the 2014–15 season, Hanyu now had the required technical skills to realize his and Buttle's initial vision for the program. The original costume of Ballade No.1 was designed and created by Tadashi Nagashima. The design used at the 2017 Rostelecom Cup and the 2018 Winter Olympics was the fourth version of the costume. Compared to the version of the 2015–16 season, the most striking changes were the additional rhinestones at the collar and the removal of golden trim at the waist and sleeves. For the free skate, Hanyu decided to repeat his program Seimei to the soundtrack of the films Onmyōji and Onmyōji II (The Yin-Yang Master) composed by Shigeru Umebayashi. In the 2015–16 season, he set back-to-back world records with the program at the NHK Trophy and the Grand Prix Final, becoming the first skater to score above 200 points in the free skate. The good results and strong performances at past events encouraged him to bring back the program for the Olympics: ""I was able to perform well to that music so I knew I wanted to use it in the Olympic season. I've been saving it for this occasion"". Compared to the technical layout of the 2015–16 season, Hanyu planned to increase the difficulty of the program, with a quad Lutz and quad loop as the first two elements and another three quadruple jumps in the second half. He also noted the improvements in the program's composition compared to the previous season and his aim to create ""strong, attacking choreography"". In the program, Hanyu portrayed the onmyōji Abe no Seimei, a Japanese astronomer of the Heian period in the 10th century. He debuted the program at the Dreams on Ice show in June 2015 and shared his thoughts on the music choice, stating: ""I want to expand my performing scale, and I want to do something Japanese. I think among all amateur male skaters, I am the one who fits traditional Japanese style the most"". Alongside the movies' storyline, which contains fantastical elements as well as energetic battle scenes, Hanyu wanted to illustrate the duality of sensitivity and strength, femininity and masculinity, that he believes to exist in every human being.: 2 The program was choreographed by Canadian ice dancer Shae-Lynn Bourne, who had created Hanyu's free skate program to The Phantom of the Opera for the 2014–15 season. Not familiar with the historical and cultural background of the music piece, Bourne conducted her own research by watching the movies as well studying the dance movements and story of the program. In an interview, she noted how fast and seamless the process had been and acknowledged Hanyu's active role in it. In August 2022, Bourne named Seimei as the program that left the deepest impression on her among the five free skates she had choreographed for Hanyu in the course of his competitive career. Hanyu's commitment was also noted by Takuya Yamaguchi, the chief priest of the Seimei Shrine in Kyoto, who met Hanyu during his visit and was impressed by his research and knowledge about Seimei. To broaden his performance skills and better incorporate the role of the onmyōji, Bourne advised Hanyu to arrange a meeting with Mansai Nomura, who had portrayed the character in the two movies. A well-known stage actor in the traditional Japanese kyōgen theater, Nomura introduced Hanyu to the basic patterns and movements of kata and gave him advice on his posture and hand movements during the program. Feeling that a Japanese music piece might be better edited by a Japanese music editor, Hanyu personally sent a request to Keiichi Yano. Having a clear vision of the music he wanted, he exchanged over 50 emails with Yano, resulting in a total of 32 different music cuts in a span of one month. In addition, Hanyu recorded his own breath for the opening of the program, stating: ""I want some trigger sound, and I want it to be something like a sound of a breath, not a sound of an instrument."": 1 The costume was designed by Satomi Ito, who had created four different versions of the top between 2015 and 2017. The design was inspired by the clothes of the royal family in the Heian period. The biggest change to the 2015–16 season version was the removal of majority of the embroidery to reduce the weight of the costume. The version created for the 2017 Autumn Classic differed slightly in colors from the Olympic one. Hanyu requested the use of white patterned fabric with purple and green-colored parts as well as a pentagram, one of Seimei's notable symbols. At the 2017 Autumn Classic, his first competition of the season, Hanyu received 112.72 points for his short program, breaking the world record he had set at the 2015–16 Grand Prix Final (110.95). He executed all of his jumping passes cleanly, with two of them receiving the then highest possible grade of execution of +3 unanimously from the judges. Due to pain in his right knee, Hanyu chose not to attempt the quadruple loop in the competition. In the free skate, he performed an error-filled program, placing fifth in the segment and winning the silver medal behind Javier Fernández. After the competition Hanyu noted: ""That seems to be the constant theme to overcome in my skating life—the big gaps between my good performances and my bad performances."" His scheduled competitions for the 2017–18 Grand Prix series were the Rostelecom Cup and NHK Trophy. At the former, Hanyu was second after the short program. He under-rotated and lost his balance on the opening quadruple loop and fell after his jump combination. In the free skate, he landed his first quadruple Lutz in competition and received 1.14GOE for the jump element. Despite making mistakes on two of his other jumping passes, his performance pulled him into first place in the segment, with a score of 195.92. He finished second overall behind Nathan Chen by about three points. On November9, 2017, Hanyu injured a lateral ligament in his right ankle while practicing the quad Lutz. As a result, he withdrew from the NHK Trophy, which automatically disqualified him from competing for his fifth consecutive Grand Prix Final title. With his recovery taking longer than expected, he subsequently decided to also withdraw from the Japan Championships even though the event served as an Olympic qualifier for Japanese skaters. Despite his withdrawal, Hanyu was assured of a spot on the Olympic team, given his top world standing as well as his position as the reigning world champion and defending Olympic champion. On December24, the Japan Skating Federation (JSF) announced that he was assigned to represent Japan at the 2018 Winter Olympics and World Championships. However, he would not participate in the Olympic team event to have more time to practice and prepare at his training base in Toronto for the individual event. Hanyu arrived in South Korea amid intense media coverage on February11, 2018, accompanied by a heavy security detail. His practice sessions at the Olympics were a subject of media scrutiny and attended by hundreds of reporters. At a press conference on February13, held after one of his official practices, Hanyu revealed that he had been off the ice until January and only started executing triple jumps three weeks and quadruple jumps two weeks before the competition. He stated that he still had not decided which technical elements he would use for the individual event. On February16, Hanyu performed a flawless short program, scoring a new Olympic event record of 111.68 points and placing first in the segment. The score was only 1.04 points shy of his personal best and the then world record of 112.72. In the free skate, he performed a solid program that included four quadruple jumps, three of them landed cleanly and the first two receiving maximum scores. He set another Olympic record of 317.85 in the combined total, becoming the first skater to clear 300 points at the Winter Olympics. This result earned him his second consecutive Olympic gold medal, a feat that had not been achieved since Dick Button's back-to-back titles in 1948 and 1952. Hanyu's medal was the 1000th awarded in the history of the Winter Olympic Games. He stood on the podium with his compatriot Shoma Uno (silver) and training mate Javier Fernández (bronze). According to Twitter's database, Hanyu was the most mentioned athlete and his win the most discussed moment of the 2018 Winter Olympics on the social media platform. During a press conference on February18, Hanyu revealed that he had performed his Olympic practices and programs on strong painkillers. He admitted that if he had not been taking medication, he would have been unable to attempt or land jumps. The ankle injury from November, which had led to a three-month hiatus from competing and a lowered technical difficulty of his Olympic programs, was more severe than anticipated, and he would continue to take painkillers until the conclusion of the exhibition gala. Hanyu also stated that his future competition plans were unclear since the injury had not healed yet, and he wanted to focus on full recovery. However, he said he had no intention to quit skating, and that his next goal would be the quadruple Axel, a jump that had not been landed in competition up to then: I want to do  because nobody else has. The jump that has never let me down is the triple Axel. I've probably put more time, practice and energy into it than to any other jump. One of my coaches has called the Axel ""the king of jumps"" and while being grateful to the triple for all it's given me, I'd like to aim for a quad. On March7, 2018, the Japan Skating Federation announced that Hanyu had decided to withdraw from the upcoming World Championships to allow his injured foot to recover. A medical examination after the Olympic Games revealed that the damaged ligaments in his right ankle as well as other unspecified injuries required at least two weeks of rest and three months of rehabilitation to heal. Despite his multiple withdrawals, Hanyu managed to place first in the world standings at the end of the 2017–18 season. In April, he hosted his first self-produced three-day ice show Continues with Wings at the Musashino Forest Sport Plaza in Tokyo, to which he invited skaters who had influenced and inspired him throughout his career. His guest performers included Evgeni Plushenko, Johnny Weir, Shae-Lynn Bourne, Jeffrey Buttle, Takahito Mura, Minoru Sano, and Russian pair skaters Yuko Kavaguti and Alexander Smirnov. Despite not being originally scheduled, Hanyu surprised the spectators and performed a medley of various past programs, skipping jumps due to his injury. The last day of the show was broadcast live to the public in 66 cinemas nationwide. In an interview after the last show, Hanyu reaffirmed his desire to continue skating, announcing his plans to be ready for the 2018–19 Grand Prix series and to ""compete in as many events as possible"". On April22, he paraded in his hometown of Sendai to celebrate his consecutive Olympic gold medals with about 108,000 people in attendance. The event was funded by donations and proceeds earned from selling T-shirts that featured Hanyu's silhouettes and signature, generating an estimated 1.85 billion yen (US$16 million). The profit, worth approximately 22 million yen after deducting the total cost of the parade, was donated to the local figure skating federation for the purpose of strengthening and developing local skaters, including the foundation of a local competition named the Sendai Mayor's Cup. Six days later, Hanyu was awarded the Medal of Honor with Purple Ribbon for the second time. On June1, it was announced that Hanyu would receive the People's Honor Award, a prestigious government commendation bestowed by the Prime Minister of Japan. However, Hanyu declined a commemorative gift which came with the award, stating that he was receiving the People's Honor Award as a representative of the people who supported him. He was the youngest among the 27 recipients since the award's creation in 1977 and the first figure skater to be given the honor. Yoshihide Suga, who had served as Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan at that time, stated that the award had been given to appreciate Hanyu's ""historic achievement"" that ""gave dreams and thrills to the people and hope and courage to society"". In 2019, Hanyu took part in a ceremony in Sendai to unveil the design of a new monument depicting the opening pose of his free skate program Seimei, performed at his second Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. The monument was installed next to the first one, which commemorated his Olympic win in 2014. After the introduction of the new +5-5 judging system in 2018, Hanyu was the dominant skater in the men's short program, having scored above 100 points seven times in eleven international competitions, including three world records. He was also the only skater to score above 110 points multiple times and held the world record with 111.82 points before the 2021–22 Olympic season. The key to Hanyu's success in this competition segment was his high quality elements, well-rounded programs, and consistent Axel jump. At the 2021 World Championships, he landed his 50th triple Axel with positive GOE in his 51st international senior short program. In the free skate segment, Hanyu set two world records in the 2018–19 season and landed five quadruple jumps in one program for the first time in his career at the 2019–20 Grand Prix Final. He also became the first to land a quad toe loop-triple Axel sequence and a quad toe loop-Euler-triple flip combination, and he was the only skater besides Nathan Chen to score above 200 points until the Olympic season. However, Hanyu's struggles with injuries continued and his performance at the 2020–21 Japan Championships was his only free skate with all-positive grades of execution under the new judging system. He suffered defeats at multiple major events, including the 2019–20 Grand Prix Final and Japan Championships, where he placed second behind Chen and Shoma Uno, respectively. Plagued by doubts, Hanyu confessed that there was a moment where he had felt tired of competing. Despite the feeling of having evolved in various aspects of his skating compared to the record-breaking performances in 2015, his scores had become lower, making him wonder if he was ""no longer needed"" and worried if we was being told to retire.: 1 However, he was unwilling to disappoint the people who had supported him and decided to continue competing. In February2020, he took a new approach by returning to his Olympic programs from 2018 and won his first gold medal at the Four Continents Championships, becoming the first male single skater to complete the Super Slam. In the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hanyu moved back from Toronto to Sendai and was coached remotely, training alone at his home rink and creating large parts of his programs' choreography himself. With his third place at the 2021 World Championships behind Chen (gold) and compatriot Yuma Kagiyama (silver), Hanyu helped to secure three Olympic berths for Japanese men and became the second male single skater after German Jan Hoffmann to win seven world medals since World War II. However, he explained that he did not feel the same drive to win the Beijing Olympics compared to the previous Winter Games, and made his goal clear for the 2021–22 season: ""I am aiming for the quadruple Axel, but if the Olympics happen to be on the way to land the quad Axel, I will think about it. However, my primary goal is not to win the gold medal at the Olympics, but to succeed in four and a half revolutions."": 1 For the 2021–22 season, Hanyu chose to skate to Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso, Op.28, composed by Camille Saint-Saëns. For the first time in an Olympic season, Hanyu decided to use a new short program that he had not tested previously in international competition. It was his second program to a composition by Saint-Saëns after ""Notte Stellata (The Swan)"", which he had performed at the exhibition gala of the 2018 Winter Olympics and other events between 2016 and 2019. Hanyu stated that he had been searching for a piano piece for a long time and a short program ""with an expression that only Yuzuru Hanyu can do"". He also stated that Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso was a piece he had always wanted to skate to but felt that a piano version would suit his style better than the original composition for violin and orchestra. He consulted Japanese pianist Shinya Kiyozuka to create a special arrangement for him, stating: ""I thought that if I used an original piano version by Kiyozuka, who gave me the energy to live and skate when I was going through a very hard time last season, I would be able to skate more comfortably."": 1 He wished for a piece that was overflowing with passion, but also carried some sorrow and delicacy. Hanyu had already skated to Kiyozuka's piano version of the Japanese song ""Haru yo, koi"" in various exhibition galas since 2018 and performed with him in a live show collaboration at the 2018 Fantasy on Ice. The foundation of the choreography was laid by Jeffrey Buttle. In order to improve the program regarding different aspects such as the storyline and expression, Hanyu also consulted his coaches Brian Orser, Tracy Wilson, and choreographer Shae-Lynn Bourne. The program reflects his memories and feelings from the time when he did not make any progress with the quadruple Axel, how he tried to push forward, and eventually caught something in his grasp as shown by the final pose. Hanyu noted that regarding the base value of the technical elements, it might not have been the most difficult program he was capable of, but he had increased the complexity of transitions between the elements, stating: ""There is only about one crossover before each jump, there are hardly any crossovers in this program. I certainly want these aspects to be seen. In terms of expression, it might not be as refined as my signature programs like 'Ballade No.1' or 'Seimei' yet, but it is a program with a specific story and feelings woven into the music. I'd like to make it a program where everything can be seen, not only the jumps."": 1  The costume for the program was created by Satomi Ito. Hanyu requested a design using cool colors and a choker-like detail in blue. Ito suggested a style that resembled the costume design of Hanyu's previous short program to ""Otoñal"" by Raúl Di Blasio from the 2019–20 season, and added some golden feathers at its finalization. She described the costume as a ""phoenix veiled in blue flames"" that ""only Hanyu can pull off."" For the free skate, Hanyu decided to reuse the program Heaven and Earth (天と地と, Ten to Chi to) from the previous season and incorporate the quadruple Axel as the first jump. The music is a medley of the opening themes of the two taiga dramas Ten to Chi to (1969) and Shin Heike Monogatari (1972), composed by Isao Tomita.: 5 At the 2020–21 Japan Championships, Hanyu performed a clean free skate and set a new unofficial national record score with the program. In his opinion, a performance with clean and seamless jump execution is essential to convey the meaning and expression of the program. Heaven and Earth was choreographed remotely by Shae-Lynn Bourne, who arranged online meetings and exchanged multiple video mails with Hanyu. Due to the lack of presence-based coaching during the corona pandemic, Hanyu had to work out many parts of the choreography himself. At their first meeting, he already had a concept of the program in mind, including the placement of the technical elements with the required space and breathing. In the program, Hanyu portrayed Uesugi Kenshin, a daimyō from the Sengoku period of Japan in the 16th century, who was said to be the most powerful warlord of his time and known for his belief in the Buddhist war god Bishamonten. However, Kenshin was aware of the hardships and sacrifices attached to it and eventually chose to become a monk. Hanyu's motivation behind the program choice was his strong resonance with Kenshin's situation as well as his values and approach towards battle. In an interview with Sports Hochi in August 2022, Hanyu named Heaven and Earth as the favorite among his past figure skating programs. The first part depicts the fourth battle of Kawanakajima in 1561 between the two daimyōs Uesugi Kenshin and his rival Takeda Shingen. Both aimed to take control over a plain in the Shinano Province, located in the area of today's Nagano city, where Hanyu debuted the program in competition. The step sequence is a visualization of Kenshin's sword dance during the single combat with Shingen, which Bourne described as a ""battle of beauty"". The second part of the program shows Kenshin's reflection on the battle and his life until that point, including his inner conflict of no longer wanting to fight, but being forced to continue in order to protect his loved ones. The program concludes with Kenshin entering priesthood and reaching a state of enlightenment, which is illustrated by the final spins and the ending pose. For Bourne, that pose is a ""true expression of 'heaven and earth'—the feet are firmly attached to the earth (represented by the rink), and the hands are stretched out to the sky. It is an image of ascending towards the light of heaven."" The original Japanese title of the program 天と地と (ten to chi to) literally translates to 'heaven and earth and', which indicates the existence of a third element. In Taoism, heaven (天) and earth (地) are thought to maintain the two poles of the Three Realms of reality, with the middle realm occupied by humanity (人), which Hanyu associated with people and, as an example, himself: ""For me, it is 'ten to chi no hito' (a man between heaven and earth). My arm is the transition between where I am, and the sky above, and the earth below."" For the music editing, Hanyu again consulted Keiichi Yano, who created a total of 18 versions in a span of two and a half weeks.: 5  For Hanyu, it was important to fully utilize the sound of the Japanese lute biwa to structure the program and underline both Kenshin's determination to fight and his reflection on the battle. Hanyu also asked Yano to add the sound of the half-tube zither koto to make the program ""even more 'Japonesque'"". The costume was designed by Satomi Ito, who took the family crest of the Uesugi clan as inspiration for the costume details, including the golden sparrows on the back of the top. Hanyu asked Ito to base the costume design on the image of the traditional Japanese pantskirt hakama in a color scheme of greenish-blue. However, the hakama was difficult to realize as a light figure skating costume, so Ito used the obi, a belt usually worn with a kimono or keikogi, to reproduce the visual appearance of a hakama. For the Olympic season, the color of the obi was changed from blue to black. Approaching the 2021–22 Olympic season, Hanyu was assigned to the Grand Prix series and scheduled for the NHK Trophy and Rostelecom Cup. However, on November4, 2021, the Japan Skating Federation announced that Hanyu had withdrawn from the NHK Trophy after injuring his right ankle ligament during a fall in practice. On November17, the JSF also confirmed his withdrawal from the Rostelecom Cup. Hanyu later revealed that the injury had occurred during one of his free skate run-throughs; when setting up for a quad Salchow consecutively after a quad Axel attempt, the edge of his blade did not glide properly and got stuck in the ice, resulting in the fall. He explained that he had some maintenance issues and just sharpened his blades prior to the accident. Shortly after the injury, he had been forced off practice for one month, suffering from a fever due to esophagitis. In December, Hanyu returned to competition at the 2021–22 Japan Championships. In his first practice session, he attempted multiple quad Axels, one of them with a two-footed landing and slightly short on rotation. According to him, the focus was on maintaining a solid axis during the jump rather than maximizing the torque. The next day, Hanyu debuted his short program Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso with a clean performance, receiving maximum grades of execution for the step sequence and the final spin combination as well as a perfect 10.00 for the interpretation component. He took the lead after the short program with a new event record of 111.31 points, only half a point shy of his own world record set at the 2020 Four Continents Championships. In the free skate, Hanyu attempted the quadruple Axel in competition for the first time, but it was landed on two feet and marked as downgraded by the technical panel, lacking more than a half revolution at the landing. However, he managed to execute the rest of the program flawlessly, earning 211.05 points for his performance. With another event record of 322.36 points in the combined total, he won his sixth gold medal at the Japan Figure Skating Championships, tying Takeshi Honda's record of most national titles in the last 50 years. He finished ahead of Shoma Uno (silver) and Yuma Kagiyama (bronze), who both qualified alongside Hanyu for the 2022 Winter Olympics and World Championships. In an interview after the competition, Hanyu shared his thoughts on winning three Olympic gold medals in a row for the first time: The Olympics to me was a dream through to PyeongChang. I won gold there and in Sochi; that's the dream I had as a child and was my lifelong goal. Honestly, I wasn't thinking about a three-peat. But I recognize the position I'm in, the challenge I'm taking on, and seeing all these athletes working so hard towards the Olympics... I'm the only figure skater who has the opportunity to win a third straight gold medal. This might not be the dream I've always had, but I want to show a renewed strength—one different from last time and the time before that. At the 2022 Winter Olympics, Hanyu was scheduled for the men's singles event as his first international competition of the season. His arrival was highly anticipated, especially among his large fanbase in China, and closely followed by the media. On February6, two days prior to the competition, he arrived at Beijing airport being surrounded by officials in protective gear, who received criticism for the lack of social distancing amidst the corona pandemic. In the short program, Hanyu performed Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso for the first time in international competition. However, he missed his opening quadruple Salchow jump due to his blade getting caught in a hole in the ice. The costly error put him in eighth place with 95.15 points, his lowest short program placement since 2013 and also his lowest score in the segment since the 2019 World Championships. In the free skate, he fell on his two opening jumps, a quadruple Axel and a quad Salchow. After the two mistakes, he delivered a clean performance, placing third in the free skate and fourth overall with a total score of 283.21 points, behind Nathan Chen (gold) and his Japanese compatriots Yuma Kagiyama (silver) and Shoma Uno (bronze). It was Hanyu's first off-podium finish since the 2014 NHK Trophy. His quad Axel attempt received the jump's base value before being reduced for under-rotation, making it the closest attempt in competition until then. In September 2022, American Ilia Malinin successfully landed the first ratified one at the U.S. International Classic, who cited Hanyu as his inspiration to attempt the jump. Upon the conclusion of the men's singles event, it was revealed that Hanyu had re-injured his right ankle in practice the day before the free skate and competed on painkillers. On February14, he shared more details about his injury, stating that the sprain had been worse than initially assumed, and that if it had been a competition other than the Olympics, he might have withdrawn as his doctor had suggested him to rest his ankle for ten days. However, Hanyu decided to participate in the exhibition gala and also performed a medley of past programs to the media and staff members at the practice rink. Asked about his future, he did not rule out the possibility to return to the Olympic Games, stating: ""If you ask me whether these were my last Games, I don't know. The Olympics is a special place, one of a kind. It's a competition, a challenge, that you want to take on even if you're hurt. There's no other place like that for a figure skater. There is a part of me that does want to skate here again."" On March1, 2022, the Japan Skating Federation announced Hanyu's withdrawal from the World Championships, stating that the injury he had suffered at the Beijing Olympics was not fully healed. From May to June, he joined the 2022 Fantasy on Ice tour as one of the lead cast members to four prefectures across Japan. The tour was live-screened in 90 movie theaters nationwide as well as six theaters in Taiwan. During the tour, he jumped multiple quadruple toe loops, indicating that his recovery had been going smoothly. On July19, Hanyu had called a press conference, where he announced his decision to ""step away"" from competitive figure skating at amateur level and turn professional, stating that ""he had achieved everything he could achieve"" and would no longer ""seek those kinds of evaluations."" He stressed his intention to continue pursuing his ""ideal skating"" and dream of completing the quadruple Axel as a professional athlete at an ice show or other non-competitive setting. Despite being unable to provide details on his future plans, he expressed his hope ""to draw even people who don't normally come out to watch skating"". The press conference was live-streamed nationally and covered by major national and international media. On July21, Hanyu released a message through the Japan Skating Federation, and his profile was removed from the federation's list of advanced skaters as requested by ANA, his affiliated organization at that time. On October11, Hanyu was announced to be among the recipients of the 70th Kikuchi Kan Prize, a prestigious award for outstanding achievements in cultural activities, named after Japanese author Kikuchi Kan. Hanyu was selected for his accomplishments in the men's singles discipline, including his win of all major international competitions and back-to-back Olympic titles, as well as his inspirational attitude to continue challenging the quadruple Axel. He is the second figure skater to receive the award after Mao Asada in 2017. The award ceremony was held on December2 in Tokyo. In a video message, Hanyu expressed his gratitude and confessed: ""Most of my life was a path to dreams, a series of hopes and despairs. However, I want to make every choice meaningful. Even if I fail or get injured by my choices, I want them to have a meaning."": 1 Hanyu started off his professional skating career by challenging two of his past Olympic programs. On August10, he shared a two-hour long practice livestream on his newly launched YouTube channel. In the course of that practice session, he attempted his free skate program Seimei from the 2018 Winter Olympics three times and skated a clean performance at last attempt featuring four quadruple jumps. At the end of the session, he remarked: ""My goal this time was to skate a clean performance of Seimei with the same technical layout as at the Olympics in Pyeongchang. Well, I had such a strong will to prove that I was better than that time."": 1 The practice stream was viewed live by more than 100,000 people and reached a total of one million views in 8.5 hours. In the 45th edition of the annual charity program 24-hour TV ""Love Saves the Earth"", broadcast by Nippon TV on August27, Hanyu challenged his short program Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso from the 2022 Winter Olympics to overcome the negative memories of the event. This time, he succeeded at the opening quad Salchow and performed a clean program with two quadruple jumps and a triple Axel. In a subsequent interview he expressed his feelings about the performance: ""I made a mistake at the Olympics—in a way, it was a trauma. That's why I thought, I'd like to challenge it again. I feel that, for the first time, I was able to skate this program to perfection. It was one of those programs that I was too scared to take a step on. But finally, I feel that I was able to get over it and move forward again. I hope that, even if it is only for a second, it will be an opportunity for everyone to move forward."": 1 On February 26, 2023, he again challenged the program in his solo ice show Gift at the Tokyo Dome in front of a record audience of 35,000 spectators. He recreated the setting of the Beijing Olympics with a preceding six-minute warm-up session and skated another clean performance with the same technical content, including a successful opening quad Salchow.: 4 In 2022, Hanyu was ranked sixth in the list of most-searched athletes on Google Search worldwide, behind Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams (all tennis), Manti Te'o (American football), and Shaun White (snowboard). Various news outlets and magazines such as Nikkei Asia and International Figure Skating noted that Hanyu's exit from the competitive circuit marks the ""end of an era"". Juliet Macur of The New York Times remarked that ""we may never see another skater like Yuzuru Hanyu"". Numerous sports figures from and outside figure skating reacted to Hanyu's announcement with gratitude and praise, including Japanese baseballer Shohei Ohtani, gymnast Kōhei Uchimura, and tennis player Naomi Osaka. Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, sent a personal message to Hanyu through the IOC's official media account on Twitter: ""Congratulations on an outstanding Olympic career. You are a true Olympic champion. Good luck for the next steps in your skating career. We will keep following you and look forward to seeing you again."" Yuzuru Hanyu series Other",Normal

"Being Charlie is a 2015 American drama film directed by Rob Reiner and written by Matt Elisofon and Nick Reiner. The film stars Nick Robinson, Common, Cary Elwes, Devon Bostick, Morgan Saylor, Susan Misner and Ricardo Chavira. It was screened in the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival on September 14, 2015. The film was released on May 6, 2016, by Paladin. On his 18th birthday, troublesome addict Charlie, who has been in and out of rehab for years, walks out of a youth rehab facility in rural Utah. He does so without incident as he is legally an adult. As Charlie starts to walk toward the road, he turns back and throws a rock through a stained glass window of the facility's chapel. Hitchhiking, Charlie is picked up by a man and his sick mother. The man agrees to drop him at a bus station after dropping her off home. However when he discovers Charlie has stolen his mother’s oxy cancer treatment, he throws him out of his truck. Charlie calls Adam, his best friend and dealer, to come pick him up. When he arrives home to Los Angeles, his parents stage an intervention. Charlie's father was a Hollywood star who’s running for governor of California. Now, given the choice between another try at rehab or going to jail in Utah for damaging the stained glass, Charlie is forced to go to adult rehab. There, Charlie meets beautiful but afflicted Eva, another enabler. He also meets the typical group of wisecracking misfits, and the surprisingly down-to-earth ex-jailbird drug counsellor. A man at Charlie's most recent inpatient facility who seems the most eager of the group, one day is just gone. Hoping the doctor would give him painkillers, he punched a concrete wall and simply walked away when he didn't get the medication he wanted. The time at the inpatient facility moves by quickly—there's a routine—group meetings, yoga sessions, visits from and meetings with family members, tell your story to get a new chip every month. When Charlie moves to an outpatient house, the routine continues, albeit with some freedom. The head of the house where Charlie stays tries to explain the problem with having a romance during recovery: Recovery is and must be selfish, as addiction is selfish. Hence Charlie’s relationship with fellow addict Eva might not work out. Juxtaposing that blunt but compassionate support is Charlie's mother, who tries to give him the love and encouragement of two parents. After Charlie and Eva have their weekend pass together, while he’s on cloud nine, the look on her face whenever he offers advice or talk about love tells a different story. Fear, desperation and, sometimes, just blankness. At one point, Eva tells Charlie that the program isn't working. He tells her it's different this time. ""It is different,"" she responds, and there's a moment of clear misunderstanding: He thinks it's different because they have each other, while she realizes he doesn't get her. Without warning, Eva leaves. Charlie abandons the outpatient home to find her. Taking a vehicle from his dad’s for the search, he tracks her down to Venice Beach. He declares he loves her, embracing her, but she seems vacant. Taking her to the beach house, although Eva slept in his arms, by morning she’s left, and emptied two bottles of wine. She’s gone for good. Outside of the program, Charlie falls off the wagon. He's on the streets for close to two weeks when he’s robbed. Broke, he seeks out Adam. They party, but at the end he ODs. Charlie is exonerated, but it makes the news. The next day is the election, so he takes off for the beach house. Looking unlikely that David will win his gubernatorial run, he accompanies his inebriated wife to rest, when an aide seeks him out to inform him of his victory. A huge distraction from what really matters, he accepts his win alone. The next day, David seeks out Charlie. They make peace, and Charlie plans to head out into the world. We see as the credits roll, he has become a standup comic. On April 22, 2015, it was announced Nick Robinson, Morgan Saylor, Common, Devon Bostick, Susan Misner, Ricardo Chavira and Cary Elwes would star in the film. Principal photography began in April 2015, and ended on May 7, 2015. The film premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival on September 14, 2015. The film was released on May 6, 2016, by Paladin. Being Charlie received negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 23%, based on 43 reviews, with a rating of 5.0910. The website's critics consensus reads, ""Being Charlie has wonderful intentions and a strong central performance, but an affecting true story gets lost in the script's surfeit of clichés."" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 47 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".",Normal

"Paul Clement Hammond OAM (16 December 1922 – 10 September 2010) was an Australian ballet dancer, teacher and choreographer. Inspired as a teenager by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Hammond started dancing at the age of 17, studying ballet with Mischa Burlakov, Helene Kirsova and Leon Kellaway. From his early twenties, Hammond held numerous senior roles with premier Australian ballet companies. As Principal and Soloist with the Kirsova Ballet, Australia's first professional ballet company, Hammond danced the principal roles in various productions including Les Sylphides, Hansel & Gretel, Swan Lake and Harlequin. He went on to become a Leading Soloist with the Borovansky Ballet — the precursor to the Australian Ballet — for over a decade, and danced in major roles in a range of productions including Symphonie Fantastique, Beau Danube, Petrouchka, Scheherazade, The Outlaw, Sleeping Princess and Giselle. Edouard Borovansky's 1951 production of The Sleeping Princess, in which Hammond appeared as Carabosse, received great critical acclaim and was billed as 'an important milestone in the history of ballet in Australia'. Throughout his early career, Hammond traveled extensively abroad to train and dance as Principal with companies including the Glyndebourne Opera Company (UK) as Assistant Ballet Master and as Principal Dancer in Orpheé. As Principal Dancer with the Metropolitan Ballet (UK) from 1948 to 1950, Hammond performed the lead role in several productions including Prince Siegfried in Swan Lake and Prince Florimund in Sleeping Beauty. As a Principal Dancer with the Théâtre Royal de Monnaie (Belgium), Hammond danced in various opera productions and ballet divertissements including Brahms Variations and Bouquetierre des Violets. In addition to extensive classical ballet training in Australia, Hammond studied ballet in Western and Eastern Europe, with acclaimed teachers including Vera Volkova, Anna Northcote, Lubov Egorova and Olga Preobajenska. In 1948, Sir Robert Helpmann invited Hammond, along with Peggy Sager, to dance in the pioneer ballet film The Red Shoes. In the 1950s, Hammond gained his Advanced Teachers Diploma from the Royal Academy of Dance and in 1953, founded the Paul Hammond Ballet School in Melbourne. Under the management and direction of Hammond, the Paul Hammond Ballet School soon established itself as a leading dance academy, and between 1953 and 1976, produced and trained successful dancers such as Don Asker, Dale Baker, Walter Bourke, Roma Egan, Michaela Kirkaldie, John O’Brien, Gailene Stock, Robert Ray, and Margaret Wilson among numerous others. Following their stage career, many of these dancers went on to become professional teachers, examiners and choreographers in Australian and abroad. For example, Gailene Stock is currently Director of the Royal Ballet School in London; Dale Baker, Michaela Kirkaldie, and Margaret Wilson are resident teachers at the Australian Ballet School; while Tina Stuart is an international examiner for the Royal Academy of Dance. During this time, Hammond choreographed numerous works for television and the stage, including the musical, Lock up your Daughters (Garnet H Carroll), the Union Theatre's original musical production of Lola Montez and a series of ballet productions commissioned by ABC Television. Prior to and in addition to running his own school, Hammond took on many freelance and guest teaching roles including with GTV Channel 9, Crawford TV School, Netherlands Dance Theatre, Luisillo and his Spanish Dance Company, the New Zealand Ballet Company and School, and The Australian Ballet. From 1975 to 1981, Hammond was a Senior Tutor of Classical Ballet at The Australian Ballet School under the direction of Dame Margaret Scott. From 1981 until his retirement in 1995, he was the Archivist and Dance History Tutor at the Australian Ballet School, as well as Archivist for The Australian Ballet company for a short time. Combining his ongoing pursuit for excellence in dance with his passion for and in-depth knowledge of dance history and music, Hammond tutored and mentored scores of successful Australian dancers including Paul Mercurio, Margaret Illman, Steven Heathcote, Christine Walsh, David McAllister and Wendy Walker. Hammond became a Children's Examiner for the Royal Academy of Dance in 1964 and until the 1990s, examined for various bodies including the Royal Academy of Dance, The Australian Ballet School and the Victorian College of the Arts. His adjudication work included the 'Paul Hammond Encouragement Award' (one of the Kathleen Gorham Memorial Scholarships awarded annually), Ballet Teachers' Workshop of Victoria, Victorian College of the Arts, the Green Room Awards and various other Eisteddfods and Australian competitions. Hammond co-founded the Royal Academy of Dance's Victorian Advisory Panel in 1956 and held various roles including Secretary, Chairman as well as Patron. In 1997, he was awarded a Fellowship of the Royal Academy of Dance and a Life Member for his services to the Academy. Hammond co-founded the Ballet Teachers' Workshop of Victoria, and was the Chairman before becoming the Workshops' Patron. In the 1990s, a Ballet Teachers' Workshop scholarship was established in his honour – the Paul Hammond Foundation Scholarship – awarded annually to the most promising senior male ballet student. In 2002, he was awarded a Life Member of the Green Room Awards and from this time until 2008, was a member of the Awards' dance panel. Following his retirement from full-time work, and in addition to his adjudication and patronage commitments, Hammond shared his expertise and knowledge of the arts through volunteer work with the Performing Arts Collection at the Victorian Arts Centre. From 1996 to 2007, Hammond volunteered regularly with the Australian Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne, examining and evaluating local and international archival material on 16mm film.

After receiving his naval aviator wings, he served as a fighter pilot and flew combat missions during the Vietnam War. In 1964 he received a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. Achieving the rank of captain, he retired from the Navy in 1976. Evans was selected as an astronaut by NASA as part of NASA Astronaut Group 5 in 1966 and made his only spaceflight as command Module pilot aboard Apollo 17 in December 1972, the last crewed mission to the Moon, with Commander Gene Cernan and Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt. During the flight, Evans and five mice orbited the Moon a record 75 times as his two crewmates descended to and explored the surface. He is the last person to orbit the Moon alone and, at 147 hours and 43 minutes, holds the record for the most time spent in lunar orbit. During Apollo 17's return flight to Earth, Evans performed an extravehicular activity (EVA) to retrieve film cassettes from the service module. It was the third ""deep space"" EVA, and is the spacewalk performed at the greatest distance from any planetary body. As of 2024, it remains one of only three deep space EVAs, all made during the Apollo program's J-missions. It was the final spacewalk of the Apollo program. In 1975, Evans served as backup Command Module Pilot for the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project mission. He worked on the development of the Space Shuttle before retiring from NASA in March 1977 to become a coal industry executive. Ronald Ellwin Evans was born on November 10, 1933, in St. Francis, Kansas, the son of Clarence Ellwin (Jim) Evans and his wife Marie néePriebe. He had two younger siblings, Larry Joe Evans and Jay Evans. He was active in the Boy Scouts of America where he achieved its second highest rank, Life Scout. He attended St Francis Elementary School. His father served in the United States Navy during World War II. Evans started his secondary education at St Francis High School, but only attended for two months before the family moved to Topeka, Kansas to seek medical treatment for his brother Larry, who was diagnosed with liver cancer. Larry died in 1951, and his parents separated. Evans attended Highland Park High School in Topeka, where he served on the Student Council, and was the president of the Science Club. He was a member of the school American football team, and was an All-Conference guard. His other brother, Dale, secured a football scholarship to Kansas State University where he played college football, and later played professionally for the Denver Broncos. Later Dale served two tours of duty in Vietnam with the United States Marine Corps. Evans decided to study electrical engineering at the University of Kansas. His application was accepted, and he was offered a place starting in September 1951. His family had little money, so in order to pay for his college education he secured a scholarship from the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC). During the fraternities rush week he joined the Sigma Nu fraternity. He earned extra money selling Chesterfield cigarettes, and had a cigarette vending machine installed in the Sigma Nu fraternity house. NROTC training involved a parade for one hour each week, and during the summer break there were midshipman cruises on warships. The first was on the battleship USSWisconsin. In his sophomore year there was an introduction to naval aviation at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas. This experience inspired Evans to become a naval aviator. The third year cruise was to Europe on the USSGwin, a destroyer minelayer. In his junior year he was elected to the Sigma Tau, Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Xi engineering honor societies. During his final summer break he worked in a glass factory to gain general engineering experience. He graduated with his Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering in June 1956. In a letter dated December 12, 1955, the Navy offered Evans a commission as an ensign and designated him a student aviator. He reported to Naval Air Station Pensacola in February 1956 for basic flight training in the Beechcraft T-34 Mentor, and made his first solo flight on May 21. He then progressed to the more powerful North American T-28 Trojan. His flight training then moved to Naval Outlying Landing Field Barin in Alabama, where student aviators practised landing on an aircraft carrier using an outline painted on the runway in the old North American T-6 Texan (known as the SNJ). Six actual landings were then made on the aircraft carrier USSSaipan. Evans returned to Topeka for Christmas leave. There he met Janet Merle (Jan) Pollom, who worked as a secretary at Forbes Air Force Base, and fell in love with her. On January 4, 1957, he reported to Naval Air Station Memphis, where he was taught instrument flying, culminating in a ground-controlled approach test. He then learned how to fly a jet aircraft, the Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star. In a ceremony on April 12 attended by Pollom, her mother, and Evans' mother, the chief of the Naval Air Technical Training Command, Rear Admiral Frank P. Akers handed out certificates to Evans' class designating them as naval aviator. Pollom pinned his aviator wings on his uniform. Evans became a fighter pilot with Fighter Squadron 142 (VF-142), which was based at Naval Air Station Miramar in California, although it was still aboard the aircraft carrier USSHornet when he arrived on July 14, 1957, and did not reach Miramar until July 25. The squadron was due to receive the new Vought F8U Crusader fighter, but these had not yet arrived, and in the meantime they flew the old North American FJ-3 Fury. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant (junior grade), and married Pollom at the Westminster Presbyterian Church of Topeka on December 22, 1957. They had two children: a daughter, Jaime Dayle, and a son, Jon. In January 1959, VF-142 boarded the brand new aircraft carrier USSRanger, and set off on a cruise of the Western Pacific, which lasted until July 27, 1959. Afterwards, most of VF-142 was posted elsewhere, and Evans was one of the five pilots that remained. They took delivery of new model F8U Crusaders, and were joined by new pilots who had to be trained to fly them. The squadron was then assigned to the aircraft carrier USSOriskany, which departed for a tour of the Western Pacific on May 14, and returned to San Diego on December 15. During the voyage, Evans completed correspondence coursework for promotion to lieutenant, and was promoted to that rank in June. With the completion of back to back deployments, he became a flight instructor for the F8U Crusader with Fighter Squadron 124 (VF-124), but until it moved to Miramar in June, he had to fly the Grumman F9F Cougar, although he was able to fly the F8U Crusader once a week or so to stay familiar with it. In 1962, Evans entered the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Fellow students there at the time included Robert H. Shumaker, Gene Cernan, Richard F. Gordon Jr., Paul J. Weitz and Jack Lousma. On June 5, 1963, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) announced that it would be recruiting a new group of astronauts. Military applications were due by July 15. They were pre-screened by the services, and those that the Navy regarded as qualified were contacted and invited to apply. Evans was on leave in Topeka, and received this notification in the form of a telegram. He submitted the required paperwork on July 6. Cernan, Evans, Gordon and Shumaker were among the 34 finalists that NASA invited to undergo a week of medical and physiological tests at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. Six were eliminated at this point; the remaining 28, including Evans, were invited to come to Houston, Texas for interviews and testing. On October 14, Cernan and Evans were both called out of class to take long distance calls from NASA. For Cernan, it was a call from Deke Slayton, NASA's Director of Space Flight Operations, informing that he had been chosen; for Evans, it was one from Al Shepard, informing him that he had not. Evans returned to his studies. The Navy frowned on officers loafing while still drawing pay during the summer break, so the students had to take summer classes. Evans chose to take a course in Russian at the Defense Language Institute at the Presidio of Monterey. He graduated with a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering in 1964. After two years ashore, Evans rejoined VF-124 to re-qualify for aircraft carrier duty. He was then assigned to Fighter Squadron 51 (VF-51), once again flying the F8U Crusader. The ship was already engaged in a combat tour of the Western Pacific on board the aircraft carrier USSTiconderoga, an older sister ship of the Oriskany, so Evans was flown to Naval Air Station Cubi Point in the Philippines, where he collected an F8U Crusader that had been set aside for him, and flew out to the ship. The Ticonderoga returned to San Diego in December 1964. Evans was appointed the squadron maintenance officer, a position usually held by a lieutenant commander, and soon after received a spot promotion to that rank. The Ticonderoga departed for its next Western Pacific cruise in September 1965, but this was not a normal peacetime cruise; the Ticonderoga was assigned to Dixie Station off the coast of South Vietnam, from whence aircraft carriers launched strikes in support of American and South Vietnamese troops engaged in combat operations in the Vietnam War. During a training exercise, Evans collided with his wingman, Lieutenant Roy E. Miller. Evans had to land at Tan Son Nhut Air Base because his aircraft was too badly damaged to be recovered by an aircraft carrier, and it had to be shipped back to the United States for repairs. It was seen by his wife, who recorded a duet of Side by Side with Miller's wife, adding to the ribbing Evans received from his shipmates. Within days he was flying combat missions over South Vietnam. Ordnance was in short supply, so in order to inflate the number of sorties flown, aircraft seldom carried full bomb loads. Evans' aircraft was holed by ground fire. On September 10, 1965, NASA announced that it was recruiting another group of pilot astronauts. Once again, the Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS) contacted Evans and asked if he wanted to volunteer, which he did. On November 12, a package of forms was received by his wife Jan in San Diego, with a cover letter that explained that BUPERS had recommended Evans to NASA. She contacted Slayton, and explained that Evans was on a deployment in the Western Pacific, and was unlikely to be able to return the forms before the December 1 deadline. Slayton reassured her that this would be taken into consideration. Evans managed to mail the forms on December 7. A few weeks later a letter arrived informing Evans that once again he had made the short list, and was invited to come to Brooks Air Force Base for another round of tests. Ticonderoga was back on Dixie station by January 28, and Evans was flying attack missions against Viet Cong insurgents. On that day, his aircraft suffered an electrical failure and he was left with a bomb under his right wing that he was unable to jettison. This made it too dangerous to attempt a landing on the Ticonderoga, so he was ordered to proceed to Cam Ranh Air Force Base, Evans skidded on the wet Marston Mat runway and went 6.1 metres (20ft) off its end. The bomb did not explode. Evans was taken to the office of the base commander, where a United States Air Force sergeant handed him orders to proceed to Texas for astronaut selection. Once again, Evans endured the battery of medical and psychological tests, and was chosen as one of the 35 finalists to be interviewed at the Rice Hotel. His temporary duty assignment only covered the tests, but BUPERS extended it to March 5, and then turned down his squadron commander's request for a replacement officer. As it happened, Evans did not miss much action, as the Ticonderoga departed Subic Bay in the Philippines for Sasebo, Japan, on February 17, but it was back on Dixie Station by March 6. Eleven days later, Evans participated in an attack on Viet Cong units that earned him a Navy Commendation Medal. On March 26, he received word that he had been selected for astronaut training. He was one of the nineteen astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966. Evans completed a seven-month tour of duty flying combat missions. In his Navy service, Evans had logged 2,084 hours of flight time, including 4,600 hours in jet aircraft. He had flown 112 combat missions. In a ceremony on the Ticonderoga's flight deck on April 1, he was awarded gold 516 inch stars in lieu of his second, third, fourth and fifth Air Medals. He flew his last mission, a combat air patrol, on April 21. The Ticonderoga left Dixie station on April 21, 1966, and returned to San Diego on May 16. Evans preceded it, after taking a mail plane to the Philippines, and then a Military Air Transport Service flight to San Diego, which he reached on April 28. He then took a flight to Houston on May 1. The family remained in San Diego until his daughter Jaime finished her school year in late May. In the meantime Evans and Jan bought a four-bedroom house in El Lago, Texas. It was newly built, with no furniture, and the electricity and telephone still to be connected. The family set out for Houston on June 6, taking four days to make the journey in their Rambler station wagon. As their furniture had not yet arrived, they initially stayed in quarters at Ellington Air Force Base. The family was finally able to move in on July 6. Evans' Navy Commendation Medal citation was forwarded to NASA, and the medal was presented to him, along with a silver 516 inch star in lieu of his sixth Air Medal and gold 516 inch stars in lieu of his seventh and eighth, by Robert Gilruth, the director of NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center. In earlier astronaut groups, the senior astronaut had assumed the role of command module pilot (CMP) while the more junior was the lunar module pilot (LMP), but the Nineteen were divided into CommandService Module (CSM) and Lunar Module (LM) specialists. Slayton asked each of the Nineteen which speciality he preferred, but made the final decision himself. This early division of assignments would have a profound effect on their subsequent careers. Evans became a CSM specialist. He was chosen as a member of the support crew for Apollo 1, the first crewed Project Apollo mission, along with Ed Givens and Jack Swigert, two fellow members of his astronaut group. The astronauts assigned to this duty regarded it as the lowest rung on the ladder. Usually low in seniority, they assembled the mission's rules, flight plan, and checklists, and kept them updated, and worked in the simulators developing procedures, especially those for emergency situations. They also stood by during spacecraft tests on the launch pad, and set up the cockpit, ensuring that all the switches were in the right positions. In this role, Evans worked inside the Apollo spacecraft for a couple of hours on January 26, 1967. The support crew then flew back to Houston. On landing at Ellington Air Force Base they were informed that the prime crew had died in a fire inside the spacecraft. When planning for Apollo missions resumed, Evans, Givens and Swigert were assigned to the support crew of Apollo 7, which would now be the first crewed flight.  Givens was killed in a motor vehicle accident on June 6, 1967, and was replaced on the support crew by Bill Pogue. Evans was subsequently a member of the support crew for Apollo 11, the first Moon landing, and he was a capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for Apollo 7, Apollo 11 and Apollo 14. Under the rotation scheme developed by Slayton, the role of backup commander (CDR) for Apollo 13 would have been John Young, the CMP of Apollo 10, and that of Apollo 14 would have been the CMP of Apollo 11, Michael Collins. They would then become the prime crew CDRs of Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 respectively. However, Cernan baulked at reprising his role as LMP with Young, holding out for his own mission. This became available when Collins declined the opportunity to lead a mission to the Moon. Cernan was therefore selected as backup CDR of Apollo 14 in his stead. This was fortunate for Evans as well; Slayton consulted with Cernan about the selection of the rest of his Apollo 14 backup crew, and they chose Evans as CMP and Joe Engle as LMP. The prime crew for Apollo 14 would be Alan Shepard, the Chief of the Astronaut Office as CDR, Edgar Mitchell as LMP and Stu Roosa as CMP. Evans' selection as a member of the Apollo 14 backup crew was formally announced by NASA on August 6, 1969. He was still a serving naval officer, and on October 1, 1969, was promoted to commander. That the backup crew of Apollo 14 would in due course become the prime crew of Apollo 17 as per the rotation scheme was far from certain. The absence of science astronauts on the prime or backup crews of Apollo 13 and Apollo 14 caused adverse reaction in the media, and there was pressure from the scientific community to send a scientist to the Moon. When Slayton announced the crew for Apollo 15 on March 26, 1970, geologist astronaut Harrison Schmitt was named as backup LMP, with Vance Brand as backup CMP and Richard Gordon as backup CDR. Under the rotation scheme, they could expect to become the prime crew for Apollo 18. When Apollo 18 was cancelled in September 1970, the scientific community pressed NASA to assign Schmitt, a geologist, to Apollo 17 rather than a pilot with non-professional geological training. This left Slayton with the question of who would fill the two other Apollo 17 slots: the rest of the Apollo 15 backup crew or the Apollo 14 backup crew (except for Engle). Gordon's crew's experience as backup to Apollo 15 was more relevant for the proposed Apollo 17 mission, as Apollo 15 was a similar J-class mission using the Extended Lunar Module, capable of three-day stays on the Moon, and carrying the Lunar Roving Vehicle. Nor was support for assigning Cernan to Apollo 17 unanimous within NASA; Tom Stafford, the acting chief of the Astronaut office with Shepard assigned to Apollo 14, strongly supported Cernan, with whom he had flown on Gemini 9A and Apollo 10, as did Shepard; but Gordon was supported by James McDivitt, the manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, and Pete Conrad, who had been Gordon's CDR on Apollo 12. Cernan crashed a Bell 47G helicopter into the Indian River near Cape Canaveral during a training exercise in January 1971; the accident was attributed to pilot error, as Cernan had misjudged his altitude before crashing into the water. Slayton dismissed concerns about Cernan's judgment. After being offered command of the mission, Cernan objected to Engle's omission from the crew, but acquiesced when it became clear that Schmitt would fly on Apollo 17 with or without Cernan. The fate of the CMP was tied to that of his CDR. The prime crew of Apollo 17 was publicly announced on August 13, 1971. The original backup crew for Apollo 17, announced at the same time, was the crew of Apollo 15: David Scott as CDR, Alfred Worden as CMP and James Irwin as LMP; but they were removed because of their roles in the Apollo 15 postal covers incident. On May 23, 1972, they were replaced with Young and Duke from the crew of Apollo 16, as backup CDR and LMP respectively, and Roosa from the Apollo 14 crew as backup CMP. Thus, Evans served as Roosa's backup on Apollo 14, and Roosa as Evans' backup on Apollo 17. The two men studied geology with Farouk El-Baz, often on their own time. They became close friends. They would talk about the Moon and the mission at length, and often end with a few beers. Their training was directed at developing the ability to make observations and take photographs of features from orbit. They would fly over geological features in NASA Northrop T-38 Talon jets and tape record their observations and take photographs. These would then be critiqued by geologists. Farouk sometimes flew with Evans or Roosa in the T-38s or small United States Geological Survey aircraft. While suited up for the Apollo 17 mission, but before his helmet was attached, Evans smoked a last cigarette. His crewmates had urged him to quit, and Schmitt suggested that he could take advantage of the two-week mission to go cold turkey. An estimated 700,000 people watched the night launch from the Kennedy Space Center, the largest crowd of spectators since Apollo 11. The flight plan kept Evans busy, making him so tired he overslept one morning by an hour, despite the efforts of Mission Control to awaken him. Before the LM departed for the lunar surface, he had discovered that he had misplaced his pair of scissors, necessary to open food packets. Cernan and Schmitt lent him one of theirs. While Cernan and Schmitt landed on the Moon and explored the Taurus–Littrow valley, Evans remained in lunar orbit on board the Command Module America, completing assigned work tasks which required visual geological observations, hand-held photography of specific targets, and the control of cameras and other highly sophisticated scientific equipment carried in the service module's SIM bay. Cernan and Schmitt referred to Evans as ""Captain America"", after the comic book character. The orbit of the CSM having been modified to an elliptical orbit in preparation for the LM's departure and eventual descent, one of Evans' first solo tasks in the CSM was to circularize its orbit such that the CSM would remain at approximately the same distance above the surface throughout its orbit. Thereafter, he observed ten visual targets that had been assigned prior to launch, all of which were successfully identified during the course of the mission. He focused on surface features as well as the solar corona at ""sunrise,"" or the period of time during which the CSM would pass from the darkened portion of the Moon to the illuminated portion when the Moon itself mostly obscured the sun. To photograph portions of the surface that were not illuminated by the sun while Evans passed over them, Evans relied in conjunction on exposure and Earthlight. Evans photographed such features as the craters Eratosthenes and Copernicus, as well as the vicinity of Mare Orientale, using this technique. According to the Apollo 17 Mission Report, Evans was able to capture all scientific photographic targets, as well as some other targets of interest. The instruments in the SIM bay functioned without significant hindrance during the orbital portion of the mission, though the two antennas of the lunar sounder as well as the mapping camera encountered minor issues. The indicator on the instrument panel for the extension of one of the sounder's antennas was not functional and the second antenna suffered an apparent stall during its extension. Despite these technical difficulties, both antennas were deployed fully and the sounder achieved its planned observational purpose. Similarly, the extension and retraction of the mapping camera took longer than planned (about four minutes, longer than the nominal two) and, though deployment and retraction was not otherwise hindered, the use of this piece of equipment was reduced to avoid exhausting it by overuse. Evans was also responsible for piloting the CSM during the orbital phase of the mission, maneuvering the spacecraft to alter and maintain its orbital trajectory. In addition to the initial orbital recircularization maneuver shortly after the LM's departure, one of the final significant solo activities Evans performed in the CSM in preparation for the return of his crewmates from the lunar surface was the plane change maneuver. This maneuver was meant to align the CSM's trajectory to the eventual trajectory of the LM to facilitate rendezvous in orbit. Evans fired the SPS engine of the CSM for about 20 seconds in successfully adjusting the CSM's orbital plane. He holds the record of most time spent in lunar orbit: 147 hours, 43 minutes and 37.11 seconds. ""Hot diggety dog!"" Evans, upon taking his first steps in space. On the way back to Earth, Evans completed a one-hour, five-minute, 44-second extravehicular activity, during which he made three trips to the scientific instrument module (SIM) bay to retrieve lunar sounder film, the panoramic camera, and three camera mapping cassettes, and completed a personal inspection of the equipment bay area. For this Evans donned Cernan's lunar visor assembly with its red stripe, and the top part of his lunar backpack. He set up the movie camera and TV camera to record the EVA, allowing it to be televised live. After a flight of 301 hours, 51 minutes and 59 seconds, America splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, where it was retrieved by the Ticonderoga. To the dismay of his Apollo 17 crewmates, the first thing that Evans did when he got on board was ask one of the crew for a cigarette. Astronauts normally received a spot promotion on the successful completion of a mission; Evans' promotion to captain was made official in January 1973. He received his Navy astronaut wings from John Warner, the United States Secretary of the Navy. The Apollo 17 crew were fêted at parties and receptions. They were driven around the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum at Super Bowl VII, they met Elvis Presley in Las Vegas and were hosted by President Richard Nixon at the White House and Camp David. Cernan and Evans refused to meet with Muhammad Ali because of the boxer's 1967 refusal to serve in the U.S. armed forces, but accepted hospitality from Frank Sinatra. Evans was later backup CMP for the 1975 Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) mission. The Russian he had learned years before came in handy, but was limited. Asked to give a speech at a cosmonauts' dinner event, he recited Humpty Dumpty in Russian, which his hosts found hilarious. Evans retired from the U.S. Navy as captain on April 30, 1976, with 21 years of service, but remained active as a NASA astronaut involved in the development of NASA's Space Shuttle program. He served as a member of the operations and training group within the Astronaut Office, responsible for launch and ascent phases of the Space Shuttle program. He retired from NASA on March 8, 1977. Jan's parents had retired to live in Sun City, Arizona, and Jan was eager to move to nearby Scottsdale, Arizona, so Evans looked for a job there. A chance encounter led to an offer to become the director of marketing at the Scottsdale-based Western America Energy Corporation. Evans soon became disillusioned with the company and the industry and quit. He then found a position with Sperry Flight Systems, which made electronic components and cockpit instrumentation for the Space Shuttle, as its Director of Space Systems Marketing. But the president of the company who had brought him in died, and Evans had a falling out with his successor. He left to form his own consulting company, and formed a lucrative partnership with a Japanese entrepreneur who was building a theme park devoted to space exploration. Evans died in his sleep of a heart attack at his home in Scottsdale on April 7, 1990, at the age of 56. He was buried at the Valley Presbyterian Church Memorial Garden in Paradise Valley, Arizona, where Jan would leave a red rose on the anniversaries of his birth, marriage, spaceflight and death. Evans was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1973, the Johnson Space Center Superior Achievement Award in 1970, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal in 1973, Navy Astronaut Wings, eight Air Medals, the Vietnam Service Medal, and the Navy Commendation Medal with combat distinguishing service. He received a University of Kansas Distinguished Service Citation in 1973, and was named Kansan of the Year in 1972. He was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983, and the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame on October 4, 1997.",Normal
"Quarterdeck Office Systems, later Quarterdeck Corporation (NASDAQ: QDEK), was an American computer software company. It was founded by Therese Myers and Gary Pope in 1981 and incorporated in 1982. Their offices were initially located at 150 Pico Boulevard in Santa Monica, California and later at 13160 Mindanao Way in Marina del Rey, California, as well as a sales and technical support unit located in Clearwater, Florida. In the 1990s, they had a European office in Dublin, Ireland. Their most famous products were the Quarterdeck Expanded Memory Manager, DESQview, CleanSweep, DESQviewX, Quarterdeck Mosaic, Manifest and Partition-It. On April 18, 1989, Quarterdeck was awarded a US software patent that allowed multiple windowed PC applications under MS-DOS. After sales and its stock plummeted in 1995, interim CEO King R. Lee hired Gaston Bastiaens as CEO. In order to diversify the company's product offerings, Bastiaens began an ultimately unsuccessful acquisition spree. In 1995, the company acquired Landmark Research International Corp. for 3.5 million shares of Quarterdeck (acquiring MagnaRAM and WinProbe) and then Inset Systems, Inc. of Brookfield, Connecticut in September of that year for 933,000 shares of Quarterdeck (acquiring HiJaak graphics software in the deal). In March 1996, Quarterdeck acquired Datastorm Technologies, Inc., publishers of PROCOMM and PROCOMM PLUS, and relocated its technical support and development operations from California and Florida, to Datastorm's Columbia, Missouri headquarters. In July 1996, Quarterdeck acquired Vertisoft Systems, publishers of the DoubleDisk and Fix-It utilities, also for 3.5 million shares of Quarterdeck. Both Landmark and Vertisoft had extensive revenues from direct-marketing of third party products through telemarketing and direct mail. Bastiaens resigned in August 1996, and Quarterdeck continued under acting Co-CEOs King R. Lee, and Anatoly Tikhman, the former CEO of Vertisoft. The company announced a restructuring and a loss, and in January 1997, Quarterdeck hired Curtis Hessler to run the company. In 1998, with its DOS utilities market all but collapsed, Quarterdeck was acquired for $0.52 per share by Symantec (the Norton Utilities company), which discontinued support of some Quarterdeck products, e.g., Mosaic, and integrated others into larger offerings, e.g., CleanSweep, which became part of Norton SystemWorks.",Normal
"The queen angelfish (Holacanthus ciliaris), also known as the blue angelfish, golden angelfish, or yellow angelfish, is a species of marine angelfish found in the western Atlantic Ocean. It is a benthic (ocean floor) warm-water species that lives in coral reefs. It is recognized by its blue and yellow coloration and a distinctive spot or ""crown"" on its forehead. This crown distinguishes it from the closely related and similar-looking Bermuda blue angelfish (Holacanthus bermudensis), with which it overlaps in range and can interbreed. Adult queen angelfish are selective feeders and primarily eat sponges. Their social structure consists of harems which include one male and up to four females. They live within a territory where the females forage separately and are tended to by the male. Breeding in the species occurs near a full moon. The transparent eggs float in the water until they hatch. Juveniles of the species have different coloration than adults and act as cleaner fish. The queen angelfish is popular in the aquarium trade and has been a particularly common exported species from Brazil. In 2010, the queen angelfish was assessed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as the wild population appeared to be stable. The queen angelfish was first described as Chaetodon ciliaris in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, with the type locality given as the ""Western AtlanticCaribbean"". In 1802 it was moved by French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède to the genus Holacanthus, the name of which is derived from the Ancient Greek words ""holos"" (full) and ""akantha"" (thorn). Its specific name ciliaris means ""fringed"", a reference to its squamis ciliatis (""ciliate scales""). Other common names for the species include ""blue angelfish"", ""golden angelfish"" and ""yellow angelfish"". Marine angelfish of the genus Holacanthus likely emerged between 10.2 and 7.6million years ago (mya). The most basal species is the Guinean angelfish (Holacanthus africanus) off the coast of West Africa, indicating that the lineage colonized the Atlantic from the Indian Ocean. The closure of the Isthmus of Panama 3.5–3.1 mya led to the splitting off of the Tropical Eastern Pacific species. The closest relative and sister species of the queen angelfish is the sympatric and similar Bermuda blue angelfish (H. bermudensis), from which it split around 1.5 mya. They are known to interbreed, producing a hybrid known as the Townsend angelfish which has features similar to both parent species. The Townsend angelfish is fertile, and individuals can breed both with each other and with the two parent species. The following cladogram is based on molecular evidence: Rock beauty Bermuda blue angelfish Queen angelfish Clarion angelfish Clipperton angelfish King angelfish Guinean angelfish The queen angelfish has a broad, flattened, oval-shaped body with triangular tail fin, a reduced, dulled snout and a small mouth containing bristle-like teeth. The dorsal fin contains 14 spines and 19–21 soft rays, and the anal fin has 3 spines and 20–21 soft rays. The dorsal and anal fins both dangle behind the body. This species attains a maximum total length of 45cm (18in) and weight of 1,600g (56oz). Males may be larger than females. The species is covered in yellow-tipped blue-green scales, with a bright yellow tail, pectoral and pelvic fins. Both the dorsal and anal fins have orange-yellow end points, while the pectoral fins have blue patches at the base. On the forehead is an eye-like spot or ""crown"" that is cobalt blue with an electric blue outer ring and dotted with electric blue spots. This crown is the main feature distinguishing the species from the Bermuda blue angelfish. Juveniles are dark blue with bright blue vertical stripes and a yellow pectoral area. They resemble juvenile blue angelfish and are distinguished by more curved vertical stripes. Growing juveniles develop transitional patterns as they reach their adult coloration. Seven other color morphs have been recorded off the coast of the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, Brazil. The most commonly recorded is a mostly gold or bright orange morph. Other morphs may be bright blue with some yellow, black or white coloration or even all white. Another color morph was recorded off Dry Tortugas, Florida, in 2009. This fish was mostly cobalt blue with white and yellow-orange colored areas. There are records of at least two wild queen angelfish at St. Peter and St. Paul with a ""pughead"" skeletal deformity, a squashed upper jaw and a lower jaw that sticks out. Such deformities mostly occur in captive fish. Queen angelfish are found in tropical and subtropical areas of the Western Atlantic Ocean around the coasts and islands of the Americas. They occur from Florida along the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea down to Brazil. Their range extends as far east as Bermuda and the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago. Queen angelfish are benthic or bottom-dwelling and occur from shallow waters close to shore down to 70m (230ft). They live in coral reefs, preferring soft corals, and swim either alone or in pairs. Queen angelfish eat sponges, tunicates, jellyfish, corals, plankton, and algae. Juveniles act as cleaner fish and establish and remove ectoparasites from bigger fish. Off St. Thomas Island and Salvador, Bahia, 90% of the diet of adults is sponges. Off the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, more than 30 prey species may be consumed, 68% being sponges, 25% being algae, and 5% being bryozoans. Queen angelfish appear to be selective feeders as the proportion of prey in their diet does not correlate with their abundance. On the species level, the angelfish of the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago target the less common sponges Geodia neptuni, Erylus latens, Clathria calla, and Asteropus niger. Male queen angelfish have large territories with a harem of two to four females. Little is known about the sexual development of the species, though they are presumed to be protogynous hermaphrodites. The largest harem female may transform into a male if the territorial male disappears. Around midday, the females forage individually in different locations. The male tends to each of them, rushing at, circling, and feeding next to them. Spawning in this species occurs year-round. It is observed sometime around a full moon. Courtship involves the male showing his side to the female and flick his pectoral fins at her or ""soaring"" above them. At the beginning of spawning, the female swims towards the surface with the male swimming under her with his snout pressing against her vent. They then deposit their eggs and semen into the water. The female discharges between 25 and 75 thousand eggs a day. After spawning, the pair split and head to back to the ocean floor. The transparent eggs are pelagic and remain suspended in the water for 15–20 hours. The hatched larvae have a large yolk sac with no functional eyes, gut or fins, but two days later, the yolk is absorbed, and the larvae have more of a resemblance to fish. These larvae are plankton-eaters and grow quickly. Between the ages of three and four weeks old, when they have reached a length of 15 to 20mm (0.6 to 0.8in), they descend to the floor as juveniles. Juvenile angelfish live alone and in territories encompassing finger sponges and coral, where they establish cleaning stations for other fish. Queen angelfish are not normally eaten or commercially fished. They are captured mostly for the aquarium trade, where they are highly valued. As juveniles, angelfish can adapt to eating typical aquarium food and hence have a higher survival rate than individuals taken as adults, which require a more specialized diet. In Brazil, the queen angelfish is the most common marine ornamental fish sold aboard. From 1995 to 2000, 43,730 queen angelfish were traded at Fortaleza in the northeast of the country, and in 1995, 75% of marine fish sold were both queen and French angelfish. In 2010, the queen angelfish was assessed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, as the species is only significantly fished off Brazil and the wild population appeared to be secure. Queen angelfish have been caught in the eastern Adriatic Sea, off Croatia, in 2011, and the Mediterranean Sea, off Malta, in 2020. These are likely introductions from the aquarium industry and not natural colonizations. In 2015, an aquarium-introduced angelfish was found in the Red Sea at Eilat's Coral Beach, Israel. Its kidney was infected with the disease-causing bacterium Photobacterium damselae piscicida, which was not previously recorded in Red Sea fish, raising concerns that it could infect native fish.",Normal
"The 1949 Glasgow Corporation elections were held on Tuesday 3 May 1949. The election was held against a wider backdrop of Labour losses across the country, however Labour managed to maintain an overall majority of elected members. The Labour group did see a particularly high-profile loss when the Labour group leader Andrew Hood, the councillor for Provan, lost his seat. The new council was composed entirely of Labour and Progressive members, with all smaller parties having lost their representation. Whilst the Labour party had won a majority of elected members, the corporation also featured two ex-officio members: the Dean of Guild (Lord Inverclyde) and the Deacon-Convenor. Whilst not party affiliated, these members had traditionally voted with the Progressives. As a result, following the election the Progressives John Donald Kelly took over as council leader; the first Progressive council leader since 1933, when Labour had taken control. {{Navbox | name = 1949 United Kingdom local elections | title = (1948 ←) 1949 United Kingdom local elections (→ 1950) | state = | listclass = hlist | group1 = County councils(England) | list1 = | group2 = County councils(Wales) | list2 = | group3 = County councils(Scotland) | list3 = | group4 = County councils(Northern Ireland) | list4 = | group5 = Metropolitan boroughs | list5 = | group6 = County boroughs (England) | list6 = | group7 = Counties of cities(Scotland) | list7 = |group8 = County boroughs(Northern Ireland) |list8 = }}",Normal

"Jason Ellsworth is an American politician serving as a Republican member of the Montana Senate. First elected in 2019, Ellsworth serves as the President pro Tempore of the Montana Senate. In January 2021, Ellsworth was stopped for speeding on the interstate near Helena and told the trooper that he was late to a meeting with Governor Greg Gianforte. The trooper let him go without issuing a ticket. In May 2021, Ellsworth was stopped again by a highway patrol trooper en route to Helena on suspicion of speeding, having been clocked doing 88mph. In the encounter, Ellsworth threatened to contact the state's attorney general on the officer and claimed he couldn't be arrested because he was a lawmaker on his way to legislative work. Ellsworth was subsequently charged for speeding through a construction zone or an alternative charge of reckless driving and obstructing a peace officer. After being selected President Pro Tempore of the Montana Senate around December of 2022, Ellsworth gave a speech in which he said, “We're going to have an opportunity next session, because we're going to have a supermajority, to potentially pass constitutional initiatives, and give those votes to the people.” When asked by a journalist what type of constitutional amendments were being considered, Ellsworth said he did not know any specifics, and that the only reason he made the above statement was because he felt people ""needed to be cognizant of that (the opportunity to pass amendments)...""

"Maurice Simon (19 July 1892 – 24 December 1960) was a Belgian colonial administrator. Maurice Simon was born on 19 July 1892 in Saint-Gilles, Belgium. His education was interrupted by the start of World War I (1914-1918). He served in the army, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre with palm, the Yser Medal and the Legion of Honour (military title). After the war, he graduated in commercial and consular science. At the age of 32, Simon became a territorial administrator 1st class in the Basakata territory of Equateur Province in the Belgian Congo. After seven years, he was given charge of the Lac Léopold II District. In 1931, he was transferred to Ruanda as a deputy resident, at a time when the governor Charles Voisin was preparing to depose the Mwami (King) Musinga. Simon was involved in the enthronement of the successor Mwami Mutara. In 1937, he was transferred to Kivu Province, and from there was assigned to Usumbura as the provincial commissioner of Ruanda-Urundi. In 1947, Simon was made governor of Ruanda-Urundi. He signed various ordinances protecting the forests and wildlife. The United Nations Trusteeship Council held its third session at Lake Success, New York, from 16 June to 5 August 1948. It reviewed the Belgian report on Ruanda-Urundi. Simon attended as Belgium's representative and responded to questions about the report and the administration of the territory. Simon toured Shangugu in 1949, and noted that the land which should have been developed for coffee plantations was still vacant. He wrote, During my last stay in the Shangugu territory, I have noticed ... that between the big road Shangugu-Nyamasheke and the fringe of the forest  there are large surfaces of land practically free of any occupation... At first sight these lands seem fertile and able to be used for cultivation... in such a densely populated country like Ruanda-Urundi it is important not to neglect any arable land... Two possibilities are to be anticipated: (1) intensive occupation by an organized paysannat indigene; (2) colonization by small-scale European agrarian colonists. Simon was succeeded by Léo Pétillon in 1949, and in October 1949, was designated secretary-general of the Belgian Congo, based in Léopoldville. He died on 24 December 1960 in Uccle, Belgium.

He has written books on ethnology of Tai peoples and Ahom, the history and culture of Thailand as well as historical travel of Europeans to mainland Southeast Asia. He retired in 2007, although he still writes about Thailand, releasing a new edition of his book Thailand's Political History in 2010. He authored 11 articles over 47 years from 1972 to 2019 for Journal of the Siam Society. Terwiel was born in Ginneken near Breda in the Netherlands. After his military service in Netherlands New Guinea, Terwiel had to spend a few days in Bangkok due to a lack of transport capacity, which aroused his interest for Thailand. He completed his studies at the Utrecht University with a candidaats degree in Cultural Anthropology in 1965 and a doctorandus degree in anthropology, Pali and the History of Buddhism in 1967. For his doctoral studies, he moved to the Australian National University where he graduated with a Ph.D. in 1972. For his dissertation project, he had himself ordained as a Buddhist monk and lived for a year in a village monastery in central Thailand to explore ceremonies and religious practice of Thai Buddhism from an inner perspective. From 1972 to 1974 Terwiel worked as a coordinator training volunteers at the Dutch Royal Tropical Institute, Amsterdam. Then, he became a lecturer at the Faculty of Asian Studies of the Australian National University in Canberra, where he was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1982 and Reader in Asian History in 1991. In the same year, he was appointed Professor at the Institute of Ethnology of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany.

"During the 2002–03 English football season, Leicester City F.C. competed in the Football League First Division after being relegated from the FA Premier League the previous season. Despite being placed into administration, Leicester managed to regain promotion to the Premier League. In October 2002, Leicester went into administration with debts of £30 million. Some of the reasons were the loss of TV money (ITV Digital, itself in administration, had promised money to First Division clubs for TV rights), the large wage bill, lower fees for players transferred to other clubs than expected and the £37 million cost of the new stadium. Manager Micky Adams was banned from the transfer market for most of the season, until the club was rescued by a takeover by a consortium led by former Leicester striker Gary Lineker. Adams guided Leicester to runners-up spot in Division One and automatic promotion back to the Premiership with 92 points.

Following her Ph.D., she continued at the University of California, Berkeley doing post-doctoral research on a Porter fellowship from the American Physiological Society. In 1938 she moved to Yale University, where she first worked as a postdoctoral investigator and was an instructor from 1941 until 1950 when she moved to Emory University. She taught biochemistry at Emory University from 1950 to 1967. During 1954–57 Russell worked on the committee of the United States National Research Council, then during 1958–64 at the National Science Foundation. She became a full professor at Emory University in 1965. In 1936, Russell spent time working with the Nobel-prize winning couple Carl Ferdinand Cori and Gerty Cori researching the impact of epinephrine and insulin on metabolism. Russell's major research indicated that fasting rats lose muscle glycogen following pituitary removal and injections of pituitary extract can prevent weight loss. She determined the relationship between the anterior pituitary and carbohydrates. Her work allowed the further isolation and identification of growth hormones. Russell was awarded the Kraft Prize, Phi Beta Kappa Key, Steward Scholarship, and University Gold Medal. In 1945 she received the CIBA award of the Endocrine Society. She worked on the National Institutes of Health peer review committee, and was Vice President of the Endocrine Society. Russell was awarded the Upjohn Award of the Endocrine Society in 1961 and elected a member of Sigma Xi. Russell married Alfred Ellis Wilhelmi in 1940. She enjoyed gardening, sewing and origami.

"Tekels Park, Camberley, Surrey consists of about 20 hectares (50 acres) of land, grassland and houses. The estate of Frimley Manor was sold by Henry Tichborne to James Lawrell the elder for £20,000 in 1789. In 1806 the estate was divided. James Lawrell the younger kept what was referred to as Frimley Manor, while Frimley Park mansion and 590 hectares (1,500 acres) of land were sold to John Tekells. John Tekells built a house on the site now known as Tekels Castle. In 1860 Captain Knight and Major Spring bought Frimley Park. They sold Frimley Park mansion with 56 hectares (140 acres) of land to William Crompton Stansfield in 1862. They divided the remnant of the estate between themselves and each built a house. Captain Knight built a new house on virtually the same site as Tekell's previous house. The land on which Captain Knight built Tekels Castle was sold off gradually to meet the demands of new properties to support the new Army Staff College. By 1870 Tekels Park Estate was reduced to 135 hectares (333 acres) of land and was purchased by Major-General Thomas Edmond Byrne (1830–1898). He continued the process of division and when the estate was sold in 1902, to Mr. A. Wilson-Hughes, it was a fraction of its former size. In 1906 the main house burnt down, but the ancillary buildings such as the coach houses and coachman's house and stables survived. In the aftermath of the fire the property remained vacant until 1929 when the members of the Theosophical Society purchased the 34 hectares (85 acres) estate on behalf of the Society. In 1961 the members sold the estate to Tekels Park Estate Ltd. When some of the land was compulsory purchased by the Government in 1964 as part of the M3 motorway, the society chose to sell the land cut off by the motorway from the main establishment, reducing the property to 20 hectares (50 acres), but allowing the Society to build a guest house and make other improvements to the site. 51°19′48″N 0°44′02″W﻿ ﻿51.33°N 0.734°W﻿ 51.33; -0.734",Normal
"China Agritech, Inc. v. Resh, 584 U.S. ___ (2018), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, holding that upon denial of class certification, a putative class member may not, in lieu of promptly joining an existing suit or promptly filing an individual action, commence a class action anew beyond the time allowed by the applicable statute of limitations. China Agritech is incorporated in Delaware and operates primarily in Beijing, China. According to the company, it manufactures and sells various agricultural products to Chinese farmers. China Agritech shares were first listed on NASDAQ in 2005. Four years later, in 2009, China Agritech reported a threefold increase in net revenue. NASDAQ initiated delisting proceedings against China Agritech's stock in 2011 after the company's shareholders made allegations of fraudulent business practices. The company's shareholders filed two successive class action lawsuits in 2011 and 2012, but were denied class certification in both cases. Michael Resh, a shareholder, brought a third class action in 2014. China Agritech moved to dismiss Resh's complaint because the two year limitations period set by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 had already passed. The district court granted China Agritech's motion to dismiss. According to the District Court, under the Supreme Court's prior case, American Pipe & Construction v. Utah, individual claims against the company were tolled during the two class actions filed in 2011 and 2012, but the American Pipe did not reach the issue of whether the tolling rule also applied to a new class action based on a ""substantially identical"" class. The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court, holding that a class action was not time-barred in cases where the plaintiff's were unnamed in the prior lawsuits, even if the complaint was made against many of the same defendants, and based upon the same events.

"The National Tree Plantation Day is an Arbor Day celebrated on 18 August every year. The inception of this occasion stems from Pakistan's achievement of a notable feat on 15 July 2009, whereby 300 volunteers effectively planted 541,176 youthful mangrove saplings within a single day, all achieved without the utilization of mechanical machinery. This remarkable endeavor was undertaken as part of Pakistan's commitment to the Billion Tree Campaign established by the United Nations Environment Program, with the country pledging to plant a total of 120 million trees. National Tree Plantation Day was officially instituted in 2009 by the Pakistani government and then president with the primary objective of promoting consciousness about deforestation and various ecological concerns. In 2010, a new record was set when India successfully planted 611,000 saplings within a span of 24 hours. Nevertheless, Pakistan regained Guinness World Records three years subsequent, as a group of around 300 individuals consisting of forest department personnel, volunteers, and social workers managed to plant approximately 750,000 mangrove saplings in slightly over 12 hours. The Ministry of Environment in Pakistan is responsible for the coordination and arrangement of events and initiatives related to National Tree Plantation Day. On the 18th of August, the entire Pakistani population is urged to engage in tree-planting endeavors that span across the nation. This collective effort aims to achieve the highest possible tree planting count. The observance of this holiday garners extensive media attention and is supplemented by a substantial awareness campaign. Apart from National Tree Plantation Day, Pakistan hosts various other initiatives focused on tree plantation. One instance involves a tree plantation campaign initiated by a Turkish aid agency, dedicated to paying tribute to the martyrs of July 15. Additionally, the Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mahmood Khan introduced a monsoon tree plantation campaign. Prime Minister Imran Khan has spearheaded numerous tree plantation efforts, including the largest-ever plantation campaign during Tiger Force Day, a notable nationwide tree plantation campaign, and the spring tree plantation drive of 2022.

"The Tale of Heiji (平治物語, Heiji monogatari) is a Japanese war epic (gunki monogatari) detailing the events of the Heiji Rebellion of 1159–1160, in which samurai clan head Minamoto no Yoshitomo attacked and besieged Kyoto, as part of an Imperial succession dispute, in which he was opposed by Taira no Kiyomori, head of the Taira clan. The Tale, like most monogatari, exists in three main forms: written, oral, and painted. The original text is sometimes attributed to Hamuro Tokinaga, and is written in 36 chapters. As is the case with most other monogatari, the text has been rewritten and revised many times over the years, and developed into an oral tradition as well. Most often, the Tale of Heiji would be chanted as a continuation of the Tale of Hōgen, which relates the events of the closely related Hōgen Rebellion. The picture scroll version of the tale, called Heiji Monogatari Emaki or Heiji Monogatari Ekotoba, dates from the 13th century. It tells the tale in color on paper, on five scrolls. Each scroll begins and ends with a written portion of the tale, describing the events depicted in a single continuous painting across the length of the scroll. Perhaps the most famous scene of these five scrolls is the Night Attack on the Sanjō Palace. The emaki scrolls are now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in Boston, Massachusetts. A digital reproduction of this scene is visible at http:digital.princeton.eduheijiscroll The Tale of Heiji presents a conflict between old aristocratic and new military elites. The Heiji story moves beyond from the comparatively simple narration template of the Hōgen monogatari towards a more complicated focus which suggests a need for more nuanced principles and more flexible policies which become more appropriate to desperate times. As in the Hōgen story, multi-level and inter-related rivalries lead to war; and the main characters are presented in traditional status order: Emperors and former Emperors first, Fujiwara ministers second, and military clan warriors third. As in the Hōgen story, the narrative structure is divided in three distinct segments: The Japanese have developed a number of complementary strategies for capturing, preserving and disseminating the essential elements of their commonly accepted national history – chronicles of sovereigns and events, biographies of eminent persons and personalities, and the military tale or gunki monogatari. This last form evolved from an interest in recording the activities of military conflicts in the late 12th century. The major battles, the small skirmishes and the individual contests—and the military figures who animate these accounts—have all been passed from generation to generation in the narrative formats of the Hōgen monogatari (1156), the Heiji monagatari (1159–1160), and the Heike monogatari (1180–1185). In each of these familiar monogatari, the central figures are popularly well known, the major events are generally understood, and the stakes as they were understood at the time are conventionally accepted as elements in the foundation of Japanese culture. The accuracy of each of these historical records has become a compelling subject for further study; and some accounts have been shown to withstand close scrutiny, while other presumed “facts” have turned out to be inaccurate.",Normal
"Namık İsmail (1890 in Samsun – August 30, 1935 in Istanbul) was a Turkish Impressionist painter and art educator, who received his training in France. İsmail was born into an upper-class family that moved to Istanbul while he was still a child. After attending the public schools, he was enrolled at the Saint Benoit French High School in Istanbul. Inspired by his father's interest in calligraphy, he also took private art lessons from Şevket Dağ. After he graduated, his father decided to send him to Paris to continue his studies. In 1911, he was admitted to the Académie Julian and later found a position in the workshop of Fernand Cormon. However, he found himself more attracted to Corot and the Barbizon school, as opposed to Cormon's Academic style. He went home for a vacation, but was unable to return to France due to the outbreak of World War I, and served briefly in the Caucasian Campaign. He was mustered out after contracting typhus. In 1917, he had his first showing at the ""Galatasaray Exhibition"" and was awarded a silver medal. Shortly thereafter, he helped establish a workshop in Şişli, together with İbrahim Çallı, Sami Yetik, Ali Sami Boyar, and others, who became known as the ""Çallı Generation"". He also traveled to Berlin to exhibit with Celal Esat Arseven, where they stayed for two years, working with Lovis Corinth and Max Liebermann. In 1919, he returned home and became a teacher at the Osman Nuri Pasha Middle School. The following year, he married Mediha Hanım, daughter of the Mullah Şefik Bey. They separated after ten years of marriage and divorced just two months before his death. He resigned his position at the middle school to travel in Italy. After returning home, he worked as an editorial director at İleri, a republican newspaper, then became an assistant manager at the Sanayi-i Nefise Mektebi (Academy of Fine Arts, now the Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University). In 1925, the Ministry of National Education held a contest to design a new Turkish coat of arms. İsmail won the contest, with an escutcheon that included Asena, a she-wolf from the folktales of the Göktürks, but the design was never used. In 1928, he was appointed director of the academy, which position he held until his death from a heart attack while on a ferry crossing from Kadıköy.",Normal
"Symphony No. 40 in G minor, K. 550 was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1788. It is sometimes referred to as the ""Great G minor symphony"", to distinguish it from the ""Little G minor symphony"", No.25. The two are the only extant minor key symphonies Mozart wrote. The date of completion of this symphony is known exactly, since Mozart in his mature years kept a full catalog of his completed works; he entered the 40th Symphony into it on 25July 1788. Work on the symphony occupied an exceptionally productive period of just a few weeks during which time he also completed the 39th and 41st symphonies (26June and 10August, respectively). Nikolaus Harnoncourt conjectured that Mozart composed the three symphonies as a unified work, pointing, among other things, to the fact that the Symphony No.40, as the middle work, has no introduction (unlike No.39) and does not have a finale of the scale of No.41's. The 40th symphony exists in two versions, differing primarily in that one includes parts for a pair of clarinets (with suitable adjustments made in the other wind parts). Most likely, the clarinet parts were added in a revised version. The autograph scores of both versions were acquired in the 1860s by Johannes Brahms, who later donated the manuscripts to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna, where they reside today. As Neal Zaslaw has pointed out, writers on Mozart have often suggested– or even asserted– that Mozart never heard his 40th Symphony performed. Some commentators go further, suggesting that Mozart wrote the symphony (and its companions, Nos. 39 and 41) without even intending it to be performed, but rather for posterity, as (to use Alfred Einstein's words) an ""appeal to eternity"". Modern scholarship suggests that these conjectures are not correct. First, in a recently discovered 10July 1802 letter by the musician Johann Wenzel (1762–1831) to the publisher Ambrosius Kühnel in Leipzig, Wenzel refers to a performance of the symphony at the home of Baron Gottfried van Swieten with Mozart present, but the execution was so poor that the composer had to leave the room. There is strong circumstantial evidence for other, probably better, performances. On several occasions between the composition of the symphony and the composer's death, symphony concerts were given featuring Mozart's music for which copies of the program have survived, announcing a symphony unidentified by date or key. These include: Most important is the fact that Mozart revised his symphony (see above). As Zaslaw says, this ""demonstrates that  was performed, for Mozart would hardly have gone to the trouble of adding the clarinets and rewriting the flutes and oboes to accommodate them, had he not had a specific performance in view."" The orchestra for the 1791 Vienna concert included the clarinetist brothers Anton and Johann Nepomuk Stadler; which, as Zaslaw points out, limits the possibilities to just the 39th and 40th symphonies. Zaslaw adds: ""The version without clarinets must also have been performed, for the reorchestrated version of two passages in the slow movement, which exists in Mozart's hand, must have resulted from his having heard the work and discovered an aspect needing improvement."" Regarding the concerts for which the Symphony was originally intended when it was composed in 1788, Otto Erich Deutsch suggests that Mozart was preparing to hold a series of three ""Concerts in the Casino"", in a new casino in the Spiegelgasse owned by Philipp Otto. Mozart even sent a pair of tickets for this series to his friend Michael Puchberg. But it seems impossible to determine whether the concert series was held, or was cancelled for lack of interest. Zaslaw suggests that only the first of the three concerts was actually held. The symphony is scored (in its revised version) for flute, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, and strings. The work is in four movements, in the usual arrangement for a classical-style symphony (fast movement, slow movement, minuet, fast movement): The first movement begins darkly, not with its first theme but with the accompaniment, played by the lower strings with divided violas. The technique of beginning a work with an accompaniment figure was later used by Mozart in his last piano concerto (KV. 595) and later became a favorite of the Romantics (examples include the openings of Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto and Sergei Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto). The first theme is as follows. The second movement is a lyrical work in 68 time. It is in the subdominant key of the relative major of G minor (B♭ major): E♭ major. The contrapuntal opening bars of this movement appear thus in keyboard reduction: The minuet begins with an angry, cross-accented hemiola rhythm and a pair of three-bar phrases, as shown in the following piano reduction: Various commentators have asserted that while the music is labeled ""minuet"", it would hardly be suitable for dancing. The contrasting gentle trio section, in G major, alternates the playing of the string section with that of the winds. The fourth movement opens with a series of rapidly ascending notes outlining the tonic triad illustrating what is commonly referred to as the Mannheim rocket. A remarkable modulating passage in which every tone in the chromatic scale but one is played, strongly destabilizing the key, occurs at the beginning of the development section; the single note left out is G (the tonic): This work has elicited varying interpretations from critics. Robert Schumann regarded it as possessing ""Grecian lightness and grace"". Donald Tovey saw in it the character of opera buffa. Almost certainly, however, the most common perception today is that the symphony is tragic in tone and intensely emotional; for example, in The Classical Style, Charles Rosen calls the symphony ""a work of passion, violence, and grief."" Although interpretations differ, the symphony is unquestionably one of Mozart's most greatly admired works, and it is frequently performed and recorded. Ludwig van Beethoven knew the symphony well, copying out 29 bars from the score in one of his sketchbooks. As Gustav Nottebohm observed in 1887, the copied bars appear amid the sketches for Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, whose third movement begins with a pitch sequence similar to that of Mozart's finale (see example below). Franz Schubert likewise copied down the music of Mozart's minuet, and the minuet of his Fifth Symphony strongly evokes Mozart's. Zaslaw has suggested that a passage late in Joseph Haydn's oratorio The Seasons (1801), a meditation on death, quotes the second movement of the 40th Symphony and was included by Haydn as a memorial to his long-dead friend. The symphony has been widely recorded and adapted by many orchestras. Vince Guaraldi adapted the opening theme as a jazz piece in the opening track of his 1964 studio album ""From All Sides"", ""Choro"". Lebanese singer Fairuz also adapted the symphony for her 1972 song “Ya Ana Ya Ana.” The first known recording of the 40th Symphony was issued by the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1915 under the title ""Symphony in G Minor"". The Victor Concert Orchestra performed under the direction of Victor's house conductor, Walter B. Rogers.",Normal
"In behavioral ecology, hyperphagia is a short-term increase in food intake and metabolization in response to changing environmental conditions. It is most prominent in a number of migratory bird species. Hyperphagia occurs when fat deposits need to be built up over the course of a few days or weeks, for example in wintering birds that are preparing to start on their spring migration, or when feeding habitat conditions improve for only a short duration. Mallards may engage in hyperphagia in response to winter floods that temporarily make available more wetlands for foraging, heavily increasing their daily food intake to make use of the additional food.

The Spokane people have lived in what is now AudubonDownriver for hundreds of years. They fished and camped along the banks of the Spokane river and gathered edible crops near a natural spring now known as Drumheller Springs. A trail passed through the neighborhood, giving its name to the North Indian Trail and South Indian Trail neighborhoods to the north. With the arrival of European settlers, prospectors and pioneers began using the trail as well, as it connected Spokane House at the mouth of the Little Spokane River with the settlement of Spokan Falls at the Falls of the Spokane River in present-day Downtown Spokane. Spokane Garry, a prominent member of the Spokane tribe who, as a young man, was given a European education in Manitoba, built a longhouse used as a school at Drumheller Springs in 1860. It was the first school established in what is now Spokane. The springs remained a gathering place for the Spokane people until the 1930s. As the city grew out from its original site along the Spokane Falls in the 1880s, the springs were used to provide water for the expanding city. At this time, pioneer Dan Drumheller located a slaughterhouse in the area, using the water from the springs in the operation. Residential development intensified in AudubonDownriver in the early 1900s. In 1905, Frank P. Hogan and John A. Finch, early Spokane developers and businessmen, donated 33 acres to the city, which became Audubon Park. The donation was made with an agreement that the city would provide landscaping and improvements to benefit the park and Hogan and Finch's housing developments in the area. Finch Elementary, located at the northern edge, was named in his honor. When the Olmsted Brothers gave their 1908 report to the city designing the park system, they included Audubon Park. During the first decades of the 20th century, multiple streetcar lines were laid through the neighborhood. By 1923 streetcar lines stretched from downtown along Northwest Boulevard almost to Garland and from Northwest Boulevard north along Driscoll Boulevard beyond the northern bounds of the present neighborhood. Downriver Golf Course was opened in 1926 along a bend in the Spokane River. The post-World War II housing boom brought further changes to AudubonDownriver as growth accelerated within the neighborhood and stretching north. In 1944, Josie Comstock Shadle, the late wife of Spokane businessman Eugene A. Shadle, donated land to the city to honor her husband, that became the large Shadle Park in the northeast corner of the neighborhood. In 1957, Shadle Park High School, Spokane's fourth, was built on the park's east side to accommodate the increase in growth in and around the neighborhood. Glover Middle School, named after James N. Glover, the founder of Spokane, was built across Shadle Park from the high school one year later. To the east of Shadle Park along Wellesley Avenue, the Shadle Center was opened in 1961 and quickly became a major shopping district for the northwest side of Spokane. It was the first major shopping center outside of the city center. Shadle Center began to decline after being sold to a Los Angeles investment group in 1976. Many of the department stores that were tenants, such as JCPenney, began to shutter their doors. Competition from NorthTown Mall, about a mile east along Wellesley Avenue, proved too much to contend with. However, reinvestment in the first decade of the 21st century revitalized Shadle Center, and as of 2022, it remains one of the north side's top retail areas. A 2003 bond measure led to the modernization of Shadle Park High School, which was completed in 2009. The Shadle Park branch of the Spokane Public Library was renovated in 2021. Prior to 2015, AudubonDownriver was part of the larger Northwest neighborhood. The two were split at Wellesley Avenue in 2015, with the northern half retaining the Northwest name. AudubonDownriver is defined by two areas of dramatically different topographical relief. The deep and steep gorge cut by the Spokane River defines the neighborhood's western boundary while most of the built-up area is located on a relatively flat tableland that slopes up gently to the northeast. The Spokane River enters the neighborhood at roughly 1,680 feet above sea level and falls roughly 80 feet before leaving the neighborhood. It cuts a gorge that rises rapidly and steeply on the AudubonDownriver side. In the far northwest of the neighborhood, the bluff rises nearly 300 feet over a horizontal distance of roughly 500 feet. The bluff is less steep in the southwestern area of the neighborhood, where the public Downriver Golf Course and Downriver Disc Golf Course are located. Away from the river, however, the terrain is comparably quite flat. The bluff that runs east-west across the north side of the city peters out at the Drumheller Springs, near the neighborhood's eastern border. While the terrain climbs 300 feet over a distance of just 500 feet in places along the river, it climbs less than 200 feet from the crest of the river bluff to the neighborhood's high point in the northeast. AudubonDownriver lies within the Okanagan dry forests ecoregion, part of the broader temperate coniferous forest biome. The Okanagan dry forests extend from just south of Spokane northwest through the Okanagan to the Thompson Plateau in British Columbia. Within the developed area of the neighborhood, vestiges of the pre-development ecoregion are visible in the tall ponderosa pine trees, which are common throughout the neighborhood. More intact examples of the ecoregion can be seen in conservation areas such as Drumheller Springs, Downriver Park, and Riverside State Park. Wellesley Avenue bounds the neighborhood on the north, separating it from the Northwest neighborhood. Ash Street forms the eastern border, separating it from North Hill and EmersonGarfield. Fairview Avenue marks the southern boundary from Ash Street west to T.J. Meenach Drive, which it then follows south for a few blocks to the Spokane River, which then defines the border northwest to Wellesley Avenue. Almost all of the AudubonDownriver is zoned as single-family residential. The Shadle Center shopping district, along Wellesley Avenue from Alberta to Belt Streets, is zoned for commercial as a district center. There are also a few neighborhood retail commercial zones with restaurants, shops, and services in the neighborhood, such as at Wellesley and Assembly, Northwest Boulevard, and F Street, along Garland extending a few blocks west from the Garland District in neighboring North Hill, and the easternmost stretch of Northwest Boulevard. Shadle Park is the largest in the neighborhood at 40 acres and the most developed. Shadle Park is home to baseball, softball, basketball, tennis and track sporting facilities. It has a branch of the Spokane Public Library, a theater stage, gazebo shelters, picnic areas, treed lawns, and an aquatic center with a lap pool and water slides. It is also the site of the neighborhood's iconic mid-century green and gold water tower. The 27.6 acre Audubon Park, a community park, has baseball and softball fields, a playground, basketball court, wading pool, picnic area and treed lawns. The 2.3 acre Webster Park, taking up one full city block, is a neighborhood park with a softball field, playground, and treed lawn. Downriver Park is mostly undeveloped conservation land covering 95.3 acres along the Spokane River in the southwest of the neighborhood, with an 18 hole disc golf course. Drumheller Springs is undeveloped conservation land that covers 12 acres. Surrounded by the Downriver Park conservation area is the public, 18 hole Downriver Golf Course. Riverside State Park extends into the neighborhood, downstream of Downriver Park, with campsites at the popular Bowl and Pitcher formation in the Spokane River. Unlike the city parks, state parks charge a fee for users who wish to park or camp on site. Between Downriver Park and Riverside State Park along the riverbank is the Riverside Park Water Reclamation Facility, the largest and oldest wastewater treatment plant in the city. As of 2017, there were 8,813 residents in the neighborhood across 3,732 households, of which 28.2% had children. 19.6% of households were rented, compared to 45.3% citywide. 24.6% of the residents were aged 19 or younger, compared to 21.9% citywide. Those over 65 made up 15.7% of the population, compared to 14.5% citywide. The median household income was $56,444, compared to $44,768 citywide. 31.6% of the population has a bachelor's degree or higher, while 21.4% have at most a high school diploma. The unemployment rate was 3.2% compared to 6.5% citywide. 53.4% of students qualify for free or reduced lunch, compared to 54.5% citywide. 96.2% of residents were born in the United States or one of its territories. Of those born elsewhere, 17% from the United Kingdom, 10.4% from Germany, 10.1% from Mexico and 8.9% from Japan. There are four schools in AudubonDownriver, three public and one private. The public schools are part of the Spokane School District. Finch Elementary, located in the neighborhood, serves the bulk of AudubonDownriver. Audubon Elementary is not located within the neighborhood but serves the southeastern portion of the neighborhood. Willard Elementary, also not in AudubonDownriver, serves a few square blocks in the northeast of the neighborhood. All three feed into Glover Middle School, which is located in the neighborhood. The northwesternmost portion of AudubonDownriver is part of the Browne Elementary district, which is located a few blocks north of AudubonDownriver. Browne feeds into Pauline Flett Middle School, located just north of AudubonDownriver on Wellesley. Even though Shadle Park High School is located in AudubonDownriver, it only serves a small portion of the neighborhood that feeds through Pauline Flett Middle School. The rest of AudubonDownriver feeds into North Central High School. With the exception of some areas along the steep and winding Spokane River bluff, AudubonDownriver is integrated into the city's street grid. Though Northwest Boulevard and Driscoll Boulevard cut across the grid diagonally from the southeast to the northwest. T.J. Meenach Drive, Northwest Boulevard, Ash Street and Wellesley Avenue are all classified by the city as principal arterials. Alberta Street, Driscoll Boulevard and Garland Avenue are classified as minor arterials. Downriver Drive and the Aubrey L. White Parkway, which wind along the river, are classified as major collectors, as are A and Belt Streets, while G Street is a minor collector. All other streets are considered local access roads. There are dedicated bike lanes running along Northwest and Driscoll Boulevards. Belt, A and G Streets carry shared roadway bike routes. AudubonDownriver is served by the Spokane Transit Authority, like the rest of the Spokane metropolitan area, with three fixed-route bus lines passing through the neighborhood.",Normal
"Tick, Tick, Tick, stylized as ...tick...tick...tick..., is a 1970 American crime drama film directed by Ralph Nelson. It was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Racially provocative for its time, it stars Jim Brown in the role of an African American man elected as the sheriff of a rural county in the American South. It has become something of a cult classic for its cutting-edge portrayal of racial relations and its tense narrative. In a small Southern town, a black man, Jim Price is elected sheriff over John Little, the white incumbent. Racial tensions exist in the community, and Price gets little assistance from Little, who is leaving office, or from Mayor Parks, who insists he be consulted on any decision the new sheriff makes. A white man, John Braddock, is arrested on a manslaughter charge after his drunken driving causes the death of a young girl. Braddock's father carries considerable influence and demands his son be freed. Price's deputy, Bradford Wilkes, is beaten by Little's former deputy, Bengy Springer. Another arrest is made, this time of a black man, George Harley, accused of rape. The townspeople's mood turns uglier by the minute, particularly when Braddock's father threatens to spring his son by force if necessary. Little's conscience gets the better of him. He agrees to become Price's new deputy. Together, they try in vain to persuade other men in town to side with them against Braddock's vigilantes and to convince the mayor to call in the National Guard for help. Alone against the mob, Price and Little form a barricade and prepare for the worst when their fellow townsmen suddenly join them in the street. Screenwriter and producer James Lee Barrett also created the television adaptation of In the Heat of the Night. The film's lead was played by Jim Brown, who had recently retired as a professional football player. Brown and George Kennedy had previously appeared together in the war film The Dirty Dozen. Another co-star, Bernie Casey, had played in the National Football League from 1961 to 1968, his career intersecting with that of Brown, who was an NFL star from 1957 to 1965. It was the penultimate film appearance of screen legend Fredric March. It was made in and around Colusa, California. The town's central courthouse square was remodeled to appear like those found in the American South. The same courthouse was also used for exterior shots in the 1962 classic To Kill a Mockingbird. The film was released theatrically in the United States by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in January 1970, the same year as Nelson's Soldier Blue. It was shown in an anamorphic 2.40:1 aspect ratio. A radio advertisement for the film summarized the story simply: ""tick...tick...tick is the sound of time...running out."" The film was never given an official VHS release in the United States. It was released on DVD in 2012 via the Warner Archive on-demand service.",Normal

"Robert Lee Howsam (February 28, 1918 – February 19, 2008) was an American professional sports executive and entrepreneur. In 1959, he played a key role in establishing two leagues—the American Football League, which succeeded and merged with the National Football League, and baseball's Continental League, which never played a game but forced expansion of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 16 to 20 teams in 1961–62. Howsam then became a prominent MLB executive as the highly successful general manager (GM) and club president of the Cincinnati Reds during the Big Red Machine dynasty between 1967 and 1977, when his team won four National League pennants and two World Series titles. He also served as GM of the St. Louis Cardinals from August 17, 1964, until January 1967, where he inherited a team that would win the 1964 World Series, but made material contributions to the Redbirds' 1967 world champions and 1968 pennant-winners. Born in Denver, Howsam attended the University of Colorado and served as a U.S. Navy pilot during World War II. He was the son-in-law of Edwin C. Johnson, a three-term United States Senator and two-term governor of Colorado. Johnson also was involved with professional baseball as founder and first president of the postwar Class A Western League, an upper-level minor league that played from 1947 to 1958. Howsam first made a name for himself as a highly successful baseball executive. He led the family-owned Denver Bears of the Western League and Triple-A American Association from 1947 to 1962. He built one of the most successful minor league franchises of the 1950s and was twice (1951 and 1956) named Minor League Executive of the Year by The Sporting News. Howsam, his brother Earl and his father Lee also built Bears Stadium, a minor league baseball park which, after renovation and expanded capacity, became famous as Mile High Stadium, the Denver Broncos' noisy, raucous and perpetually sold-out home from 1960 to 2001. While the Bears achieved great success as the top farm team of the New York Yankees in the late 1950s, an earlier stint as a mid-level affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates (1952–54) served to introduce Howsam to Pirates' general manager Branch Rickey, the Baseball Hall of Fame executive, who had revolutionized baseball in his earlier career with the St. Louis Cardinals and Brooklyn Dodgers. Rickey would play an influential role later in Howsam's career. In an attempt to bring Major League Baseball to Denver, Howsam was one of the founders of the Continental League, which in 1959 planned to become the ""third Major League"" following the epidemic of franchise shifts during the 1950s. MLB magnates, nervous about the possible rescinding of baseball's antitrust exemption by the U.S. Congress after the National League abandoned New York City in 1958, agreed to study (and perhaps support) the formation of the new loop. Howsam was slated to become owner of the Denver franchise, one of the league's eight charter members. Howsam even went as far as to expand Bears Stadium to over 34,000. Rickey, meanwhile, was elected president of the new circuit. As events unfolded, the new league never got off the drawing board; it was doomed once three of its key cities gained Major League franchises in 1961 and 1962: New York and Houston were awarded expansion National League franchises in 1962, while the Washington Senators of the American League moved to Minneapolis–Saint Paul as part of the Junior Circuit's 1961 expansion. Howsam was now in a bind. He had taken on a large amount of debt in hopes of bringing the majors to Denver. However, there was little prospect of retiring it in the foreseeable future, as he was now saddled with a stadium far too big for a Triple-A team. He concluded the only way to get additional revenue was to extend his stadium's season by bringing in a football team. Howsam first sought an expansion NFL team for Denver. When that bid was turned down, Howsam met with Lamar Hunt in the lobby of The Brown Palace Hotel and founded the Denver Broncos—one of the eight charter members of the American Football League. (Howsam and the seven other original owners called themselves the ""Foolish Club"" for daring to take on the established NFL.) The Broncos played in the AFL from 1960 to 1969 and then joined the NFL with completion of the NFLAFL merger in 1970. After a disastrous 4–9–1 season in 1960, the Howsams sold controlling interest in the Broncos and Bears to Gerald and Alan Phipps in May 1961. The team would only get as high as .500 only three times its first 17 years, including when it joined the NFL in 1970. But it was developing a loyal fan base, and since its first Super Bowl appearance in 1977, the Broncos have become one of the most successful operations in the NFL. After selling the Broncos, Howsam returned to baseball. In the wake of the Continental League's demise, Rickey, then 80, rejoined the Cardinals in 1962 as a part-time but influential advisor to the Redbirds' owner, August A. Busch Jr. In mid-August 1964, with the Cardinals seemingly about to finish well behind the first-place Philadelphia Phillies, Busch fired general manager Bing Devine and replaced him with Howsam—reputedly at Rickey's urging. On August 17, the day of Howsam's hiring, St. Louis was in fifth place at 63–55 in the ten-team National League, nine games behind Philadelphia. However, the team Howsam inherited ended up winning 30 of its last 44 games—including eight in a row from September 24–30—and captured the NL pennant on the last day of the season, as the Phils collapsed. Then, behind Bob Gibson, they defeated the Yankees in the World Series. During the victory celebration after the clinching seventh game, Howsam was given credit for the St. Louis turnaround. This rankled several of the players, most of whom felt Devine's acquisition of Lou Brock in June provided the final piece of the puzzle. Furthermore, Howsam did not have an opportunity to make major changes to the team in his six weeks as general manager; his tenure began two months after the June 15 trade deadline then in effect and the Cardinals' 25-man roster remained virtually the same from August 17 through the World Series. Howsam's two full years as Cardinals' general manager (1965–66) failed to deliver a pennant, with St. Louis winning 80 and 83 games, respectively. Howsam installed popular Red Schoendienst as manager and he rebuilt the Redbirds infield, trading away veterans Ken Boyer, Bill White and Dick Groat in a bid for more pitching help. In 1966, Howsam acquired future Hall of Fame first baseman Orlando Cepeda from the San Francisco Giants on May 8 and right fielder Roger Maris from the Yankees on December 8 during the winter interleague trading period. As the long-term replacement for Boyer, Howsam and Schoendienst decided to stay in house and move Cardinal right fielder Mike Shannon to third base. With Howsam's contributions, the Cardinals were poised to win back-to-back pennants in 1967–68. But in December 1966, a 13-member local ownership syndicate led by Francis L. Dale purchased the Cincinnati Reds; one month later, in January 1967, Howsam accepted its offer to become the club's new general manager. In Cincinnati, Howsam flourished. During his 11 years (1967–77) as general manager, he was one of the key figures (along with his predecessor, Bill DeWitt, and his manager, Sparky Anderson) behind ""The Big Red Machine"", which captured six division titles from 1970 to 1979, four NLCS titles, and two World Series championships in 1975 and 1976. Although many key parts of the Reds' dynasty—such as Pete Rose, Johnny Bench, Tony Pérez, Lee May and Tommy Helms—were already in place or in the organization in 1966, Howsam boldly promoted young pitchers such as Gary Nolan, Don Gullett and Wayne Simpson to the Major Leagues. In 1970, he replaced a popular incumbent manager, Dave Bristol, with a then-unproven but a future Hall-of-Fame skipper in Anderson, whom Howsam had earlier hired as a manager in the Cardinals' and Reds' farm systems. He ensured that the fruitful Cincinnati system continued to churn out young position players, such as Dave Concepción, Ken Griffey, Ray Knight and Bernie Carbo. He also acquired record-setting reliever Wayne Granger and two talented young outfielders, Bobby Tolan and Alex Johnson, from the Cardinals. It was the second time that Howsam had traded for Johnson (the first was in 1965 while Johnson was a member of the Philadelphia Phillies), and he would ultimately trade Johnson away for pitchers Pedro Borbon and Jim McGlothlin (who would go on to win 14 games for the 1970 Reds). Then, in two masterful 1971 trades, Howsam acquired second baseman Joe Morgan (in a deal that included May and Helms) from the Houston Astros and outfielder George Foster from the Giants (for utility infielder Frank Duffy). In Cincinnati, Morgan would win consecutive NL Most Valuable Player awards in 1975–76 and earn credentials as a member of the Hall of Fame. Foster won the 1977 NL MVP award when he belted 52 home runs for the Reds — the only player to crack the half-century HR mark in the 1970s or 1980s. The 1976 Cincinnati club, which won 102 regular season games, then swept both the Phillies in the 1976 National League Championship Series and the Yankees in the 1976 World Series, is considered one of the strongest in baseball history. The Sporting News named Howsam Major League Executive of the Year for 1973; ironically, that season the powerhouse Reds dropped the NLCS to the underdog New York Mets. Howsam reportedly had considerably more authority than most general managers of the time. The team's owners during his tenure (first Dale, then Louis Nippert) largely left the team's day-to-day operations in his hands, and he added the title of team president in 1973. He even represented the Reds at owners' meetings. Under his watch, the Reds were known for their strict policies on player appearance. Players were not allowed to have facial hair (a policy that continued long after Howsam left the team) and were required to wear their uniform pants and socks in a specific fashion. However, Howsam was especially known for his conservatism regarding labor relations; under him, the Reds were among the hardliners during the 1972 strike. The advent of free agency came upon baseball right after the 1976 title. As such, with the looming question of who to let go to free agency at first base among 34-year-old veteran Tony Pérez or 26-year-old Dan Driessen, Howsam chose to trade Perez to the Montreal Expos, with him and Will McEnaney going to the Montreal Expos for in exchange for veteran pitcher Woody Fryman and reliever Dale Murray. Many players, along with Anderson and Howsam himself, believed that the loss of Perez in the clubhouse played a key factor in the decline of the team in the following years.  Don Gullett left the Reds after the 1976 season and signed with the Yankees. The 1977 Reds finished second in the NL West to the Los Angeles Dodgers (a team that finished in second in the division six times in the past seven years), despite Howsam engineering a big mid-season trade for future Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Seaver. Approaching his 60th birthday at the close of the 1977 season, Howsam turned over his general manager responsibilities to a longtime assistant, Dick Wagner, who was described as Howsam's ""hatchet man"". The Reds finished second to the Dodgers again in 1978 and Rose left via free agency in the winter of 1978. Wagner fired Sparky Anderson after the 1978 season after Anderson refused to fire key members of his coaching staff. Joe Morgan left in 1979. Howsam returned to the club presidency in 1983 replacing a fired Wagner. By then, the Reds were in last place of the NL West. Howsam traded for an aging Pete Rose in 1984 and installed him as a player-manager. Rose would become the all-time hits leader the next year, collecting hit No. 4,192 on Sept. 11, 1985, eclipsing a record set by the immortal Ty Cobb. Howsam was elected to the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 2004. In retirement, Howsam served on the Colorado Baseball Commission, which succeeded in bringing the Colorado Rockies to Denver as a National League expansion team in 1993 — thus fulfilling his dream of bringing MLB to his hometown three decades after the death of the Continental League. He had been elected to his home state's Sports Hall of Fame in 1971. He died from complications of heart disease on February 19, 2008, nine days short of his 90th birthday, at his Sun City, Arizona, home.",Normal
"Osiris and Isis (German: Osiris und Isis) is a painting made by the German artist Anselm Kiefer in 1985–1987. It shows an Egyptian mastaba and incorporates a circuit board, copper wires and porcelain shards. Through its title, it evokes the Osiris myth. Critics have discussed its treatment of history, meaningfulness and matter, and possible connections to Christianity and Gnosticism. The painting is in the collection of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The picture of Osiris and Isis is filled by a mastaba, a type of ancient Egyptian tomb which was a precursor to the Egyptian pyramids. Above the building is an electronic circuit board from which 14 copper wires hang. At the end of each wire is a shard of porcelain. The title evokes the Osiris myth, in which the dismembered Egyptian god Osiris is reassambled by his sister-wife Isis. The myth was used in ancient Egypt as an origin story for the Pharaonic dynasties, who were said to descend from Osiris and Isis. The German artist Anselm Kiefer says he became interested in the myth through his interest in correspondences between spiritual power and technology. He says both the story of Osiris and the story of nuclear power are about regeneration, and he stresses how Isis in the myth is unable to find Osiris' penis, arguing that a nuclear reactor is ""a kind of penis"". Kiefer made Osiris and Isis in 1985–1987. It has the surface dimensions of 379.73 by 561.34 centimetres (149.50in ×221.00in) and a depth of 24.13 centimetres (9.50in). It was painted in oil and acrylic emulsion, with a real circuit board, copper wires and pieces of a porcelain sink attached. Kay Larson of New York likens Osiris and Isis to the works of Kiefer's former mentor Joseph Beuys, but says Kiefer elaborates Beuys' way of working by infusing painting with ""history, narrative, mystery, and myth"", and succeeds at ""creating the possibility of a dark redemption in the midst of violent times"". David A. Siedell writes in Image that although the painting depicts a physical building and has been interpreted in relation to the Chernobyl disaster, it differs from Kiefer's more historical paintings such as Shulamite (1983) and Ash Flower (1983–1997) because of its ""disembodied mythic register"". The scholar Frank Burch Brown discusses Osiris and Isis in the context of Christian culture, where evocations of otherworldly transcendence are preferred to corporal and temporal themes. He says Osiris and Isis portrays ""the charred remnants of sacred and political power"", beyond ""restoration or demolition"", evoking a world with ""nothing inherently holy and abiding, and nonetheless something More is signalled by what is taken to be only a sign and neither presence nor geuine mediator"". Donald Kuspit writes in Artforum that Osiris and Isis is ""extraordinarily ambitious"" in its attempt to address issues of meaningfulness, art, nuclear fission, creation, destruction, matter and the body. He likens the way it presents history and the world to themes present in Gnosticism, writing that just like ""the Gnostics believed that matter is evil and that salvation comes through spiritual truth,  works suggest that all body is 'unregenerate' substance that must be regenerated through art"". Osiris and Isis was exhibited at the Marian Goodman Gallery in New York in May 1987. It hung opposite another large Kiefer painting, Burning Rods (German: Brennstäbe), which depicts what presumably are control rods from a nuclear reactor. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art purchased Osiris and Isis in 1987. The purchase was made possible through an exchange with Jean Stein and support from the Mrs. Paul L. Wattis Fund and the Doris and Donald Fisher Fund. As of 2023, it was not on display.",Normal

"Tanagra (Greek: Τανάγρα) is a town and a municipality north of Athens in Boeotia, Greece. The seat of the municipality is the town Schimatari. It is not far from Thebes, and it was noted in antiquity for the figurines named after it. The Tanagra figurines were a mass-produced, mold-cast and fired type of Greek terracotta figurine produced from the later fourth century BC, primarily in Tanagra. The municipality Tanagra was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 4 former municipalities, that became municipal units: Anciently, Tanagra (Ancient Greek: Τάναγρα), sometimes written Tanagraea, was a town of ancient Boeotia, situated upon the left bank of the Asopus, in a fertile plain, at the distance of 130 stadia from Oropus and 200 from Plataeae. Several ancient writers identified Tanagra with the Homeric Graea; but others supposed them to be distinct places, and Aristotle regarded Oropus as the ancient Graea. Pausanias mentions in Tanagra's location the ancient city of Graea, eponymous of the Graikoi, a Boeotian tribe whose name gave rise to the Latin Graecus ""Greek"" which later spread throughout the western world as the name of the Greeks and Greece. Homer, while reciting the Boeotian forces in the Iliad's Catalogue of Ships, provides the first known reference to the Boeotian city of Graea. Tanagra was also called Poemandria or Poimandria (Ποιμανδρία), and its territory Poemandris, from the fertile meadows which surrounded the city, or after its founder Poimandros, who took part in the Trojan campaign. The most ancient inhabitants of Tanagra are said to have been the Gephyraei, who came from Phoenicia with Cadmus, and from thence emigrated to Athens. From its vicinity to Attica the territory of Tanagra was the scene of more than one battle. In 457BC the Lacedaemonians on their return from an expedition to Doris, took up a position at Tanagra, near the borders of Attica, with the view of assisting the oligarchical party at Athens to overthrow the democracy. The Athenians, with a thousand Argeians and some Thessalian horse, crossed Mount Parnes and advanced, against the Lacedaemonians. In the First Battle of Tanagra, both sides fought with great bravery; but the Lacedaemonians gained the victory, chiefly through the treacherous desertion of the Thessalians in the very heat of the engagement. At the beginning of the following year (456BC), and only sixty-two days after their defeat at Tanagra, the Athenians under Myronides again invaded Boeotia, and gained at Oenophyta, in the territory of Tanagra, a brilliant and decisive victory over the Boeotian League, which made them masters of the whole country (see Battle of Oenophyta). The walls of Tanagra were now razed to the ground. The Second Battle of Tanagra was fought in 426BC. the Athenians made an incursion into the territory of Tanagra, and on their return defeated the Tanagraeans and Boeotians. Dicaearchus, who visited Tanagra in the time of Cassander, says that the city stood on a rugged and lofty height, and had a white chalky appearance. The houses are adorned with handsome porticoes and encaustic paintings. The surrounding country does not grow much corn, but produces the best wine in Boeotia. Dicaearchus adds that the inhabitants are wealthy but frugal, being for the most part landholders, not manufacturers; and he praises them for their justice, good faith, and hospitality. In the time of Augustus, Tanagra and Thespiae were the two most prosperous cities in Boeotia. Tanagra is called by Pliny the Elder a free state; it is mentioned by Ptolemy; and it continued to flourish in the sixth century. Its public buildings are described at some length by Pausanias. The principal temple was that of Dionysus, which contained a celebrated statue of Parian marble, by Calamis, and a remarkable Triton. Near it were temples of Themis, Aphrodite and Apollo, and two of Hermes, in one of which he was worshipped as Criophorus, and in the other as Promachus. Near the latter was the theatre, and probably at no great distance the gymnasium, which contained a picture of Corinna, who was a native of Tanagra. There was also a monument of this poet in a conspicuous part of the city. Pausanias remarks as a peculiarity in Tanagra, that all their sacred buildings were placed by themselves, apart from the houses of the town. He likewise notices that Tanagra was famous for its breed of fighting-cocks, a circumstance which is mentioned by other writers. Tanagra possessed a considerable territory; and Strabo mentions four villages belonging to it, Eleon or Heleon, Harma, Mycalessus, and Pharae. The ruins of the ancient city are located at approximately: 38°18′23″N 23°35′09″E﻿ ﻿38.306389°N 23.585833°E﻿ 38.306389; 23.585833. In the early 1870s, a spate of looting at Tanagra's necropolis saw the theft of artefacts, including figurines, from around 10,000 tombs. This episode raised the profile of the illegal excavation and export of antiquities among the Greek press and public, and led to the excavation of the site by Panagiotis Stamatakis between 1871 and 1873. In the early 2000s, a military plane which was on a training flight crashed on the runway during bad weather. There were no survivors. On Sunday 18 September 2005, the Archangelos air show, the largest ever organized in Greece, took place in Tanagra. It attracted a crowd of more than 200,000. The municipality has an area of 461.023km2, the municipal unit 122.527km2, the community 27.814km2. Tanagra is located SE of Thiva and Arma, SW of Schimatari and NW of Agios Thomas. Farmlands surround the rest of Tanagra, and the Asopus River along with the Parnitha mountains to the south. Arvanites settled in Tanagra in the Middle Ages, but today they only make up a linguistic minority. Since 1956, the 114th Combat Wing of the Hellenic Air Force has been based in Tanagra Air Base. The base is one of Greece's largest military airports and its runway is about 3km in length. In the area it is located also the Hellenic Aerospace Industry. Tanagra can be accessed by GR-1 in the north and by a provincial road linking Thiva (Thebes) in the west. Tanagra is served by two interchanges, a partial southbound exit, a northbound entrance to the northwest and an almost-full to the east, serving access to highways 44 and 77 to the island of Euboea. Its service road lies to the south and is linked with the southeast bypass and to the military base. This articleincorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:Smith, William, ed.

"Pershore is a market town and civil parish in the Wychavon district in Worcestershire, England, on the banks of the River Avon. At the 2011 census, the population was 7,125. The town is best known for Pershore Abbey. Pershore is situated 6 miles (10km) west of Evesham and 6 miles (10km) east of Upton-upon-Severn in the Vale of Evesham. The town contains examples of Georgian architecture. In 1964 the Council for British Archaeology included Pershore in its list of 51 British ""Gem Towns"" worthy of special consideration for historic preservation, and it has been listed as an outstanding conservation area. Parts of the abbey, which stand in an expanse of public grassland close to the centre of the town, date from the 11th century. The current structure is far smaller than the original building, which was plundered during the reign of Henry VIII at the Dissolution. The original nave was destroyed. The north transept collapsed later. The present nave occupies the western part of what would originally have been the choir. Schools in Pershore follow the three-tier first school (ages 5–9), middle school (ages 9–12), high school (ages 11–18) system practised by parts of Worcestershire County Council. Pershore High School has a sixth form with all-weather sports pitches and sports hall. Abbey Park First School and Abbey Park Middle School are on Abbey Road, they are both situated down the same drive. Pershore High School is on Station Road, which is on the outskirts of Pershore, bordering Pinvin, a small village. Holy Redeemer Roman Catholic Primary School, situated on Priest Lane beside Holy Redeemer, Pershore's only Catholic church, stands outside the 3-tier model. It is a primary school (ages 5–11) which acts as a feeder school to Blessed Edward Oldcorne Catholic College in Worcester. Pershore College, a school of horticulture and other land-based activities, became a campus for Warwickshire College (now WCG) following a merger in 2007. The Pershore Plum Festival is held in August to celebrate the local tradition of growing plums including the local varieties Pershore Purple, Pershore Yellow Egg Plum and Pershore Emblem. Activities include crowning the plum princess, a family fun run, plum themed art exhibition and the Plum Fayre. There is also a classic car rally and nearby Worcester Racecourse revived The Land O'Plums Chase from 72 years ago. The festival won the Best Tourism Event and Festival in the Worcestershire Welcome Awards 2011. Pershore Bowling Club is situated within Abbey Park; formed in 1928 following an invitation by the then Lord Abbott of Pershore to the tradesmen of the town to play bowls on the lawn at the monastery, long since demolished. The Lord Abbott accepted an invitation to be the Club’s first President and continued to hold this office until 1936 when the monastery was closed and the monks moved to Nashdom Abbey in Buckinghamshire. Pershore's football club, Pershore Town F.C., play in the West Midlands (Regional) League Premier Division. It also has a women's team, Pershore Town Ladies, who play in the new Herefordshire and Worcestershire Women's County Football League. Pershore Sports club, which houses Pershore Cricket Club who play in the Birmingham and District League, is situated at The Bottoms on Defford Road. Pershore Rugby Club has a clubhouse and pitches by the river in nearby Wyre Piddle. Pershore Tennis Club, based at the Horticultural College, has three indoor and five outdoor courts, with junior, social and adult sections. Multiple BTCC title winning team, Team Dynamics, is also based there. Wychavon Kayak & Canoe Club  is situated on the river at Pershore Riverside Centre. Pershore Plum Plodders is an England Athletics affiliated running club serving Pershore and the surrounding villages. The Abbey Park includes a bowls club, children's play area and skateboard park (2006), consisting of a mini ramp and a street section. Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals can be received from either the Sutton Coldfield or Lark Stoke TV transmitters.  Local radio stations are BBC Hereford and Worcester, Heart West Midlands, Radio Wyvern, Capital Mid-Counties, Greatest Hits Radio Herefordshire & Worcestershire, Free Radio Herefordshire & Worcestershire, and Smooth West Midlands. The town is served by the local newspaper, Evesham Journal  and its own community based newspaper, The Pershore Times.  The town lies near the A44, approximately midway between Worcester and Evesham. The nearest motorways are the M5 and M50. Pershore railway station is located in the village of Pinvin. It lies on the Cotswold Line which enables travel to London Paddington, Oxford and Reading. About 0.5 miles (0.8km) outside the town is Pershore Old Bridge over the River Avon. A bridge was originally built on the site, in about 1413, by monks, supposedly after their abbot, Upton, was drowned falling from stepping-stones. The scene is included in the historical window installed in 1862–64 in Pershore Abbey. In 1644, during the English Civil War, a later bridge was damaged and almost destroyed. In subsequent years the bridge was maintained by re-using stones from nearby Elmley Castle and from the abbey. In 1926 the bridge was taken out of service for road traffic and is now used only as a footbridge.

"Jaime Yankelevich (13 March 1896 – 25 February 1952) was an Argentine engineer and businessman who was a pioneer in the development of his country's radio and television media. Jaime Yankelevich was born into a Jewish family in Bulgaria, in 1896. His parents emigrated to Argentina in 1899 and settled in the province of Entre Ríos. The Yankelevich family relocated to Buenos Aires in 1914, where Jaime found work in one of the city's many theatres as a backstage hand. Trained as a theatre electrician, Yankelevich eventually opened an electrical supply store in the Constitución section of Buenos Aires. The store specialized in radio valves and other equipment, which became in great demand following the advent of the medium in 1920. Increasingly skilled in his field, he created many of these parts by hand. The sale of a failing early radio station gave Yankelevich the opportunity to pursue his interest directly and in 1924, he purchased the ailing broadcaster. Known at the time as ""LR3"" (for its being the third station on the dial), Yankelevich pioneered the use of artistic contracts in radio, by which artists were paid a salary in return for his commitment to limit broadcasts of their work to live performances in lieu of recordings. The practice made the newly christened ""Radio Belgrano"" the most coveted employer in Argentine radio and by the 1930s, it enjoyed the nation's highest ratings. Growing acquisitions allowed Yankelevich to form the Radio Belgrano chain in 1937. Venturing into other areas, he co-produced Two Friends and One Love, a 1937 romantic comedy film, with Francisco Canaro, a well-known Argentine tango bandleader. Later that decade, he pioneered late-night broadcasting in Argentina, and in 1942, united numerous low-wattage radio stations into the Argentine Broadcasting Chain, which preserved or reopened a number of smaller, local stations nationwide. The 1946 election of President Juan Perón resulted in the nationalization of industries producing nearly half the nation's goods and services, including the three radio networks that controlled most of Argentina's stations, El Mundo, Splendid and Belgrano. Yankelevich had opposed the 1943 coup d'état, and the advent of one of its most recognizable figures (Perón) to the Presidency antagonized the impresario. Allowing critical commentary of Perón's inaugural address following the event, Radio Belgrano was suspended by government order for one month. The experience persuaded Yankelevich to sell Radio Belgrano to the state for US$1.5 million in 1947. The chain's management was left to Yankelevich, who continued to receive the greater part of the chain's net income (Argentine radio's most profitable), and in turn, the Perón regime dictated content and vetted personnel and performers. A personal tragedy motivated Yankelevich to pioneer another, then-inexistent medium in Argentina. The death in 1949 of his son Miguel, who professed fascination with the growth of television in the United States, led the grieving father to purchase the necessary equipment for its introduction in Argentina. Discussing the authorization for the project with Perón's Communications Minister, Oscar Nicolini, Yankelevich persuaded the reluctant bureaucrat by positing that: The money needed to invest in this project does not concern me, for no amount of millions would be too much!  Importing DuMont television cameras and ITT transmitters, he and engineers James Ballantine, Máximo Koeble and Alejandro Spataro prepared the downtown studio and installed a 50 meters (160 feet) antenna over the 23-story Ministry of Public Works (then Buenos Aires' second-tallest building). Personally operating the antenna, Yankelevich and his team achieved the nation's first television broadcast in 1951, reaching 40 blocks around. Emitting programs through the only TV station in Argentina at the time (Channel 7), all programming on the station was produced by Radio Belgrano Televisión, providing Yankelevich a similarly profitable relationship with the state as the one his radio chain had enjoyed since 1947. Yankelevich's failing health led to his hospitalization a few months later, and he died in 1952 at the age of 56. Among the items in his hospital room, was a television set.",Normal

"A shtick is a comic theme or gimmick. The word entered the English language from the Yiddish shtik (שטיק), related to German Stück, Polish sztuka, Cyrillic штука (all ultimately from Proto-Germanic *stukkiją), all meaning ""piece"", ""thing"" or ""theatre play""; Theaterstück is the German word for play (and is a synonym of Schauspiel, literally ""viewing play"" in contrast to Singspiel). The English word piece is sometimes used in a similar context (for example, a musical piece). In stand-up comedy context a near equivalent term is a ""bit"". Another variant is ""bits of business"" or just ""bits"". Shtick may refer to an adopted persona, usually for comedy performances, that is maintained consistently (though not necessarily exclusively) across the performer's career. In this usage, the recurring personalities adopted by Laurel and Hardy through all of their many comedy films (although they often played characters with different names and occupations) would qualify as their shtick. A comedian might maintain several different shticks of this sort, particularly if appearing in a variety show encouraging development of multiple characters, such as Saturday Night Live. In common usage, the word shtick has also come to mean any talent, style, habit, or other eccentricity for which a person is particularly well known, even if not intended for comedic purposes. For example, a person who is known locally for an ability to eat dozens of hot dogs quickly might say that it was his shtick. Among Orthodox Jews, ""shtick"" can also refer to wedding shtick, in which wedding guests entertain the bride and groom through dancing, costumes, juggling, and silliness. Many fictional characters have more thematic shticks. This is particularly true of comic book villains, who are almost always seen wearing a particular costume and behaving in ways that are consistent with a bizarre and psychotic obsession. The supervillains of Batman (collectively known as the Rogues Gallery) are especially notorious for this (see below). There are also many professional wrestlers who deliver memorable catchphrases, andor enter arenas performing signature gestures to the tune of thematically appropriate songs, causing crowds to laugh and cheer (see below). Because of its roots in show business, shtick has taken on the connotation of a contrived and often-used act. For this reason, journalists and commentators often apply the word disparagingly to stock replies from politicians. Tojo Yamamoto (real name Harold Watanabe, who was Japanese-American) played to American awareness of the Pacific Theater of World War II. Tojo was a Japanese general, and Yamamoto was the Japanese admiral who oversaw the attack on Pearl Harbor. Tojo Yamamoto wore a kimono to the ring, and often would use wooden shoes to strike opponents.",Normal
"San Bartolo Coyotepec is a town and municipality located in the center of the Mexican state of Oaxaca. It is in the Centro District of the Valles Centrales region about fifteen km south of the capital of Oaxaca. The town is best known for its Barro negro pottery - black clay pottery. For hundreds of years pottery has been made here with a gray matte finish, but in the 1950s a technique was devised to give the pieces a shiny black finish without painting. This has made the pottery far more popular and collectable. The town is home to the Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca (State Museum of Popular Art of Oaxaca) which was opened here in 2004, with a large portion of its collection consisting of barro negro pottery. There is also a barro negro mural on the recently opened Baseball Academy. The area was the settled homeland of the ancient Mesoamerican Zapotec civilization going back at least 2500 years, with the oldest archeological finds being in the Valley of Oaxaca. Its Zapotec language name is Zaapeche, place of many jaguars (Panthera onca). In 1521, the area became an encomiendo under Bartolomé Sánchez who named the settlement, San Jacinto Leontepec. Later, this was changed to the current name. San Bartolo refers to the patron saint, Bartholomew and Coyotepec is from Nahuatl meaning ""hill of coyotes"". Zaachila Zapotec is spoken in the town. San Bartolo is a Zapotec community, which has been making pottery for about 2,000 years. The clay of this area produces a distinctive color, which for most of San Bartolo's history was a Grey matte. This clay has been used to produce utilitarian objects such as jars, dishes and other storage containers. The techniques for making the pottery have changed little during these centuries, with plates serving as potters’ wheels and design remaining traditional. One change has been the replacement of underground pits by kilns for firing the pieces. However, the most important innovation has been a polishing method devised by ceramic artist and potter Doña Rosa in the 1950s. Doña Rosa discovered that by polishing the nearly dry clay before firing, the gray color turned to a shiny black. This has made the pottery far more popular, and many pieces are produced now for decorative purposes rather than utilitarian. Since then, the aesthetic qualities of ""barro negro"" (black clay) pottery has become further appreciated due to the work of artisan-sculpture Carlomagno Pedro Martinez, who has displayed his barro negro work nationally and internationally. The end of the Pre-Columbian era arrived with Spanish conquest and occupation of the Zapotec peoples region in 1521. It was first renamed 'San Jacinto Leóntepec,' It then changed again to 'San Bartolomé Coyotepec,' by Bartolomé Sanchez, a soldier of Hernán Cortés awarded a local Encomienda. The first church was built in 1532. From its Spanish foundation was one of the larger settlements with three neighborhoods. This settlement was laid out by the same architect that designed the city of Oaxaca. Vicente Guerrero passed through here after he was taken prisoner, and Porfirio Díaz hid here during the French Intervention in Mexico. The center of the town is similar to that of the city of Oaxaca, with a main plaza, parish church and municipal palace. The eastern side of the main plaza is dominated by a ceiba tree. In the tianguis or other markets, one can find regional dishes such as mole negro, mole coloradito, cequeza, higaditos and stews made from chicken or turkey. There are some pre-Hispanic remains of buildings which were ceremonial centers or houses for the ruling class. The rest of the town is divided into three neighborhoods called ""centro"" or ""San Bartolo"", ""San Mateo"" and in the north ""Santa María"". Very near there are two other communities called Animas Trujano and San Juan Bautistas la Raya founded around the same time as San Bartolo Coyotepec, but they are not considered part of the town proper. Next to the town is the hill called Zaapech or Jaguar Mountain which has always been considered sacred. One of the major festivals here is Candlemas. The patron saint, Bartholomew the Apostle is feasted in August. During festivals such as these, local traditional dances such as De la Pluma and De los Jardineros Moros y Cristianos can be seen. Both date from the Spanish Conquest. However two of the main attractions for the town are Mercado Artesanal (Crafts Market) filled mostly with barro negro pottery and the Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca (State Museum of Popular Art of Oaxaca). The Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca - MEAPO, the State Museum of Popular Art of Oaxaca, was founded in 2004 to promote and preserve the traditional crafts of this state. The museum was designed by and is cared for by a commission of craftsmen from San Bartolo Coyotepec. The museum sponsors events such as the ""Tianguis artisanal"", a crafts flea market, along with other civic groups. The museum's roots extend to 1905, when local resident Manuel Guzmán donated land for the establishment of a cultural center. The site was used first as a municipal library and then as a primary school. However, it was not until 1994 when a group of youths worked to build a museum that would be dedicated to barro negro pottery. That same year, the state government allocated 25,000 pesos to rehabilitate the building on the site, and local artist Carlomagno Pedro Martinez raised 80,000 pesos to install modern equipment. In 1996, the museum was founded as the community museum, with its initial collection. In that year, it sponsored, along with ARIPO - Artesanías e Industrias Populares del estado de Oaxaca, the first crafts competition. The museum struggled for a while financially until it signed a cooperation agreement with the 'Instituto Oaxaqueño de las Culturas,' the Oaxaca Institute of Cultures, which required a restructuring of the museum. In 2002, the community museum closed with the aim of building the current one. In 2004, the current museum opened with the aim of presenting the crafts history of the entire state of Oaxaca, Mexico. The museum has held temporary exhibits such as ""Mujeres tejiendo historias"" (Women knitting stories), ""Grandes Maestros del Arte Popular de Oaxaca"" (Grand Masters of Popular Art in Oaxaca) and ""Historia y evolución del barro negro"" (History and evolution of barro negro pottery). The new museum opened with new furniture and designed to international standards. The idea is to create a collection of popular art that represents the eight regions of the state of Oaxaca. The mission is to promote Oaxacan handcrafts and popular art to the state's, Mexican, and international communities, as well as foster exchanges among artisans and promote tourism based on crafts. This includes the weaving and textile arts in Oaxacan traditions. The museum was built here to decentrale state cultural institutions. The museum offers guided tours in Spanish and English, workshops for adults and children, and spaces to rent for events. For almost all of the town's history, the color of the local pottery was a dull dark gray, until Doña Rosa Real discovered a way to create a shiny black finish commonly known as barro negro pottery. The innovation made the pottery more popular and famous, with Nelson Rockefeller having a collection of her pieces. Doña Rosa died in 1980, but the tradition of making the barro negro pottery is being carried on by Doña Rosa's daughter and grandchildren who stage demonstrations for tourists. The workshop is still in the family home, where shelves and shelves of shiny black pieces for sale line the inner courtyard. Despite being the origin of black polished clay, the pieces at the Doña Rosa Workshop are less expensive than in other parts of Mexico. Two pottery pieces which are indicative of San Bartolo are the traditional Cantaro, a large jar which can be used for liquid storage or as a musical instrument and the ""chango mezcalero"" or mezcal monkey. This is a clay container in the shape of a monkey to hold mezcal, Oaxaca main distilled spirit, which has become a collectable folk art item. The container can be painted in bright colors or left in its gray color with detailed etching. The small opening at the top is plugged by a stopper of cork or corncob. These bottles are sized to hold about 700 to 1000 milliliters of liquid and were originally meant to serve as decorative containers in bars. Two families claim to have originated this clay bottle. The first is that of Doña Rosa. The family believes that Doña Rosa's husband, Juventino Nieto, invented the design at the request of cantina operators from the city of Oaxaca. Other animal forms were also designed as created as well, but the monkey one gained notoriety. The other family to lay claim to the mezcal monkey is that of Marcelo Simón Galan, now deceased. This family claims that he used to travel with his grey pottery pieces, which included water bottles and jars. Like the Doña Rosa family, this family claims the design was created upon request, with Marcelo doing the potting and others the painting. One of Marcelo's mezcal monkeys is on display at the state crafts museum. Another promoter of barro negro pottery from San Bartolo Coyotepec is Carlomagno Pedro Martinez. He was born here into a pottery-making family. He was named after Charlemagne by his grandmother, who was an admirer of the king. From a young age showed talent in fashioning figures in clay. When he was grown, he attended the Fine Arts Workshop of Rufino Tamayo in Oaxaca city. He has become the first potter-artist-sculptor in the medium, winning his first recognition in 1985 for his work Tlaquepaque, Jalisco. His fame increased with his development of human skulls made of barro negro in the years that followed. In Mexico, he has exhibited his work in dozens of expositions and has won three national level awards. His work has also been featured in five published books. Martinez's work has been exhibited in countries such as the United States, Colombia, Argentina, Lebanon, Germany, Spain, and Japan, with one of the latest exhibits in New York City in 2008. In that same year, he created a mural in barro negro at the Baseball Academy in San Bartolo Coyotepec sponsored by the Alfredo Harp Helú Foundation. Each piece Carlomagno makes is unique in some way, but certain themes such as oral histories, indigenous legends, certain Christian themes and death, called ""our grandmother."" As municipal seat, the town of San Bartolo Coyotepec is the governing authority for the seven other communities: Reyes Mantecón, Cuarta Sección, La Guelavaca (El Tule), El Guapo (San Francisco), La Magdalena, La Soledad, Paraje la Colorada and Paraje la Era. Together these communities cover an area of 45.93km2 and have a total population of just over 8,000 people.(inegi) The municipality borders the municipalities of Santa María Coyotepec, Santa Catarina Quiane, San Martín Tilcajete, Santo Tomás Jalieza, San Juan Teitipac and Villa de Zaachila. The most important elevations are Piedra Redonda, Chivaguia Grande, Chivaguia Chica, Guinise Grande, Loma del Cuche, La Peñas and Guibetes. The Atoyac and Valiente Rivers pass through here. The municipality has a temperate climate with winds mostly from the north. Agriculture employ about 19% of the population growing vegetables such as corn, beans and squash blossom, as well as decorative flowers such as daisies, Mexican marigolds and poinsettias. Orchards here produce oranges, mangos, mamey sapotes, black sapotes, guavas and other tropical fruit. Livestock includes domestic fowl, pigs, cattle and sheep. About 33% are involved in mining and industry, with most of this population dedicated to the making of barro negro pottery. The rest of the population, about 45% is employed in commerce. In 1997, Father Manuel Marinero announced that he was in love with a member of the parish church. The Catholic Church responded by immediately putting an end to Marinero's 24-year career as a priest. However, since then the local community has continued to support him as their spiritual leader. At least as of 2002, the town of San Bartolo Coyotepec has officially been without a priest as Marinero is not recognized. However, the people here still called him ""Padre"" (Father) and he continues to live in the house that has been traditionally reserved for parish priests with his wife and two children. The Church has asked him to move but the house belongs to the town and the residents want him to stay. It is not unknown for Mexican priests to have significant others, but it is kept hidden and numbers are not known. Marinero's case is unusual because it is public. Beginning in 2004, Marinero began to publicly support gay marriage as well In 2009 the Academy of Baseball was founded in San Bartolo Coyotepec by Alfredo Harp Helú. The academy has six instructors and can accommodate sixty students of between fourteen and seventeen years of age. The goal is to prepare young people who hope to have a career in the sport, while supporting the completion of their education. It is the first of its kind in Mexico and the founder hopes that there will be more. The facilities cover more than ten hectares and include a library, computer center, three baseball fields, and living quarters for students. Murals were commissioned for the project including ""El camino del Sol for el cielo"" by José Luis Garcia and a barro negro mural by Carlomagno Pedro called ""Juego en el inframundo"".",Normal

"Fernando Codá dos Santos Cavalcanti Marques (born 8 October 1979) is a Brazilian mathematician working mainly in geometry, topology, partial differential equations and Morse theory. He is a professor at Princeton University. In 2012, together with André Neves, he proved the Willmore conjecture. Fernando Codá Marques was born on 8 October 1979 in São Carlos and grew up in Maceió. His parents were both professors of engineering. Codá Marques started as a student of civil engineering at the Federal University of Alagoas in 1996, but switched to mathematics after two years. He obtained a master's degree from the Instituto Nacional de Matemática Pura e Aplicada (IMPA) in 1999. Among his teachers at the IMPA were Manfredo do Carmo and Elon Lages Lima. Following the advice of Manfredo do Carmo, Codá Marques went to Cornell University to learn geometric analysis from José F. Escobar, so that he could return and bring this area of research to Brazil. While still in Brazil, Codá Marques had been informed that Escobar was facing cancer and that he could maybe die before Codá Marques could complete his Ph.D. with him. Despite this information, Codá Marques decided to keep the arrangement and became his student. In 2001, Codá Marques was awarded Cornell's Battig Prize for graduate students, for ""excellence and promise in mathematics"". He obtained his Ph.D. from Cornell University in 2003, under the supervision of José F. Escobar (thesis: Existence and Compactness Theorems on Conformal Deformation of Metrics). Despite the usual path being to go for a postdoctoral research, Codá Marques had in mind that his mission was to return to Brazil. IMPA had already offered him a position of researcher, and he accepted it. But after six months in Brazil, Escobar, who was his main connection with researchers outside of Brazil, died. Codá Marques faced the difficulties of doing research in isolation, so he decided to accept an invitation to stay one year as a postdoc at Stanford University. There he was influenced by Richard Schoen's school of thought in geometry and met André Neves (who would become his main collaborator), and many other of his contacts. He worked at IMPA from 2003 to 2014. On 1 September 2014, Codá Marques joined Princeton University as a full professor. Antoine Song was a student of his. Some of his best known works are the following: In 2009, together with Richard Schoen and Marcus Khuri he did important work on the Yamabe problem. He solved Schoen's conjecture on compactness in the Yamabe problem for spin manifolds. In April 2010, in cooperation with Simon Brendle and André Neves, Marques provided a counter-example to the rigidity conjecture of Min-Oo. Codá Marques and Neves ""Min-max theory and the Willmore conjecture"" was uploaded to arXiv in February 2012, in it they solved the Willmore conjecture, using Almgren–Pitts min-max theory, which was then ""a relatively old tool and already somewhat out of favor"". According to Harold Rosenberg, using this tool was possible because the pair discovered a connection between objects that were apparently very different: ""connecting the problem with questions about minimal surfaces on the sphere  a priori there would be no reason for these things to be connected. It's curious, very curious."", the solution to the Willmore conjecture (Willmore, 1965) In May 2012, in cooperation with Ian Agol and André Neves, Marques provided the solution to the Freedman–He–Wang conjecture (Freedman–He–Wang, 1994) In December 2017, in cooperation with Kei Irie and André Neves, he solved Yau's conjecture (Yau, 1982) in the generic case. Codá Marques and André Neves are currently working to extend Almgren–Pitts min-max theory. He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) of 2010 in Hyderabad (on ""Scalar curvature, conformal geometry, and the Ricci flow with surgery""), and a plenary speaker at the ICM of 2014 in Seoul (on ""Minimal surfaces – variational theory and applications""). He received the TWAS Prize in 2012. He was awarded the ICTP Ramanujan Prize in 2012, ""in recognition of his several outstanding contributions to differential geometry"". In 2014 he gave the Łojasiewicz Lecture (on ""The min-max theory of minimal surfaces and applications"") at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. He is a full member of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences since 2014. He shared the 2016 Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry with André Neves, ""for their remarkable work on variational problems in differential geometry  the proof of the Willmore conjecture."". He was elected to the 2018 class of fellows of the American Mathematical Society. He is a distinguished visiting professor of mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study. He sits on the editorial board of the journal Annals of Mathematics. In 2020 he received a Simons Investigator Award. The citation reads: ""His recent work, in collaboration with André Neves, developed a full Morse theory for the area functional in closed Riemannian manifolds. The ideas introduced by them have revitalized the subject, leading to the discovery that closed minimal surfaces are ubiquitous in these spaces."" In 2021 he was awarded the Fermat Prize, ""for major advances obtained with André Neves on geometric applications of the calculus of variations"". In 2023 he received the Frontiers of Science Award. He is married to mathematician Ana Maria Menezes de Jesus. She was a student of Harold Rosenberg at IMPA, and is currently an instructor of mathematics at Princeton University. Codá Marques and Menezes have a son named Pedro and a daughter named Luisa.",Normal
"Associazione Calcistica Dilettante Cormonese, or simply Cormonese, is an Italian association football club located in Cormons, Friuli Venezia Giulia. It currently plays in Seconda Categoria Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The Cormonese was founded in 1922. In 1943–44, with Central and Northern Italy occupied by the Nazis and the constitution of the Italian Social Republic (puppet state of Nazi Germany), Cormonese entered in the mixed National Division championship, in which found far more noble groups of his own region (Venezia Giulia) such as Triestina, Pro Gorizia, Ampelea, Udinese and Ponziana. Surprisingly he won the first three games (played against Monfalconese, Ponziana and San Giusto), even flying to the top of the Julian group, but subsequently collapsed, taking only one victory in the rest of the championship in front of 10 defeats, closing penultimate in front of Ponziana alone. With the end of the war, Cormonese was admitted to the Serie C Alta Italia managed by the Lega Nazionale Alta Italia. In the 1945–46 season the team came close to promotion to Serie B: it clearly won Group A in front of Ponziana and Ampelea; Group A of the semifinals closed in second place (a group of three teams with Mestrina and Legnago) missing for two points the access to the final promotion. In the following two years, in which he played in the Northern Serie C managed by the Lega Interregionale Nord, the team was unable to maintain itself at high levels. Due to the notable reduction of Serie C clubs (from 18 to just 3 groups, then increased to 4), fifth place in Group F of the Northern Serie C 1947–48 was not enough to guarantee access to the National Serie C, and Cormonese was downgraded to the newly established interregional promotion league managed by the Northern Interregional League. In the 1948–49 season Cormonese closed Group F of Promozione Nord in last place, relegating to the regional league. In the 1969–70 season he won promotion to Serie D on the field but gave up. Cormonese returned to play in a national division only in the 1996–97 and 1997–98 seasons in which she played in C.N.D. before relegating again to Eccellenza. At the end of the 2001–02 season, Cormonese, in economic difficulties, renounced enrollment in Eccellenza and retreated to Promozione. The same economic difficulties led to bankruptcy at the end of the following season. Meanwhile, in 2001 A.S.D. Calcio Cormòns had been founded which in 2003 enrolled in Terza Categoria and on 1st July 2009 took the name of A.C.D. Cormonese. The re-founded Cormonese returned to Promozione in the 2014–15 season, however relegating after only one season. The football field was built in the 1980s and is part of the Cormons sports center complex. After several years of struggles, the Municipality finally decides to build the new facility with an adjoining training ground. The construction phases are long and bureaucratic, until on 3rd December 1986, thanks to the interest of Colonel Luigi Goretti, a friendly match between AS Cormonese and the Italy military national football team was played in Cormons, to inaugurate the playing field (at the time still without stands). Among the Azzurri players, coached by Francesco Rocca, great A.S. Roma defender, there were many Serie A players, including Luca Pellegrini and Ivano Bonetti (U.C. Sampdoria), Alberico Evani (A.C. Milan), Massimo Mauro (F.C. Juventus), Massimo Susic, originally from Mossa (Udinese Calcio), Massimo Brambati (A.S. Bari), Ciro Ferrara (S.S.C. Napoli), Aladino Valoti (Atalanta B.C.), Enrico Cucchi (Inter) and Mario Bortolazzi (Hellas Verona F.C.). In the ranks of the local club, the Cormonese player Sergio Marcon, who played 21 professional seasons in Serie A, B and C. After that game, which had considerable resonance, the Municipality decided to go ahead with the work of construction of the current stands. The club ""Cormonese Calcio"" started using the facility from the 1989–90 season. The playing field was named after the national team player, who wore the local jersey, Germano Mian. After the 2017 renovation, worth 176,000 euros, the stadium was renamed Stadio Atleti Azzurri. ACD Cormonese colors were grey and red.",Normal
"Escaladieu Abbey (French: l'Abbaye de l'Escaladieu) was a Cistercian abbey located in the French commune of Bonnemazon in the Hautes-Pyrénées. Its name derives from the Latin Scala Dei (""ladder of God""). The abbey was founded in 1142 and became an important pilgrimage stop on the Way of St. James en route to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. The abbey is situated at the confluence of the Luz and the Arros rivers near the Château de Mauvezin. In the middle of the 12th century, a group of monks under the protection of the count of Bigorre who lived at Cabadur in the Gripp valley in the modern-day commune of Campan, near Bagnères-de-Bigorre, wanted to move to a more hospitable location and therefore establish the abbey at Bonnemazon. The abbey became the center of the expansion of southern French Cistercian expansion and founded eight abbeys in Spain (including ones in Fitero, Sacraménia, and Véruéla) and two in Gascony (Flaran Abbey and Bouillas Abbey). The abbey was continuously inhabited by Cistercian monks until 1830 when it sold to an unknown local family. In 1986, the abbey was purchased by the Conseil Général des Hautes-Pyrénées which undertook its restoration. The abbey was passed by, and therefore featured in the television coverage of, the 19th stage of the Tour de France 2018. This article about a Christian monastery in France is a stub.

"Denarie Bautista Taylor (born February 8, 1997), known professionally as Bella Poarch (pɔːrtʃ PORCH), is an American social media personality and singer. On August 17, 2020, she created the most liked video on TikTok, in which she lip syncs to the song ""M to the B"" by British rapper Millie B. She is the most followed TikTok contributor from the Philippines. In May 2021, she released her debut single ""Build a Bitch"". As of December16, 2023, she has 93.7 million followers on TikTok, ranking as the third most-followed individual on the platform behind Khaby Lame and Charli D'Amelio. She signed a music record deal with Warner Records in 2021. Poarch was born on February 8, 1997 in the Philippines. She was raised by her grandmother in the slums until the age of three and was then adopted. Her adoptive father is an American who had served in the US military and her adoptive mother is Filipina. Both parents met in Saudi Arabia where her adoptive father was stationed, before settling in the Philippines. In an interview, she recounts that she and her adopted brother were heavily abused all throughout her childhood, up until her enlistment in the military. She lived on a farm with her family: her adoptive parents, and three (adopted) siblings, including two older sisters and her brother. She had many of the responsibilities for the farm, even as young as seven years old. She recounts that her adoptive sisters did not receive the same treatment as her and her brother. Poarch states that her father was verbally and physically abusive, while her mother did not get involved, but remained complicit. Her family (with exception of her sisters who still reside in the Philippines) moved to San Francisco to live with her aunt for a couple of months, before the family moved to Texas when she was 13 due to her father's need for bypass surgery. She states that although she was no longer subjected to physical abuse, her father still emotionally maltreated her at home. In January 2020, Poarch created her TikTok account. She started actively posting on TikTok based on gaming and cosplay content in April 2020. She gained notability in August 2020, when her lip sync videos went viral, most notably her video where she is lip-syncing to ""Sophie Aspin Send"" by Millie B. The zoomed-in video of her lip-syncing to that tune and rhythmically bouncing went viral and became TikTok's most liked video of all time. Following her TikTok success, she launched a YouTube channel and Twitter page in the months after she joined TikTok. Poarch is also associated with her alpaca stuffed toy. In 2020, she released a limited clothing line RIPNDIP x Paca Collaboration. In December 2020, Poarch's rising popularity peaked when she reportedly grabbed the interest of two large professional Esports organizations – 100 Thieves and FaZe Clan, which apparently showed interest in her, a live streamer and gamer at the time, as a content creator under their respective banners. In May 2021, Poarch signed a record deal with Warner Records. On May 14, 2021, Poarch released her debut single ""Build a Bitch."" She stated that the song was inspired by her experiences with being bullied as a child, disclosing ""Growing up, I used to get bullied and stuff... I wanted my first song to have a good meaning to it and to help a lot of people just to be like, more confident about themselves."" The associated music video was described by Billboard as ""an audacious, darkly comic slice of new-school pop,"" created with Daniel Virgil Maisonneuve, the producer-songwriter better known as Sub Urban."" The video features other notable internet personalities including Valkyrae, Mia Khalifa, Bretman Rock and ZHC. On an episode of the 100 Thieves podcast ""The CouRage and Nadeshot Show,” Poarch stated that she wanted to become a singer since she was a child. Poarch released her first EP, Dolls, on August 12, 2022. It includes her previous singles, ""Build a Bitch,"" ""Inferno,"" and ""Dolls,"" as well as new tracks ""Villain,"" ""No Man's Land,"" and ""Living Hell."" A music video for ""Living Hell"" debuted alongside the EP. In addition to co-starring in the music video for ""Dolls,"" Grimes features on ""No Man's Land."" Rolling Stone praised the dark pop tone of the EP. In addition, ""Villain"" would be used for WWE's Extreme Rules premium live event in 2022. She released a song and music video with Lauv on September 15, 2023 titled “Crush.” Poarch is a U.S. Navy veteran. She enlisted in the Navy in 2017 as an aviation ordnanceman and was in the musical division. She served for three years, having been stationed in Japan and Hawaii. Poarch resides in Los Angeles. She has expressed her support on social media for the Asian-American community due to the rise in reports of hate crimes against them. She also shared her experiences with Vogue, saying that she can relate to this situation because she has been ""treated differently"" and ""randomly attacked and assaulted"" as an Asian teen after moving to the U.S. from the Philippines. In September 2020, Korean social media users criticized Poarch for having a tattoo similar to the Rising Sun Flag in her videos. The specific tattoo resembled a symbol of Japanese imperialism which is considered offensive to East Asians. She apologized and had it covered then later removed. Poarch married fellow seaman Tyler Poarch in 2019. She filed for divorce from him in November 2022. In August 2021, she shared that she was a victim of sexual assault.",Normal

"SCAMPER (""Substitute, Combine, Adjust, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse"") is an acronym that provides a structured way of assisting students to think out of the box and enhance their knowledge. It is thought to protect students' creativity as they mature. SCAMPER was proposed by Alex Faickney Osborn in 1953 and was further developed by Bob Eberle in 1971 in his book — ""SCAMPER: Games for Imagination Development."" SCAMPER is an activity-based thinking process that can be performed by Cooperative learning. Here the teacher assists the students in choosing a particular topic and helps them to develop it through a structured process. After picking an idea, the students are given a tale where they perform the activity in steps corresponding to the letters in the name. Hence, SCAMPER as a teaching strategy helps the students to analyze the knowledge in its creative form and helps the teacher to make teaching creative and interesting. We can link creativity methods to Combinatorics. This article relating to education is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",Normal

"See 'n Say is an educational toy created by Mattel in 1964 after the success of Chatty Cathy. It was the first Mattel talking toy allowing children to choose the exact phrase as heard. Although the first release focuses on farm animal sounds, it had spawned through many themes from the alphabet, counting, nursery rhymes, to licensed products. As of October 2023, a version of the product was still available from Mattel. In the 1960s, after introducing a line of talking dolls that said different phrases when a string protruding from their upper back was pulled, Mattel trademarked the word chatty. Several Mattel pull-string talking dolls and toys were packaged in boxes that read ""A Chatty Toy"" or ""A Chatty Doll by Mattel"". However, these dolls and toys spoke phrases at random when their ""chatty ring"" was pulled. See 'N Say, introduced in 1964, was the first Mattel talking toy that allowed children to choose the exact phrase they wanted to hear by adjusting a pointer on the toy's face to a particular item and pulling the ""chatty ring"". The Farmer Says See 'N Say made animal sounds when a pointer shaped like a miniature farmer was aimed at pictures of animals on its dial. For example, when pointed at an image of a duck, the phrase ""The duck says...quack, quack, quack"" was heard. Likewise, the Bee Says See 'N Say recited different letters of the alphabet (""G...Girl"") when its bee-shaped pointer was aimed at them. Unlike other toys, the original See 'n Says required no batteries. Instead, sound was produced by a simple low-fidelity phonograph record driven by a metal coil wound by pulling the toy's string. This was the same mechanism used in Chatty Cathy dolls. After the success of the Bee Says, the Farmer Says, Mattel introduced several other toys in the line. The Mister Sound Says made city sounds, the Mister Music Says reproduced sounds of musical instruments, the Zookeeper says which made Zoo Animal sounds, Mister Circus says which made Circus sounds and the Clock Says gave the time indicated by the position of the pointer on its face. A Doctor Dolittle Says edition was released after the 1967 film Doctor Dolittle, and See 'N Says featuring Disney characters were introduced in 1968. In 1968 Mattel created a Winnie the Pooh See 'N Say exclusively for Sears and Roebuck department stores. Also introduced in 1968 were See 'N Say Talking Storybooks. Children would open the book to a page, aim the pointer at the arrow printed on the page, and pull the chatty ring. A pull-lever version of See 'N Say Talking Storybooks was released in the 1990s with different titles. A Mother Goose and a ""Snoopy Says"" See 'N Say were unveiled in 1969. One recited nursery rhymes the other featured Peanuts comic strip characters. Also that year, Mattel introduced Mister Circus Says and Sing-A-Song, both part of its Super See 'N Say line. These two, which were battery-operated, worked slightly differently from earlier See 'N Says. Instead of pulling a string, the pointer was pushed and released to make the toy talk. The battery-operated toys were able to recite longer phrases than earlier pull-string versions. The remaining titles for the Super See 'N Say line were, ""I Wish I Were"" and the ""Dr. Seuss Zoo"", both released in 1970. In the 1970s, See 'N Say pointers were streamlined into a uniform design, a large arrow with a sticker affixed to it depicting a bee, farmer, and so forth. In the early 1980s The Zoo Keeper Says was added to the rapidly expanding See 'N Say line. By 1989, the chatty ring was replaced by a lever that could be pulled to make the toy talk, after a Rhode Island girl was blinded by a snapped string. Playskool, a division of Hasbro manufactured the ""Sounds Around"" rival toy. Chatty records were replaced with computer chips in the 1990s. The owl shaped See 'N Say, the ""Whooo Says"" used a push button to activate it, and was the first model to use a flip-page format as well as computer chips. The new version of the Farmer Says toy still emits the same farm animal sounds that were used in the original 1965 See 'N Say. In 2001, the ""Kids Around the World"" See 'N Say was introduced that developed a different format: identifying placements on the map, had a pointer that tells which game to play, touch button countries and continents, and gameplay. In 2015, Little People released a new version of the 2003 ""Farmer Says"" version called ""Farmer Eddie Says"" and has a new voice given to the toy itself and has a different twist to two classic nursery rhymes such as ""The Farmer in the Dell"" and ""Old MacDonald Had a Farm"". A replica of the 1989 model of The Farmer Says was featured in the 1995 Disney Pixar movie Toy Story, as a resident toy living in Andy’s Room, the 1970 pull string model of The Farmer Says appeared in Toy Story 3 (2010), being used as a roulette machine by Lotso’s minions.",Normal
"Republican Seismic Survey Center– (RSSC) Republican Seismic Survey Center is the main organization, involved in the research and study of earthquakes on the territory of Azerbaijan Republic. Seismological, geophysical, geochemical and geodynamic complex researches are conducted in the Center. In Azerbaijan, the first instrumental observations began in the early XX century. In 1902, after a strong earthquake which occurred in Shamakhi, first supervision began with the initiative of Nobel Brothers to establish 3 seismic stations, thereby the instrumental observations have been started. The independent Seismological Service of Azerbaijan was restricted by the former Soviet Union for a long time. By the decision of the Council of Ministers of Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic in 1979 according to the decree of the National Academy of Sciences was created ""Geophysics"" Geophysical Research Party at the Institute of Geology of ANAS. In 1980 on its basis was founded Experimental Methodical Geophysics Expedition. The expedition was supervised by Arif Hasanov, the corresponding member of ANAS,doctor of geology-mineralogy sciences. By the decisions of Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan Republic 179 dated; 01.09.1998. and Presidium of Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences (ANAS) N222 dated 17.12.1998. EMGE was given the status of Republican Seismic Survey Center (RSSC) of ANAS in 1999.<refCHARTER OF the Republic Seismological Service Center under the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences<ref> Since 2008, the corresponding member of ANAS, ""Honoured Scientist"", the doctor of geology-mineralogy sciences, professor Yetirmishli Gurban Jalal headed the RSSC. Republican Seismic Survey Center is the main organization, involved in the research and study of earthquakes on the territory of Azerbaijan Republic. Seismological, geophysical, geochemical and geodynamic complex researches are conducted in the Center. RSSC is the only organization in CIS,where the seismological researches are conducted by a network of seismic stations operating via satellite communication. There are 84 seismic stations of RSSC operating via satellite communication on the territory of Republic. In addition, 24 GPS stations were installed in the territory of the republic by the Center. The GPS station located on the well with the depth of 8324 meters in the Saatli district of Azerbaijan is selected by its unity. There are geophysical and geochemical stations of RSSC in the territory of the republic. The Republican Seismic Survey Center of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences closely cooperates with foreign countries and international organizations. In 2008, RSSC ANAS was elected a full member of two important seismological international organizations – IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology) and ORFEUS (Observatories and Research Facilities for European Seismology). In 2012, RSSC ANAS was elected an associate member of the European Seismological Commission. Currently, there are six major international seismological organizations in the world, of which RSSC is a member – EMSC (European-Mediterranean Seismological Center), IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology), ORFEUS (Observatories and Research Facilities for European Seismology), ESC (European Seismological Commission), EGU (European Geosciences Union) and AGU (American Geophysical Union). The Department of Earthquakes of the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Turkey and the Republican Seismic Survey Center of ANAS signed a protocol of agreement following negotiations held on December 1–3, 2021, on expanding bilateral cooperation and implementing joint projects.

"""It's Your Misfortune and None of My Own"": A New History of the American West is a history of the American West. The book's title comes from the lyrics to the traditional cowboy ballad Git Along Little Dogies. The 684 page history was written by Richard White and first published by the University of Oklahoma Press in 1991. It covers the history of the West from the Spanish conquest in the 16th century to the presidency of Ronald Reagan. The book is a notable example of an approach sometimes called the ""New Western History"", which tells the story of the American West as the history of all the people in the region rather than the story of the expanding frontier of the United States. White's departure from the traditional interpretation of the American West—embodied in Frederick Jackson Turner's influential Frontier Thesis—is reflected in the fact that White never uses the word ""frontier"" in his book. The book received the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum's Western Heritage Award for non-fiction books in 1992. This article about a nonfiction book on the American Old West is a stub.

"Alexander Hale Smith (June 2, 1838 – August 12, 1909) was the third surviving son of Joseph Smith and Emma Hale Smith. Smith was born in Far West, Missouri, and was named after Alexander Doniphan, who had refused an order to execute Joseph Smith, and then was Joseph's defense attorney during Joseph's incarceration at Liberty Jail. Alexander Smith became a senior leader of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church, now Community of Christ). Smith served as an apostle and as Presiding Patriarch of the church. He became religiously inclined after the April 1862 death of his older brother Frederick G. W. Smith (b. 1836), who had not been baptized, and was baptized on May 25, 1862, in Nauvoo, Illinois, by another older brother, Joseph Smith III. Alexander was ordained an apostle on April 10, 1873, and ""served a mission to the Pacific Slope"" with David Hyrum Smith in 1875. He was ordained president of the Council of Twelve on April 15, 1890, at Lamoni, Iowa. He was called to be a counselor to his brother, Joseph Smith III, and also a patriarch and evangelical minister on April 12, 1897. He went on a mission to Australia, Hawaii, and the Society Islands in 1901. Smith was a partner in a photograph gallery before becoming a carpenter. Smith married Elizabeth Agnes Kendall in Nauvoo, on May 23, 1861. A History of Decatur County, Iowa, published in 1915, provides many details about his life and his personality: He loved the wide outdoors, land and water and sky, and delighted in athletic sports, holding a record in his younger days as one of the best skaters and one of the two surest shots in the community. Of the nine children born to him, one daughter, Mrs. Grace Madison, died and is buried in San Bernardino, California, and one son, Don A., is buried at Lamoni. The second daughter, Mrs. Ina I. Wright, lived at Avalon, New South Wales, Australia, and Mrs. Coral Horner lived near Davis City, Iowa, she spent the later years of her life with her husband in Ronan, Montana. Mrs. Emma Kennedy and the youngest sons, Joseph G. and Arthur M., resided at Independence, Missouri, while the oldest children, Fred A. and Mrs. Heman C.

Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms.

"Michael Graham (born July 14, 1963) is a retired American basketball player. He is known for his college career at Georgetown University, where he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine after helping the Hoyas to the 1984 NCAA championship. Graham, a 6'9"" power forward from Spingarn High School in Washington, D.C., signed with future Hall of Fame coach John Thompson at Georgetown. As a freshman in 1983–84, Graham became a key player for the Hoyas. He provided rugged defense and rebounding, appearing in all but two of the team's 37 games – starting 17. While his regular season statistics were pedestrian, Graham became a key player for the Hoyas in their quest for a national championship. In the 1984 Final Four, Graham scored 22 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and led the Hoyas to a victory over the Houston Cougars for the national championship. In the championship game, Graham scored 14 points on 7–9 shooting and was one of two Georgetown players to be named to the All-Final Four team along with Most Outstanding Player Patrick Ewing. Following the championship win, Graham – whose fiery demeanor and shaved head were seen as personifying the Hoyas' aggressive playing style – appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine. Following the championship season, Graham had academic difficulties and was suspended from the Georgetown team. He ultimately transferred to the University of the District of Columbia in an attempt to play Division II basketball, but ultimately declared for the 1986 NBA draft without playing a game for the Firebirds. Graham was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in the fourth round of the draft (76th pick overall), but did not make the Sonics' final roster. He played several seasons in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), for the Albany Patroons, Charleston Gunners, Wyoming Wildcatters, Rochester Flyers, Tulsa Fast Breakers and Columbus Horizon. In his four CBA seasons, Graham averaged 7.8 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. Graham also played in Europe and South America.",Normal
"The Terontola–Foligno railway is an electrified, standard-gauge Italian railway that connects the Florence–Rome railway in Terontola-Cortona with the Rome–Ancona railway in Foligno, passing through Perugia and Assisi. The railway was inaugurated in December 1866 as an integral section of the Florence–Foligno line, which was later merged with the Rome–Ancona railway, thus making journeys between Florence and Rome possible; this became more important after the conquest of Rome by Italy in 1870. In 1875, with the opening of the Terontola–Chiusi section, which shortened the Florence–Rome route by several tens of kilometres, all the trains between these two destinations were diverted to the new railway; as a result the Terontola–Foligno was relegated to the role of secondary railway. Starting in 1960, the railway underwent numerous modernisations: it was electrified, the equipment was replaced and the main station squares were rebuilt. However, the branch to Tavernelle (Panicale), which connected to the line at Ellera-Corciano station was closed due to low traffic. Electric operations on the line commenced at the timetable change of May 1960. Over time, the line has continued to play the role of connecting the Florence–Rome and the Rome–Ancona lines, frequented mostly by regional trains of various compositions and railcars of the Ferrovia Centrale Umbra, as well as by trains running directly between Perugia and Rome via Foligno. Travel times for the whole line range from 60 to 90 minutes. Doubling of the line was planned in 2011. The Terontola–Foligno line can be divided into three sections. The first section, about 25 kilometers long, winds from the junction with the Florence-Rome to the exit from Ellera-Corciano station and is characterised by long straights and very wide curves. It begins in the Tuscan territory with a two-kilometre straight from Terontola station and, after a couple of short tunnels, turns south-east reaching Tuoro station; it continues alongside Lake Trasimeno, following its profile and passing by Montecolognola with the longest tunnel of the line, about 1.3 km long, and reaching Magione; it then runs to Ellera, including a long stretch on an embankment. The second section, of about 18 km, starts from Ellera and continues to Ponte San Giovanni; it has the steepest grades of the line (around 1.0%) and the narrowest curves (although the curve radiuses are never less than 500 metres). There are also four tunnels and a masonry viaduct with five spans in the San Vetturino area. The railway winds around the Umbrian capital in a sinuous ""S"", shaped path, called the ansa di Perugia (""loop of Perugia""), which significantly extends travel times. At Ponte San Giovanni, the line crosses the Terni–Perugia–Sansepolcro railway, which runs through the entire Tiber valley in a north–south direction; a short branch (5.3km) runs from the same station to Perugia Sant'Anna, near Perugia's historic centre. The third section, about 28 km long, runs from Ponte San Giovanni to Foligno and is characterised by a totally flat area and an almost straight line, except for some bends near the towns. In this first part of the line, the main structures are a masonry bridge over the Tiber, immediately after Ponte San Giovanni station, a deep cutting in Collestrada, a metal bridge over the Chiascio and a masonry bridge over the Topino. Two stations on this last section of the line (Ospedalicchio and Cannara) have been closed due to a lack of traffic: the first has been disused since 1980, while the second closed in 1995. The facilities of the two stations still exist, but trains have not stopped there for some time. Media related to Terontola–Foligno railway at Wikimedia Commons",Normal

"In number theory, Lagrange's theorem is a statement named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange about how frequently a polynomial over the integers may evaluate to a multiple of a fixed prime. More precisely, it states that if p is a prime number, x ∈ Z p Z {displaystyle xin mathbb {Z} pmathbb {Z} } , and f ( x ) ∈ Z  {displaystyle textstyle f(x)in mathbb {Z} } is a polynomial with integer coefficients, then either: where deg f(x) is the degree of f(x). If the modulus is not prime, then it is possible for there to be more than deg f(x) solutions. The two key ideas are the following. Let g(x) ∈ (ZpZ) be the polynomial obtained from f(x) by taking the coefficients mod p. Now: More rigorously, start by noting that g(x) = 0 if and only if each coefficient of f(x) is divisible by p. Assume g(x) ≠ 0; its degree is thus well-defined. It is easy to see deg g(x) ≤ deg f(x). To prove (1), first note that we can compute g(k) either directly, i.e. by plugging in (the residue class of) k and performing arithmetic in ZpZ, or by reducing f(k) mod p. Hence g(k) = 0 if and only if f(k) ≡ 0 (mod p), i.e. if and only if f(k) is divisible by p. To prove (2), note that ZpZ is a field, which is a standard fact (a quick proof is to note that since p is prime, ZpZ is a finite integral domain, hence is a field). Another standard fact is that a non-zero polynomial over a field has at most as many roots as its degree; this follows from the division algorithm. Finally, note that two solutions f(k1) ≡ f(k2) ≡ 0 (mod p) are incongruent if and only if k 1 ≢ k 2 {displaystyle k_{1}not equiv k_{2}} (mod p). Putting everything together, the number of incongruent solutions by (1) is the same as the number of roots of g(x), which by (2) is at most deg g(x), which is at most deg f(x).",Normal

"The Young Punx are an English electronic dance music group whose eclectic and energetic style encompasses French house, breakbeat and drum and bass, mashed up with elements as diverse as 1980s pop, rock, disco and jazz. The Young Punx's music is created by producer, multi-instrumentalist and singer Hal Ritson in collaboration with an eclectic collective of guest musicians, producers and singers including Italian electro producer Phonat, virtuoso guitarist Guthrie Govan, co-founder of the act Cameron Saunders (formerly of New Atlantic), DJ Nathan Taylor and vocalists such as Yola of Massive Attack, Count Bass D, Amanda Palmer and Laura Kidd. They initially came to prominence in 20032004 after releasing a string of white label bootleg dance records which drew attention by sampling unlikely source material such as '80s Madonna tracks (foreshadowing the trend for '80s pop sampling records in the following years), Heavy metal such as Motörhead's ""The Ace of Spades"" and pop culture trends such as The Matrix films. ""Got Your Number"" – their tongue-in-cheek disco house bootleg of the iconic 118 118 TV adverts featuring music sampled from the Rocky theme gained widespread attention in late 2003 after BBC Radio 1 DJ Judge Jules played an mp3 of it on his show. Despite having only been created as a joke, the track became a UK clubland phenomenon. It was put at 25–1 odds to be Christmas Number One by William Hill bookmakers, featured in The Sun newspaper, signed to EMI and entered the UK Club Chart Top 10. However the full commercial release of the record was ultimately cancelled due to legal wrangles. In 2005, the Young Punx produced a satirical remake of Mylo's ""Destroy Rock & Roll"" entitled ""Destroy Celebrity Crap"" which replaced the original's list of 1980s pop stars with a list of the main celebrities who were currently dominating the UK media in a lighthearted backlash against the dumbing down celebrity focus of the media. Distributed for free on mp3, the track received in excess of 20,000 downloads within one week after exposure in Popbitch newsletter. Building on their reputation as bootleg remixers, which led to them being voted number 2 bootleg remixers of 2003 by listeners of BBC Radio One, The Young Punx have increasingly become one of the most in-demand remix artists in the UK. Some of their most well known mixes include ""Hideaway"" by De'lacy, ""Stoned in Love"" by Chicane and Tom Jones, ""Come on get it on"" by Studio B, ""I like girls"" by Hound Dogs and ""Rocket (a natural gambler)"" by Braund Reynolds along with tracks by the Scissor Sisters, Don Diablo, Ike & Tina Turner, The Similou, Krafty Kuts, Space Cowboy and Norman Cook's ""Mighty Dub Katz"". With a very strong following in Japan, in 2008, The Young Punx remixed Step You, a #1-song by Japanese superstar Ayumi Hamasaki. The Young Punx have released a number of original tracks commercially on vinyl, CD and mp3. 2005's ""Young and Beautiful"" was described by Fatboy Slim as ""the most insanecatchy song I have heard all year"". 2006's ""Rockall"" continued their trend for incorporating elements of popular culture into their work through sampling and re-editing the Shipping Forecast as read by BBC Radio 4 announcer Alan Smith. In February 2007, their track ""You've Got To..."" became the most podcasted track in the world (as measured by the Podmusiccountdown.com chart for that week) when they released it onto the podsafe music network. It featured as one of the songs on FIFA 07. The Young Punx's track ""Ready for the Fight"" is also featured in the demo and final release of EA Sports Fight Night Round 4, a boxing videogame on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Their debut album Your Music Is Killing Me was released in 20072008, features in EA Sports game UEFA Euro 2008.. Their second album, entitled Mashpop And Punkstep was released in March 2010 and was co-produced by Phonat with guest appearances from Count Bass D. In January 2011, their collaboration with Amanda Palmer ""Map of Tasmania"" received a quarter of a million video hits in one week. In addition to performing as a DJ duo (including supporting Tiësto at the world's largest club, Privilege Ibiza), The Young Punx perform as a live band including renowned guitarist Guthrie Govan. They have performed at major international festivals including Glastonbury Festival (2007), Summer Sonic Festival (2007), Nano Mugen Festival (2008) and Blue Balls Festival (2008). In 2006, they performed at the Nano Mugen Festival in Japan to 24,000 people. Hal Ritson, Simon Bettison and Nathan Taylor of The Young Punx also present shows in the media under The Young Punx brand. They hosted 2 seasons of the Japanese version of So You Think You Can Dance, have presented several specials on UK Dance music TV station Flaunt, and since 2007 have hosted a dance music and entertainment Podcast – ""The Young Punx FM"". In 2009, Ritson and Govan of the Young Punx worked on four tracks on Dizzee Rascal's album Tongue N Cheek, leading to The Young Punx becoming Dizzee's backing band for several full live gigs, notably the 2009 BBC Electric Proms and Glastonbury Festival 2010. The Young Punx have developed an artistic partnership with Dutch digital artist Han Hoogerbrugge in which Hoogerbrugge has developed the visual identity for the band, record artwork and a number of animated videos. Built on a darkly comic cast of surreal hand drawn characters, later animated in flash and 3-D animated packages, Hoogerbrugge's distinctive creations act both as the main public identity for the band, and as an exhibited part of Hoogerbrugge's own portfolio.",Normal

"The Digital Storage Systems Interconnect (DSSI) is a computer bus developed by Digital Equipment Corporation for connecting storage devices and clustering VAX systems. It was designed as a smaller and lower-cost replacement for the earlier DEC Computer Interconnect that would be more suitable for use in office environments. DSSI was superseded by Parallel SCSI. It was introduced in 1988 and has a bandwidth of 32 Mbits (4 MBsec) and was typically limited to a length of 25 metres (82ft). DSSI support was later extended to MIPS-based DECsystems and DEC Alpha-based AlphaServer systems. DSSI peripherals could be distinguished from narrow SCSI devices by their characteristic five-conductor power connector featuring an extra lead intended for BatteryUPS connection to power critical components in the event of a power failure. The major characteristics of the DSSI bus are: Other companies, such as CMD and Symbios Logic made DSSI compatible chipsets or peripherals, for example, CMD manufactured various models of the CDI-4000 which would allow SCSI peripherals to be used on a DSSI bus.",Normal

"Pontebba (German: Pontafel; Slovene: Tablja; Friulian: Ponteibe) is a comune (municipality) in the Regional decentralization entity of Udine in the Italian region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia. Pontebba, named after Italian: ponte meaning ""bridge"", is situated at the confluence of the Pontebbana creek and the Fella River, itself a tributary of the Tagliamento. It is located about 100 kilometres (62mi) northwest of Trieste and about 50 kilometres (31mi) north of Udine, near the border with Austria. As of 31 October 2020, Pontebba had a population of 1,344 and an area of 97.7 square kilometres (37.7sqmi). The municipality contains the frazioni (boroughs) of Aupa, Loc. Casali Costa, Loc. Casali Graben, Loc. Frattis, Loc. Gamischen, Passo Pramollo, Loc. Piani, Pietratagliata, Lagleise San Leopoldo, Studena Alta, Studena Bassa Pontebba borders the following municipalities: Dogna in the south, Hermagor-Pressegger See (Austria) in the north, Malborghetto Valbruna in the east and Moggio Udinese in the west. From the early 10th century onward, Pontebbana Creek formed the border between the March of Verona, the former Lombard Duchy of Friuli to the south, and the Bavarian March of Carinthia to the north. After the 1420 conquest of the Patriarchate of Aquileia, the settlement of Pontebba south of the creek belonged to the Domini di Terraferma of Venice. The corresponding settlement of Pontafel north of the bridge belonged to the Carinthian Canal Valley, an exclave held by the Imperial Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg, which was incorporated into the Inner Austrian territories of the Habsburg dynasty in 1759. It was only in 1874 that the Telegraph came to Pontafel. The opening of a k.k. State telegraph station with ""limited daily services"" took place at the same time as in other smaller places of the monarchy. After World War I according to the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the border of the Kingdom of Italy with the Republic of Austria was shifted up the Canal Valley north to the town of Tarvisio. The two settlements of Pontebba (Italy) and Pontafel (formerly Austrian) were finally merged on 15 August 1924. During World War II, the rail line through the town was the target of heavy aerial bombardment by the United States Army Air Forces because it was used by Germany to transport supplies to Italy. However, the aerial bombardment did not succeed in damaging the rail line, which is still in use today. Aquile Friuli-Venezia Giulia, the region's flagship ice hockey team, plays its home games at the PalaVuerich arena in Pontebba and is affiliated with the local ice sports society Sport Ghiaccio Pontebba. The team is a member of the Serie A and won the 2008 Italian Cup. Pontebba can be reached via the A23 autostrada, European route E55, running from Palmanova and the A4 to Tarvisio and the Austrian A2 Süd Autobahn, as well as by the parallel Strada Statale 13 Pontebbana. Here the Strade Provinciale 110 to the Naßfeld Pass (Italian: Passo di Pramollo) branches off.

"Michael (Dahulich) is an Orthodox archbishop in the Orthodox Church in America Diocese of New York and New Jersey. He is the former dean of St. Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary in South Canaan, Pennsylvania, and serves there as Rector and Associate Professor of New Testament and Ethics. Michael entered the clergy through the American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese, being ordained to the priesthood by Bishop John (Martin) in 1973. He served as Vice-Chancellor and as secretary to two bishops. He also was Director of Religious Education of the Johnstown deanery and taught at the Christ the Saviour Seminary. Michael joined the faculty of St. Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary in South Canaan in 1994. Michael earned a B.Th. in Theology from Christ the Saviour Seminary in Johnstown, Pennsylvania; a B.A. in Philosophy from St. Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania; and an M.A. and Ph.D. in Theology from Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. He is also studying Business at Villanova University. On September 22, 2009, Michael was elected as the bishop of OCA's newly reconstituted Diocese of New York and New Jersey. On October 24 of that year, he was tonsured a rassophore monk by Metr. Jonah at St. Tikhon's Orthodox Monastery in preparation for his consecration to the episcopacy. On December 15, 2009, by a decision of the Holy Synod, Michael was appointed administrator of the Diocese of New York and New Jersey, a position he assumed effective January 1, 2010, allowing him to begin assuming the everyday running of the diocese, pending his consecration, which took place on May 8, 2010, in Ss. Peter and Paul Orthodox Church in Jersey City, New Jersey. The son of Ann (Rosics) and the late Peter Dahulich, Michael was born in Johnson City, N.Y., on August 29, 1950. He grew up in Binghamton, N.Y., and has one brother, retired US Air Force Captain George Dahulich, who presently works for Lockheed Martin and lives in Centreville, Va.; and a sister, Barbara Knighton, who lives in Binghamton and works as a secretary at the State University of New York at Binghamton. He was baptized in the Orthodox faith as an infant at St. Michael's Church in Binghamton, where his parents had been married in 1948. His father was a convert from the Byzantine Catholic Church, and his mother was Orthodox. From the age of ten until he graduated from college and went to Seminary, Michael served as an altar boy under the tutelage of his pastor, Fr. Stephen Dutko. He attended Binghamton Central High School in 1967. His senior paper was a biography of Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras. He graduated two years later from Broome Community College, and attended Christ the Saviour Seminary in Johnstown. He completed his theological studies there in December 1972, having been mentored by Bishop John of Nyssa. While a student at the Seminary, he met Deborah Sandak, a parishioner of Christ the Saviour Cathedral in Johnstown. They were engaged on the Feast of the Protection of the Theotokos in 1972 and were married on January 21, 1973 in the Johnstown Cathedral. He was ordained by Bishop John, first to the Diaconate on February 3, 1973, in St. Peter the Apostle Chapel in Johnstown; and then to the Holy Priesthood the following day, in Christ the Saviour Cathedral. Father Michael assumed his first parish assignment at SS. Peter and Paul Church in Homer City, Pa., a small mission community which had never had a full-time priest, on Sunday, February 18, 1973. Two days later, en route to dinner at his best friend’s home in Jenners, Pa., he and his wife were in a car accident; she was killed instantly, and he was hospitalized for three months. In June 1973 he returned to serve the Homer City parish, while living at Christ the Saviour Seminary. Bishop John decided it best for him to pursue further studies after the stress of his wife's death, reasoning that he ""did best in the classroom"". The bishop applied for Michael's admission and funded his education personally. Over the next few years, Michael attended St. Vincent College in Latrobe, Pa., graduating with a degree in philosophy, and Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, graduating with a Master of Arts in Theology and later a Ph.D. in Theology, with a concentration in New Testament studies. Upon his graduation from St. Vincent College, he was named Prefect of Student Life at Christ the Saviour Seminary, a position he held for five years, until SS. Peter and Paul Church achieved parish status, and Michael became its first full-time pastor. He was assigned as instructor of Ethics at the Seminary, where he also taught Scripture and Homiletics, until he was transferred from the area in 1985. During his Ph.D. studies at Duquesne, he was also adjunct lecturer, teaching Scripture and Eastern Orthodoxy in the Theology Department at the university. For nearly 13 years Michael served SS. Peter and Paul Church, during which time it grew from 60 to more than 130 members, and from mission to parish status. The church building was brick-encased, its interior was decorated, and a rectory was built in this period. During that time Michael also served as Religious Education Director for the Johnstown Deanery and as Associate Editor of The Church Messenger. In 1982 he was elevated to the rank of Archpriest, and named Vice-Chancellor of the Diocese. In addition, until Bishop John's death in 1984, Michael served as his personal secretary. He continued as Vice-Chancellor and Secretary to Bishop Nicholas of Amissos, until December 1985, when he was transferred to Holy Ghost Church in Phoenixville, Pa., where he served as pastor for 16 years. During that time, the parish grew from 256 to nearly 450 members, including more than 100 children. Several improvements in the temple and the 20-acre facility were undertaken, and more than half a million dollars was raised toward the building of a new educational facility. A pre-school and day care was established, with the intent to grow into an Orthodox school. During that time, Michael was also named to the Study and Planning Commission and the Ecumenical Commission of the Standing Conference of the Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas (SCOBA). He served for more than a decade as the Dean of the Mid-Atlantic Deanery parishes of the Carpatho-Russian Diocese, and Vice-Chairman of the Harvest 2000 Committee on Missions, Evangelization and Diocesan Growth. He also edited the Diocesan Prayerbook, Come To Me. He was named Protopresbyter in 1998 by the Ecumenical Patriarchate, and elevated to that rank by Metropolitan Nicholas of Amissos, in his parish in Phoenixville. In 1993, Michael was asked by Archbishop Herman to teach at St. Tikhon’s Seminary, where he has served on the faculty to this day. In 2001 he was released from the Carpatho-Russian Diocese to the Orthodox Church in America, and came to serve full-time at St. Tikhon’s Seminary, first as Administrative Dean (2001–2002) and then as Dean (2002–present). His field of expertise in teaching is New Testament, and he has also taught Old Testament courses, Homiletics, Pastoral Theology, and Ethics at St. Tikhon’s. Michael was part of the team that earned national accreditation for the Seminary from the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada. He helped work on a revision of the curriculum for the Master of Divinity program, and served as Editor of the Tikhonaire; The Spirit of St. Tikhon's; By the Waters; and St. Tikhon's Theological Journal. He also works as director of recruitment, development and fund-raising at the school. Also during this time, he served as a member of the Board of Theological Education of the Orthodox Church in America, OCA Representative to the National Advisory Board of the American Bible Society, a member (and former national secretary) of the Orthodox Theological Society of America, and a member of the Advisory Board of the Orthodox Christian Association of Medicine, Psychology and Religion (OCAMPR). During his Deanship scholarships for deserving students and assistance for married students and their families have been provided. Michael has published a number of articles in theological journals, magazines and newspapers. He has had a recurring column in The Orthodox Herald on “Sobornost.” He has presented several papers, delivered numerous talks, lectures, and keynote addresses, and led many seminars and retreats in schools and parishes throughout the country, as well as teaching week-long seminars in Scripture in both Brazil and India. On August 24, 2009, Father Michael was selected as a nominee for Bishop of the Diocese of New York and New Jersey, by clergy and lay delegates at a Special Diocesan Assembly. On September 22, the Holy Synod of Bishops of the Orthodox Church in America elected him to the episcopacy, for the Diocese of New York and New Jersey.

"Henry Bugbee Kane (January 8, 1902, Cambridge, Massachusetts – February 12, 1971, Lincoln, Massachusetts) was an M.I.T. fund director, book illustrator, author of nature books for children, and nature photographer. After graduating from Phillips Exeter Academy, he matriculated at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he graduated in 1924. After graduation, he joined the Boston Edison Company as an engineer planning lighting systems for buildings and outdoor areas and then working in the company's advertising and promotion departments. After several years he resigned from Boston Edison and became at MIT an administrative assistant to MIT's president Karl T. Compton. Kane was the director of the MIT alumni fund from 1940 to 1966, when he retired. During his directorship he helped to raise eleven million dollars. Kane was an outdoor enthusiast and amateur naturalist who wrote and illustrated more than a dozen natural history books for children. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. published a series of these books. “The Tale of a Mouse” was his first book, which he wrote after realizing that there was a great lack of “factual stories of native wildlife told in a manner calculated to entertain while they instruct.” His first children’s natural history book was followed by a series of ""The Tale of..."" books about animals such as a crow, a moth, and a bullfrog, as well as ""The Tale of..."" habitats such as a wood, a meadow, and a pond. He gained considerable fame as an illustrator for nature books written by prominent authors, such as Sally Carrighar, David McCord, Wyman Richardson, and John J. Rowlands (who was one of his close friends). Kane contributed about eighty photographs to Thoreau's Walden—A Photographic Register published by A. A. Knopf in 1946. He illustrated five volumes of excerpts, edited by Dudley C. Lunt, from Thoreau's journals; the excerpts were originally published in the 1950s by W. W. Norton & Company. Mr. Kane illustrated ... John Kieran's “A Natural History of New York City.” Edwin Way Teale, reviewing the Kieran work in 1959 for The New York Times Sunday Book Review, noted: “The drawings, by Henry B.

"The Saracen Lamp is a 1970 children's book written by Ruth M. Arthur, illustrated by Margery Gill and published by Atheneum Books. The book - set in Gloucestershire, England - explores the effect of a saracen lamp on multiple generations of young women, against a historical backdrop. The character of Yusef, a bondmanslave - saracen - captured by Melisande's father during the last Crusade in the Middle East - is central to A Saracen Lamp although he is a tragic figure who dies almost immediately after the book starts. He poured his love for Melisande into the lamp he makes for her as a wedding present, and that object has an effect on her and her family for hundreds of years. The story is told in three parts, each by a separate narrator as the story moves through time. Part one takes place between 1313 and 1350, and told by Melisande, whose grandfather fought in earlier crusades (Seventh Crusade, Eighth Crusade for King Louis, while her father fought in the Ninth Crusade and was injured; and ends with her sons fighting in the Hundred Years' War. Part two is told by Alys, living in Littleperry in the sheep district of Gloucestershire as she comes of age. Unaware of her family background initially, she learns the truth and rebels against the established order by removing the saracen lamp from the household. Part three is told by Perdita in the modern era, as she discovers the past and seeks to remedy what she can. A young woman, 16-year-old Melisande marries Sir Hugh de Hervey - 6 years older than her - with reluctance, as she does not know him and wishes to continue her carefree youth at home in Southern France. Her father - wounded in the last of King Louis' Crusades against the Saracens - is feeble and weak, but wishes her to go through with this union. Yusef - who made the lamp for Melisande - has facial features similar to her father, and is very dear to her. She is disturbed in the months leading up to the marriage because her father has banished Yusef from their household, and won't tell her why. After marrying de Hervey, they go on the monthlong journey by horseback to the coast of France, Wissant and sail to Dover, and from there to their own home - Littleperry Manor - within his family's estate, Greatperry Hall, in Gloucester, England. As Melisande settles in, she frequently conflicts with The Lady Constance and dame Anne Peckham, who were united in their disapproval of her for being French and of a less wealthy background. Soon Melisande is expecting a child, and when the packmen  arrive with goods for sale as well as mail delivery, she receives a letter from Tristan stating that Yusef has died, apparently committed suicide the day after her departure. Melisande's grief takes everyone's efforts to overcome. When Joscelin is born, everyone is happy and even Lady Constance seems to finally accept Melisande. Five years later, a terrible wet spring after a vicious winter results in the death of Hugo, only after disease murrain sickened the sheep. In time, the children marry, and Melisande starts to plan to visit her parents for the first time - when King Edward III declares war on France. With close family members in both the English and French armies, Melisande is alone with her despair. She has a vision of a young child dressed very unusually - very simply - with hair short, in a chair with wheels. When she learns of pending grandchildren, she starts to hope that the young girl in her vision belongs to the future of Littleperry. Part I ends with Melisande hanging a red cross on a white sheet at the manor walls, to warn anyone coming by that the Plague had struck. Part II begins as Alys turns 12, and leaves her grandmother's house to become part of the staff at Littleperry where she becomes good friends with Cicely, the Squire's daughter. After suffering a mysterious stigma by the behaviour of everyone in the household, eventually she compels her grandmother to tell her the truth - that Squire Edwin loved her mother and fathered her, but since he never married her mother, she had no social position. As she becomes increasing bitter, she hatches a plan to accomplish several goals: to marry Perkin, free Cicely from an unwanted marriage the Squire arranged, and take revenge on her father's betrayal. As Alys, Cicely and Perkin arrive in London with the saracen lamp at Alder's Gate, they locate Amy and settle in. Alys sells the saracen lamp for less than its worth, to have funds for the rest of her plan and free herself of the guilt of taking it. However the destructiveness of her plans has unintended effects. In the end she returns alone to Littleperry, and tries to undo as much damage as she can. Part III narrated by Perdita is set in the present day. Perdita's parents are devoted missionaries who minister in Africa, and her grandmother is the last remaining Harvey still living in Littleperry. Just before her thirteenth birthday, plans are made for her to remain in England and attend a boarding school near Littleperry, however she develops an ailment and lives at Littleperry instead, with the vicar's wife coming in to give her short lessons. As she struggles with her illness, she becomes haunted by the ghost of Alys, who wants her to remain weak and unhappy. With the help of others in the family and an outsider, she becomes strong again. And a copy of the saracen lamp comes to rest again in its place at Littleperry. The beautiful lamp is gold with stained glass, made for Melisande by Yusef, her close friend and trusted bondsman (servant) of her father's household. Giving it to Melisande, Yusef says, I have made it with my own hands, in the style of my country, while I have been here in banishment. Treasure it within your walls, keep it alight that the flame of your spirit may never be quenched.' Within the novel, the lamp is described as being 'made of gold, intricately and delicately worked in a pattern of flowers, very rare and beautiful. Its light shone through rich colors like the stained glass windows in the Abbey, ruby, emerald, and amethyst glass, set like huge stones around its flame. It hung like a jeweled pendant on its slender chain.' Three days after Melisande and Sir Hugh arrive at Littleperry, his parents visit and Sir Hugh's father speaks of their recent visit with King Edward and his bride, Isabella at Windsor, and Queen Isabella being 18 at the time. After Hugo dies, packmen and roving theater players brought news of drama at the court of King Edward II, and then the celebrations around King Edward III and his new French queen, Queen Philippa in 1327. Family members fight in both sides of the Hundred Years' War starting in 1337, while the Plague ends the life of the narrator of part I. Part II opens in the 1560s mentioning the new prayer book and poor sad Queen Mary who longed for a son, her husband Spanish Philip, and the horrible prosecutions happening all around them. 'As intricately wrought as the little lamp,' is how Baron describes The Saracen Lamp, adding 'the girls don't seem so compellingly real as some of Ruth Arthur's earlier heroines.'  Historical details in The Saracen Lamp are often the reader's first experience with those periods in history.",Normal
"The mesohyl, formerly known as mesenchyme or as mesoglea, is the gelatinous matrix within a sponge. It fills the space between the external pinacoderm and the internal choanoderm. The mesohyl resembles a type of connective tissue and contains several amoeboid cells such as amebocytes, as well as fibrils and skeletal elements. For a long time, it has been largely accepted that sponges lack true tissue, but it is currently debated as to whether mesohyl and pinacoderm layers are tissues. The mesohyl is composed of the following main elements: collagen, fibronectin-like molecules, galectin, and a minor component, dermatopontin. These polypeptides form the extracellular matrix which provides the platform for specific cell adhesion as well as for signal transduction and cellular growth. The mesohyl includes a noncellular colloidal mesoglea with embedded collagen fibers, spicules and various cells, being as such a type of mesenchyme.

"As a coach: Aristeo ""Aries"" Dimaunahan (born March 21, 1978) is a Filipino former professional basketball player who is the assistant coach of the Blackwater Bossing in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA), and is the currently the head coach of the NU Lady Bulldogs of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP). He attended Grace Kindergarten, Canossa Academy and graduated from De La Salle-Lipa in 1994. He also attended the University of Santo Tomas after high school. He played in the Philippine Basketball League in his early years before being drafted by the Barangay Ginebra Kings in the 2002 PBA Draft. He was also recognized by then-Mayor Vilma Santos as the second PBA player from his hometown in Lipa City after Melchor Teves, who also graduated from De La Salle Lipa. In 2006, Dimaunahan was also part of a controversial PBA seven player trade involving Rudy Hatfield, Billy Mamaril, Rafi Reavis, and Ervin Sotto. Because sister teams such as Ginebra and Coca-Cola are not allowed to trade directly, nor can their under-teams, which applied to San Miguel Beer and Purefoods. In order to circumvent the rules, a third team, Air21 was involved in the trade, which ultimately sent Dimaunahan to Air21. After playing two seasons with the Barako Bull Energy Boosters, he was signed by the Alaska Aces as a free agent during the 2011 Governors Cup. In 2012, while with the San Miguel Beermen, he was one of five players suspended for taking place in a Basket-Brawl involving the Beermen and the entire bench of the AirAsia Philippine Patriots. After retiring as a player, Dimaunahan began a coaching career, with stints both professionally and in women's college basketball. In 2015 he served as an assistant coach with the Blackwater Elite, and in 2017 he became an assistant coach for the Lady Bulldogs. In 2015, Dimanauhan was an assistant coach for Patrick Aquino and the Philippines women's national basketball team. In 2022, after Aquino decided to focus on the women's national team, Dimaunahan was promoted as NU's head coach. Later that year, he led the Lady Bulldogs to their seventh consecutive UAAP title.  Dimaunahan is married to former child star Jane Zaleta, where he has two children.",Normal
"Test the Nation is a television programme, first broadcast in 2001 by BNN in the Netherlands. The concept is owned by Eyeworks Holding who license it to TV production companies around the world. The format is designed to allow viewers to answer a number of questions in order to measure their IQ or their ability in some other 'intellectual' area. For instance, in the UK (where the show ran between 2002 and 2007) there have been editions of the show devoted to general knowledge, knowledge of the UK itself, and the English language. There is also an annual test of the year's events just before Christmas. Typically there is a studio audience who answer the questions along with the viewer. The studio demography is broken down into categories often designed to challenge or affirm stereotypes. For example, in the United Kingdom, white-van men and fashion models are commonly thought to be less intelligent, whilst doctors and scientists are expected to score highly. The fun is in comparing your score against your compatriots. There is also a group of celebrities pitting their wits against the audience, and one or more 'experts', who comment on aspects of the particular show's topic. The format has now been made around the world in countries including Australia, Germany, Belgium, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, Indonesia, Spain (Antena 3TV), New Zealand, Denmark, Japan, Ireland and in the Middle East on the Arabic language MBC1. The British version, made by Talent Television for the BBC, was originally presented by Anne Robinson and Phillip Schofield. It ran for 17 editions between 2002 and 2007. The BBC tests were devised and standardised by the academic Colin Cooper, of Queen's University Belfast, who was sometimes referred to on the programme as 'Sooperman Cooperman'. Viewers could play along using interactive television, log onto the BBC website, or just use a pen and paper to keep score. The first show, in May 2002, was an IQ test and the six groups of 50 studio participants included blondes, builders, publicans, teachers and students. They were pitted against a group of 10 celebrities including EastEnders star Adam Woodyatt, pop music presenter Fearne Cotton, Olympic athlete Jonathan Edwards and former Sunday Times editor and broadcaster Andrew Neil. The teachers came out on top. The last IQ test in the UK was shown on 27 August 2007, when the studio groups were reality show contestants, clairvoyants, surgeons, removal men, Robinsons, Wallaces and celebrities. In this episode Danny Wallace, a successful writer, made his first appearance as co-host. He replaced Phillip Schofield, who had joined ITV at the time. Experts who joined Dr Colin Cooper on the IQ test panel have included Sylvia Herbert, a director of British Mensa (2002 and 2003) and Baroness Susan Greenfield, scientist and polymath (2004). Although there was usually an end-of-year test in the UK each year around Christmas, there wasn't one at the end of 2006. But at the start of 2007 there was a similar programme broadcast on BBC One called Your Country Needs You, presented by Patrick Kielty, with the same general format. From 2002 to 2004, the colour scheme used to change with every test. As of 2005, a red colour scheme was implemented for the questions and blue for the answer section. A bevel-like shape was added with the new graphics, title sequence and colour scheme, but it is unclear why. The fonts used were Reaction Ultra (for the title) and a font called ""iq font improved 2"" for the question graphics. As of 2005, ""DIN Mittelschrift"" was used for the questions. The American version aired as a two-hour special on Fox TV on 9 June 2003 and on 5 March 2004 as Test the Nation 2. Hosted by Mark L. Walberg and Leeza Gibbons. Test the Nation is an RTÉ Television programme, based on the successful BBC concept, Test the Nation. First airing on RTÉ One on 5 June 2006, the show follows the UK format almost identically. In studio, two presenters oversee proceedings, which feature 6 teams of 40 contestants from various sectors of society. Members of the public participate by SMS or via the internet. The Macromedia Flash applications used are identical to those used by the BBC. A trial version of the application appeared prior to the first quiz night, featuring 12 questions on a number of topics, including the Birmingham Six, the former occupants of the Grafton Street site now occupied by Brown Thomas, and which Irish alcohol company Toto Schillaci advertised for. This version of Test the Nation covers the whole island of Ireland as opposed to just the Republic; thus there is overlap between the content of the RTÉ and BBC versions of the show. As opposed to the BBC system of division by nearest city (which let people in Ireland enter if they chose Belfast), RTÉ divide results by historical Irish county. The first show The show first aired on RTÉ One on 5 June 2006, with Miriam O'Callaghan and Ray D'Arcy overseeing proceedings. As well as historical Irish counties, other questions asked for demographic division included the participants preference for tea or cappuccino, and their support for Roy Keane or Mick McCarthy during The Saipan Incident. Their in-studio teams were Hairdressers, Football fans, an extended family from County Clare, employees of Revenue, Estate Agents, a collection of people who had done their Leaving Certificate in 1986, and the ""RTÉ Allstars"", a collection of RTÉ presenters including Eddie Hobbs and Charlie Bird. The show was nominally part of, and the last show in, an RTÉ series The Time of Our Lives, covering the 20 years from 1986 to 2006, during which the Irish economy changed the country unrecognisably. The second show This aired on 1 January 2007 and was presented by Miriam again but this time Craig Doyle was her co-host. It was a test of the nation's IQ. It was revealed that the county with the highest IQ was Monaghan. Panelists included Neil Delamere, Cathy Kelly and Aoibhinn Ní Shúilleabháin. Test the Nation debuted in Canada 18 March 2007 on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation with the episode Test the Nation: IQ. A second episode called Test the Nation: Watch Your Language was broadcast on 9 September 2007, a third episode aired on 20 January 2008, called Test the Nation: Trivia, and a fourth episode Test the Nation: Sports aired on Sunday 25 May at 8 pm (8:30 NT) on CBC Television. A fifth episode Test the Nation: Canada Eh? aired on Sunday 7 September at 8 pm (8:30 NT) on CBC Television. The sixth episode called ""Test the Nation IQ"" was broadcast on 24 January 2010 and was the second version of the IQ edition. People were tested on their IQ through a test that was designed by Professor James Parker from Trent University and Professor Don Saklofske. Celebrities that had their IQ's tested included Justin Trudeau, Dragon's Den's W. Brett Wilson and Our Lady Peace's Jeremy Taggart. In an interesting twist, Test the Nation had professional hypnotherapist Donald Currie hypnotize members of each team to see if hypnosis could help them achieve better IQ test scores. 13 of the hypnotized group did experience a jump in IQ score of up to 10 points. The Canadian show was hosted by Wendy Mesley and Brent Bambury for the first five editions, except Test the Nation: Sports, which was hosted by Ron MacLean and Wendy Mesley. The sixth edition was hosted by George Stroumboulopoulos and Carole MacNeil. In the Canadian version, celebrity guests are selected to represent one of six in-studio teams. The celebrity guests also take the test and the top celebrity's score is revealed on air. Test the Nation: Trivia featured celebrities: Farley Flex, Debbie Travis, Lorne Cardinal, Carlo Rota, Samantha Bee and Tricia Helfer. Test the Nation: Sports celebrity guests are Paul Coffey, Debra DiGiovanni, Alan Thicke, Brian Bailey, Victoria Pratt and Chris Murphy. All of the episodes were written by George Westerholm and Edward Kay. The Australian version, titled Test Australia: The National IQ Test, was the most viewed television show in Australia in 2002. Versions of the program aired in 2003 and again in 2010. The Italian version, titled Fratelli di Test, was aired in Italy in 2007.",Normal
"Pickett's Charge (July 3, 1863), also known as the Pickett–Pettigrew–Trimble Charge, was an infantry assault ordered by Confederate General Robert E. Lee against Major General George G. Meade's Union positions on the last day of the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania during the Civil War. Confederate troops made a frontal assault toward the center of Union lines, ultimately being repulsed with heavy casualties. Suffering from a lack of preparation and problems from the onset, the attack was a costly mistake that decisively ended Lee's invasion of the north and forced a retreat back to Virginia. The charge is popularly named after Major General George Pickett, one of three Confederate generals (all under the command of Lieutenant General James Longstreet) who led the assault. Pickett's Charge was part of Lee's ""general plan"" to take Cemetery Hill and the network of roads it commanded. His military secretary, Armistead Lindsay Long, described Lee's thinking: There was... a weak point... where , sloping westward, formed the depression through which the Emmitsburg road passes. Perceiving that by forcing the Federal lines at that point and turning toward Cemetery Hill  would be taken in flank and the remainder would be neutralized.... Lee determined to attack at that point, and the execution was assigned to Longstreet. Lee believed that, after Confederate attacks on both the left and right flanks of the Union lines on July 2, Meade would concentrate his defenses there to the detriment of his center. However, on the night of July 2, Meade correctly predicted to General John Gibbon, after a council of war, that Lee would attack the center of his lines the following morning and reinforced that area with additional soldiers and artillery. The infantry assault was preceded by a massive artillery bombardment that was meant to soften up the Union defense and silence its artillery, but it was largely ineffective. Approximately 12,500 men in nine infantry brigades advanced over open fields for three-quarters of a mile (1200m) under heavy Union artillery and rifle fire. Although some Confederates were able to breach the low stone wall that shielded many of the Union defenders, they could not maintain their hold and were repelled with over 50 percent casualties. Often cited as one of the turning points of the war, the farthest point reached by the attack has been referred to as the high-water mark of the Confederacy. Pickett's Charge was planned for three Confederate divisions, commanded by Maj. Gen. George Pickett, Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew, and Maj. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble, consisting of troops from Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's First Corps and Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill's Third Corps. Pettigrew commanded brigades from Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's old division, under Col. Birkett D. Fry (Archer's Brigade), Col. James K. Marshall (Pettigrew's Brigade), Brig. Gen. Joseph R. Davis, and Col. John M. Brockenbrough. Trimble, commanding Maj. Gen. Dorsey Pender's division, had the brigades of Brig. Gens. Alfred M. Scales (temporarily commanded by Col. William Lee J. Lowrance) and James H. Lane. Two brigades from Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's division (Hill's Corps) were to support the attack on the right flank: Brig. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox and Col. David Lang (Perry's brigade). The target of the Confederate assault was the center of the Union Army of the Potomac's II Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock. Directly in the center was the division of Brig. Gen. John Gibbon with the brigades of Brig. Gen. William Harrow, Col. Norman J. Hall, and Brig. Gen. Alexander S. Webb. On the night of July 2, Meade correctly predicted to Gibbon at a council of war that Lee would try an attack on Gibbon's sector the following morning. To the north of this position were brigades from the division of Brig. Gen. Alexander Hays, and to the south was Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday's division of the I Corps, including the 2nd Vermont Brigade of Brig. Gen. George J. Stannard and the 121st Pennsylvania under the command of Col. Chapman Biddle. Meade's headquarters were just behind the II Corps line, in the small house owned by the widow Lydia Leister. The specific objective of the assault has been the source of historical controversy. Traditionally, the ""copse of trees"" on Cemetery Ridge has been cited as the visual landmark for the attacking force. Historical treatments such as the 1993 film Gettysburg continue to popularize this view, which originated in the work of Gettysburg Battlefield historian John B. Bachelder in the 1880s. However, recent scholarship, including published works by some Gettysburg National Military Park historians, has suggested that Lee's goal was actually Ziegler's Grove on Cemetery Hill, a more prominent and highly visible grouping of trees about 300 yards (274m) north of the copse. The much-debated theory suggests that Lee's general plan for the second-day attacks (the seizure of Cemetery Hill) had not changed on the third day, and the attacks on July 3 were also aimed at securing the hill and the network of roads it commanded. The copse of trees, currently a prominent landmark, was under ten feet (3m) high in 1863, visible to a portion of the attacking columns only from certain parts of the battlefield. From the beginning of the planning, things went awry for the Confederates. While Pickett's division had not been used yet at Gettysburg, A. P. Hill's health became an issue and he did not participate in selecting which of his troops were to be used for the charge. Some of Hill's corps had fought lightly on July 1 and not at all on July 2. However, troops that had done heavy fighting on July 1 ended up making the charge. Although the assault is known to popular history as Pickett's Charge, overall command was given to James Longstreet, and Pickett was one of his divisional commanders. Lee did tell Longstreet that Pickett's fresh division should lead the assault, so the name is appropriate, although some recent historians have used the name Pickett–Pettigrew–Trimble Assault (or, less frequently, Longstreet's Assault) to more fairly distribute the credit (or blame). With Hill sidelined, Pettigrew's and Trimble's divisions were delegated to Longstreet's authority as well. Thus, Pickett's name has been lent to a charge in which he commanded 3 out of the 11 brigades while under the supervision of his corps commander throughout. Pickett's men were almost exclusively from Virginia, with the other divisions consisting of troops from North Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. The supporting troops under Wilcox and Lang were from Alabama and Florida. In conjunction with the infantry assault, Lee planned a cavalry action in the Union rear. Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart led his cavalry division to the east, prepared to exploit Lee's hoped-for breakthrough by attacking the Union rear and disrupting its line of communications (and retreat) along the Baltimore Pike. Despite Lee's hope for an early start, it took all morning to arrange the infantry assault force. Neither Lee's nor Longstreet's headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight. Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames this oversight on Longstreet, describing it either as a misunderstanding of Lee's oral order or a mistake. Some of the many criticisms of Longstreet's Gettysburg performance by the postbellum Lost Cause authors cite this failure as evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee's plan for the battle. Meanwhile, on the far right end of the Union line, a seven-hour battle raged for the control of Culp's Hill. Lee's intent was to synchronize his offensive across the battlefield, keeping Meade from concentrating his numerically superior force, but the assaults were poorly coordinated and Maj. Gen. Edward ""Allegheny"" Johnson's attacks against Culp's Hill petered out just as Longstreet's cannonade began. Meade knew another attack was imminent and sent a note to all his subordinates to scrape all stragglers and idle units and put them on the line. The infantry charge was preceded by what Lee hoped would be a powerful and well-concentrated cannonade of the Union center, destroying the Union artillery batteries that could defeat the assault and demoralizing the Union infantry. But a combination of inept artillery leadership and defective equipment doomed the barrage from the beginning. Longstreet's corps artillery chief, Col. Edward Porter Alexander, had effective command of the field; Lee's artillery chief, Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton, played little role other than to obstruct the effective placement of artillery from the other two corps. Despite Alexander's efforts, then, there was insufficient concentration of Confederate fire on the objective. The July 3 bombardment was likely the largest of the war, with hundreds of cannons from both sides firing along the lines for one to two hours, starting around 1 p.m. Confederate guns numbered between 150 and 170 and fired from a line over two miles (3km) long, starting in the south at the Peach Orchard and running roughly parallel to the Emmitsburg Road. Confederate Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law wrote, ""The cannonade in the center... presented one of the most magnificent battle-scenes witnessed during the war. Looking up the valley towards Gettysburg, the hills on either side were capped with crowns of flame and smoke, as 300 guns, about equally divided between the two ridges, vomited their iron hail upon each other."" Despite its ferocity, the fire was mostly ineffectual. Confederate shells often overshot the infantry front lines—in some cases because of inferior shell fuses that delayed detonation—and the smoke covering the battlefield concealed that fact from the gunners. Union artillery chief Brig. Gen. Henry J. Hunt had only about 80 guns available to conduct counter-battery fire; the geographic features of the Union line had limited areas for effective gun emplacement. He also ordered that firing cease to conserve ammunition, but to fool Alexander, Hunt ordered his cannons to cease fire slowly to create the illusion that they were being destroyed one by one. By the time all of Hunt's cannons ceased fire, and still blinded by the smoke from battle, Alexander fell for Hunt's deception and believed that many of the Union batteries had been destroyed. Hunt had to resist the strong arguments of Hancock, who demanded Union fire to lift the spirits of the infantrymen pinned down by Alexander's bombardment. Even Meade was affected by the artillery—the Leister house was a victim of frequent overshots, and he had to evacuate with his staff to Powers Hill. The counter-battery fire depleted the northern ammunition stocks, leaving them insufficient time to replenish before the southern assault. For the rest of his life, Hunt always maintained that had he been allowed to do what he'd intended—saved his long range shells for the attack he knew was coming, then bombarded the Confederate forces with every gun available once they lined up for their advance—the charge would never have happened and many northern lives would have been saved. The day was hot, 87°F (31°C) by one account, and humid, and the Confederates suffered under the hot sun and from the Union counter-battery fire as they awaited the order to advance. When Union cannoneers overshot their targets, they often hit the massed infantry waiting in the woods of Seminary Ridge or in the shallow depressions just behind Alexander's guns, causing significant casualties before the charge began. Longstreet had opposed the charge from the beginning, convinced the charge would fail (which ultimately proved true), and had his own plan that he would have preferred for a strategic movement around the Union left flank. In his memoirs, he recalled telling Lee: General, I have been a soldier all my life. I have been with soldiers engaged in fights by couples, by squads, companies, regiments, divisions, and armies, and should know, as well as any one, what soldiers can do. It is my opinion that no fifteen thousand men ever arrayed for battle can take that position. Longstreet wanted to avoid personally ordering the charge by attempting to pass the mantle onto young Colonel Alexander, telling him that he should inform Pickett at the optimum time to begin the advance, based on his assessment that the Union artillery had been effectively silenced. Although he hadn't become aware of such a development, Alexander eventually notified Pickett that he was running dangerously short of ammunition, sending the message ""If you are coming at all, come at once, or I cannot give you proper support, but the enemy's fire has not slackened at all. At least eighteen guns are still firing from the cemetery itself."" Pickett asked Longstreet, ""General, shall I advance?"" Longstreet recalled in his memoirs, ""The effort to speak the order failed, and I could only indicate it by an affirmative bow."" Longstreet made one final attempt to call off the assault. After his encounter with Pickett, he discussed the artillery situation with Alexander, and was informed that Alexander did not have full confidence that all the enemy's guns were silenced, and that the Confederate ammunition was almost exhausted. Longstreet ordered Alexander to stop Pickett, but the young colonel explained that replenishing his ammunition from the trains in the rear would take over an hour, and this delay would nullify any advantage the previous barrage had given them. The infantry assault went forward without the Confederate artillery close support that had been originally planned. The entire force that stepped off toward the Union positions at about 2:00p.m. comprised about 12,500 men. Although the attack is popularly called a ""charge"", the men marched deliberately in line, prepared to speed up and charge only when they were within a few hundred yards of the enemy. The line consisted of Pettigrew and Trimble on the left, and Pickett to the right. The nine brigades of men stretched over a mile-long (1,600m) front. The Confederates immediately encountered heavy artillery fire and were slowed by fences in their path. Fire from Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery's concealed artillery positions north of Little Round Top raked the Confederate right flank, artillery fire from Cemetery Hill hit the left, while the center faced the cannons of the II Corps with the Union artillery reserve in a second line behind. The ground between Seminary Ridge and Cemetery Ridge is slightly undulating, and the advancing troops periodically disappeared from the view of the Union cannoneers while advancing the nearly three quarters of a mile across open fields to reach the Union line. As the three Confederate divisions advanced, awaiting Union soldiers began shouting ""Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg!"" in reference to the disastrous Union advance on the Confederate line during the 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg. Shell and solid shot in the beginning turned to canister and musket fire as the Confederates came within 400yards of the Union line. At this point Confederate unit cohesion and morale began to break down. The last shelter before reaching the Union lines lay at 300 yards, in the sunken depression of the Emmitsburg Road. Thousands of Confederates took to the ground there and refused to advance any further, many surrendering to Union troops after the battle. Over two-thirds of the initial force may have failed to make the final charge; at contact the mile-long front had shrunk to less than half a mile, as the men filled in gaps that appeared throughout the line and followed the natural tendency to move away from the flanking fire. On the left flank of the attack, Brockenbrough's brigade was devastated by artillery fire from Cemetery Hill. They were also subjected to a surprise musket fusillade from the 8th Ohio Infantry regiment. The 160 Ohioans, firing from a single line, so surprised Brockenbrough's Virginians—already demoralized by their losses to artillery fire—that they panicked and fled back to Seminary Ridge, crashing through Trimble's division and causing many of his men to bolt as well. The Ohioans followed up with a successful flanking attack on Davis's brigade of Mississippians and North Carolinians, which was now the left flank of Pettigrew's division. The survivors were subjected to increasing artillery fire from Cemetery Hill. More than 1,600 rounds were fired at Pettigrew's men during the assault. This portion of the assault never advanced much farther than the sturdy fence at the Emmitsburg Road. By this time, the Confederates were close enough to be fired on by artillery canister and Alexander Hays' division unleashed very effective musketry fire from behind 260 yards of stone wall, with every rifleman of the division lined up as many as four deep, exchanging places in line as they fired and then fell back to reload. They were at once enveloped in a dense cloud of smoke and dust. Arms, heads, blankets, guns and knapsacks were thrown and tossed into the clear air. ... A moan went up from the field, distinctly to be heard amid the storm of battle. Lt. Col. Franklin Sawyer, 8th Ohio Trimble's division of two brigades followed Pettigrew's, but made poor progress. Confusing orders from Trimble caused Lane to send only three and a half of his North Carolina regiments forward. Renewed fire from the 8th Ohio and the onslaught of Hays' riflemen prevented most of these men from getting past the Emmitsburg Road. Scales's North Carolina brigade, led by Col. William L. J. Lowrance, started with a heavier disadvantage—they had lost almost two-thirds of their men on July 1. They were also driven back and Lowrance was wounded. The Union defenders also took casualties, but Hays encouraged his men by riding back and forth just behind the battle line, shouting ""Hurrah! Boys, we're giving them hell!"". Two horses were shot out from under him. Historian Stephen W. Sears calls Hays' performance ""inspiring"". On the right flank, Pickett's Virginians crossed the Emmitsburg road and wheeled partially to their left to face northeast. They marched in two lines, led by the brigades of Brig. Gen. James L. Kemper on the right and Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett on the left; Brig. Gen. Lewis A. Armistead's brigade followed closely behind. As the division wheeled to the left, its right flank was exposed to McGilvery's guns and the front of Doubleday's Union division on Cemetery Ridge. Stannard's Vermont Brigade marched forward, faced north, and delivered withering fire into the rear of Kemper's brigade. At about this time, Hancock, who had been prominent in displaying himself on horseback to his men during the Confederate artillery bombardment, was wounded by a bullet striking the pommel of his saddle, entering his inner right thigh along with wood fragments and a large bent nail. He refused evacuation to the rear until the battle was settled. As Pickett's men advanced, they withstood the defensive fire of first Stannard's brigade, then Harrow's, and then Hall's, before approaching a minor salient in the Union center, a low stone wall taking an 80-yard right-angle turn known afterward as ""The Angle"". It was defended by Brig. Gen. Alexander S. Webb's Philadelphia Brigade. Webb placed the two remaining guns of (the severely wounded) Lt. Alonzo Cushing's Battery A, 4th U.S. Artillery, at the front of his line at the stone fence, with the 69th and 71st Pennsylvania regiments of his brigade to defend the fence and the guns. The two guns and 940 men could not match the massive firepower that Hays' division, to their right, had been able to unleash. Two gaps opened up in the Union line: the commander of the 71st Pennsylvania ordered his men to retreat when the Confederates came too close to the Angle; south of the copse of trees, the men of the 59th New York (Hall's brigade) inexplicably bolted for the rear. In the latter case, this left Captain Andrew Cowan and his 1st New York Independent Artillery Battery to face the oncoming infantry. Assisted personally by artillery chief Henry Hunt, Cowan ordered five guns to fire double canister simultaneously. The entire Confederate line to his front disappeared. The gap vacated by most of the 71st Pennsylvania, however, was more serious, leaving only a handful of the 71st, 268 men of the 69th Pennsylvania, and Cushing's two 3-inch rifled guns to receive the 2,500 to 3,000 men of Garnett's and Armistead's brigades as they began to cross the stone fence. The Irishmen of the 69th Pennsylvania resisted fiercely in a melee of rifle fire, bayonets, and fists. Webb, mortified that the 71st had retreated, brought the 72nd Pennsylvania (a Zouave regiment) forward. Initially, the regiment was hesitant to attack, this being due to the regiment not recognizing Webb as brigadier general (he had recently been promoted.) However, the 72nd moved forward after realizing their error, helping to plug the gap in the line. During the fight, Lt. Cushing was killed as he shouted to his men, three bullets striking him, the third in his mouth. The Confederates seized his two guns and turned them to face the Union troops (to no avail, as the armaments lacked ammunition). At this point, Union soldiers arrived and successfully charged into the breach. The advancing Northerners overwhelmed the Confederate forces; the rebel advance then collapsed in turn. Given that Union forces had killed each senior Confederate officer commanding the forward-most units, no man had the authority to command the Southern forces to fall back in an orderly manner. This resulted in a disorganized retreat. As they left the battlefield, several Union officers on horseback picked up fallen Confederate battle flags and rode back and forth across the lines, dragging the flags behind them on the ground to taunt the retreating southerners. The infantry assault lasted less than an hour. The supporting attack by Wilcox and Lang on Pickett's right was never a factor; they did not approach the Union line until after Pickett was defeated, and their advance was quickly broken up by McGilvery's guns and by the Vermont Brigade. While the Union lost about 1,500 killed and wounded, the Confederate casualty rate was over 50%. Pickett's division suffered 2,655 casualties (498 killed, 643 wounded, 833 wounded and captured, and 681 captured, unwounded). Pettigrew's losses are estimated to be about 2,700 (470 killed, 1,893 wounded, 337 captured). Trimble's two brigades lost 885 (155 killed, 650 wounded, and 80 captured). Wilcox's brigade reported losses of 200, Lang's about 400. Thus, total losses during the attack were 6,555, of which at least 1,123 Confederates were killed on the battlefield, 4,019 were wounded, and a good number of the injured were also captured. Confederate prisoner totals are difficult to estimate from their reports; Union reports indicated that 3,750 men were captured. The casualties were also high among the commanders of the charge. Trimble and Pettigrew were the most senior casualties of the day; Trimble lost a leg, and Pettigrew received a minor wound to the hand (only to die from a bullet to the abdomen suffered in a minor skirmish during the retreat to Virginia). In Pickett's division, 26 of the 40 field grade officers (majors, lieutenant colonels, and colonels) were casualties—twelve killed or mortally wounded, nine wounded, four wounded and captured, and one captured. All of his brigade commanders fell: Kemper was wounded seriously, captured by Union soldiers, rescued, and then captured again during the retreat to Virginia; Garnett and Armistead were killed. Garnett had a previous leg injury and rode his horse during the charge, despite knowing that conspicuously riding a horse into heavy enemy fire would mean almost certain death. Armistead, known for leading his brigade with his cap on the tip of his sword, made the farthest progress through the Union lines. He was mortally wounded, falling near ""The Angle"" at what is now called the high-water mark of the Confederacy and died two days later in a Union hospital. Ironically, the Union troops that fatally wounded Armistead were under the command of his old friend, Winfield Scott Hancock, who was himself severely wounded in the battle. Per his dying wishes, Longstreet delivered Armistead's Bible and other personal effects to Hancock's wife, Almira. Of the 15 regimental commanders in Pickett's division, the Virginia Military Institute produced 11 and all were casualties—six killed, five wounded. Stuart's cavalry action in indirect support of the infantry assault was unsuccessful. He was met and stopped by Union cavalry under the command of Brig. Gen. David McMurtrie Gregg about three miles (5km) to the east, in East Cavalry Field. As soldiers straggled back to the Confederate lines along Seminary Ridge, Lee feared a Union counteroffensive and tried to rally his center, telling returning soldiers and Wilcox that the failure was ""all my fault"". Pickett was inconsolable for the rest of the day and never forgave Lee for ordering the charge. When Lee told Pickett to rally his division for the defense, Pickett allegedly replied, ""General, I have no division."" The Union counteroffensive never came; the Army of the Potomac was exhausted and nearly as damaged at the end of the three days as the Army of Northern Virginia. Meade was content to hold the field. On July 4, the armies observed an informal truce and collected their dead and wounded. Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant accepted the surrender of the Vicksburg garrison along the Mississippi River, splitting the Confederacy in two. These two Union victories are generally considered the turning point of the American Civil War. History may never know the true story of Lee's intentions at Gettysburg. He never published memoirs, and his after-action report from the battle was cursory. Most of the senior commanders of the charge were casualties and did not write reports. Pickett's report was apparently so bitter that Lee ordered him to destroy it, and no copy has been found. Years later, when asked why the charge at Gettysburg failed, Pickett reportedly said, ""I've always thought the Yankees had something to do with it."" Virginian newspapers praised Pickett's Virginia division as making the most progress during the charge, and the papers used Pickett's comparative success as a means of criticizing the actions of the other states' troops during the charge. It was this publicity that played a significant factor in selecting the name Pickett's Charge. Pickett's military career was never the same after the charge, and he was displeased about having his name attached to the repulsed charge. In particular North Carolinians have long taken exception to the characterizations and point to the poor performance of Brockenbrough's Virginians in the advance as a major causative factor of failure. Some historians have questioned the primacy of Pickett's role in the battle. W. R. Bond wrote in 1888, ""No body of troops during the last war made as much reputation on so little fighting."" Additional controversy developed after the battle about Pickett's personal location during the charge. The fact that fifteen of his officers and all three of his brigadier generals were casualties while Pickett managed to escape unharmed led many to question his proximity to the fighting and, by implication, his personal courage. The 1993 film Gettysburg depicts him observing on horseback from the Codori Farm at the Emmitsburg Road, but there is no historical evidence to confirm this. It was established doctrine in the Civil War that commanders of divisions and above would ""lead from the rear"", while brigade and more junior officers were expected to lead from the front, and while this was often violated, there was nothing for Pickett to be ashamed of if he coordinated his forces from behind. Pickett's Charge has become one of the central symbols of the literary and cultural movement known as the Lost Cause, in particular for Virginians. Proponents extol the bravery of Confederate soldiers attacking headlong into Union lines, the capable leadership of southern generals inspiring overwhelming confidence in their men, especially that of Virginians such as Lee and Pickett, and the tantalizing closeness of ultimate victory. William Faulkner, the quintessential Southern novelist, summed up the picture in Southern myth of this gallant but futile episode: For every Southern boy fourteen years old, not once but whenever he wants it, there is the instant when it's still not yet two o'clock on that July afternoon in 1863, the brigades are in position behind the rail fence, the guns are laid and ready in the woods and the furled flags are already loosened to break out and Pickett himself with his long oiled ringlets and his hat in one hand probably and his sword in the other looking up the hill waiting for Longstreet to give the word and it's all in the balance, it hasn't happened yet, it hasn't even begun yet, it not only hasn't begun yet but there is still time for it not to begin against that position and those circumstances which made more men than Garnett and Kemper and Armistead and Wilcox look grave yet it's going to begin, we all know that, we have come too far with too much at stake and that moment doesn't need even a fourteen-year-old boy to think This time. Maybe this time with all this much to lose than all this much to gain: Pennsylvania, Maryland, the world, the golden dome of Washington itself to crown with desperate and unbelievable victory the desperate gamble, the cast made two years ago. Over time this view came to dominate perceptions of the battle, despite the initial protestations from groups both north and south. Northern veterans in particular opposed the decreasing emphasis on their hard-fought defense of Cemetery Ridge in favor of extolling the bravery and sacrifice of the attacking Confederate army. Non-Virginian southerners took offense at the overwhelming focus the myth places on Virginian leaders and Virginian troops, despite that larger number of Northern Carolina troops, who sustained greater casualties than the Virginian regiments. Nevertheless, after decades of strident historicizing this narrative had firmly taken root and by the battle's 50th anniversary in 1913 it had become in many ways the standard interpretation of what occurred. Modern analysis, however, has increasingly shifted away from many of the Lost Cause interpretation's tenets. Lee's decision to conduct the attack has been characterized as the culmination of multiple strategic and tactical blunders, and the sacrifice of his troops as unnecessary. Examination of casualty records, capture reports, and first hand accounts has revealed that substantial numbers of Confederate troops involved in the attack refused to make the final charge, instead choosing to shelter in the sunken depression of the Emmitsburg Road and surrender to Union soldiers after the battle. And later research has shown that it is unlikely Pickett's charge could ever have provided the decisive victory imagined by Lee; a study using the Lanchester model to examine several alternative scenarios suggested that Lee could have captured a foothold on Cemetery Ridge if he had committed several more infantry brigades to the charge; but this likely would have left him with insufficient reserves to hold or exploit the position afterwards. The site of Pickett's Charge is one of the best-maintained portions of the Gettysburg Battlefield. Despite millions of annual visitors to Gettysburg National Military Park, very few have walked in the footsteps of Pickett's division. The National Park Service maintains a neat, mowed path alongside a fence that leads from the Virginia Monument on West Confederate Avenue (Seminary Ridge) due east to the Emmitsburg Road in the direction of the Copse of Trees. Pickett's division, however, started considerably south of that point, near the Spangler farm, and wheeled to the north after crossing the road. In fact, the Park Service pathway stands between the two main thrusts of Longstreet's assault—Trimble's division advanced north of the current path, while Pickett's division moved from farther south. A cyclorama painting by the French artist Paul Philippoteaux entitled The Battle of Gettysburg, also known as the Gettysburg Cyclorama, depicts Pickett's Charge from the vantage point of the Union defenders on Cemetery Ridge. Completed and first exhibited in 1883, it is one of the last surviving cycloramas in the United States. It was restored and relocated to the new National Park Service Visitor Center in September 2008. Notes References Sources Further reading",Normal

"Städtisches Luisengymnasium München is a secondary school located in Maxvorstadt, Munich, Bavaria, Germany. The Luisengymnasium is located in the Maxvorstadt district of Munich near the main train station at Luisenstraße 7. The school is centrally located on the Old Botanical Garden in the immediate vicinity of Stachus and Königsplatz. Founded in 1822 as the ""School for Higher Daughters"" and co-educational since 1969, it is Munich's oldest municipal high school and one of the few schools with its own school constitution. The Luisengymnasium is named after Princess Ludovika Wilhelmine of Bavaria, who later became Duchess Luise. She was the daughter of Maximilian I. Joseph (Bavaria) and mother of the legendary Sisi. She was very influential and enjoyed tremendous prestige. In 1812, Gartenstrasse, which was then on the outskirts of the city, was renamed Luisenstrasse in her honor. The school was founded by Simon Spitzweg, the father of the famous painter Carl Spitzweg. In 1901 the students moved into the school house planned by Theodor Fischer. Peace activist Marie Zehetmaier was one of the first women to get a job as a physics and math teacher. From 1905 she taught at the Luisengymnasium. When the ""School for Higher Daughters"" moved to the newly built Theodor Fischer Building in 1901, the Munich school called it the Luis School. In 1961, the already common name was also given a formal name, and from then on the school could call itself the Municipal Luisengymnasium.48°08′34″N 11°33′42″E﻿ ﻿48.14278°N 11.56167°E﻿ 48.14278; 11.56167 After the destruction of the Second World War made a four-year evacuation necessary, the students moved back to the renovated building in 1949.

"A supersecondary structure is a compact three-dimensional protein structure of several adjacent elements of a secondary structure that is smaller than a protein domain or a subunit. Supersecondary structures can act as nucleations in the process of protein folding. A helix hairpin, also known as an alpha-alpha hairpin, is composed of two antiparallel alpha helices connected by a loop of two or more residues. True to its name, it resembles a hairpin. A longer loop has a greater number of possible conformations. If short strands connect the helices, then the individual helices will pack together through their hydrophobic residues. The function of a helix hairpin is unknown; however, a four helix bundle is composed of two helix hairpins, which have important ligand binding sites. A helix corner, also called an alpha-alpha corner, has two alpha helices almost at right angles to each other connected by a short 'loop'. This loop is formed from a hydrophobic residue. The function of a helix corner is unknown. The helix-loop-helix structure has two helices connected by a 'loop'. These are fairly common and usually bind ligands. For example, calcium binds with the carboxyl groups of the side chains within the loop region between the helices. The helix-turn-helix motif is important for DNA binding and is therefore in many DNA binding proteins. A beta hairpin is a common supersecondary motif composed of two anti-parallel beta strands connected by a loop. The structure resembles a hairpin and is often found in globular proteins. The loop between the beta strands can range anywhere from 2 to 16 residues. However, most loops contain less than seven residues. Residues in beta hairpins with loops of 2, 3, or 4 residues have distinct conformations. However, a wide range of conformations can be seen in longer loops, which are sometimes referred to as 'random coils'. A beta-meander consists of consecutive antiparallel-beta strands linked by hairpins. Two residue loops are called beta turns or reverse turns. Type I' and Type II' reverse turns occur most frequently because they have less steric hindrance than Type I and Type II turns. The function of beta hairpins is unknown. A beta hairpin has two antiparallel beta strands that are at about a 90 degree angle to each other. It is formed by a beta hairpin changing direction with one strand having a glycine residue and the other strand having a beta bulge. Beta corners have no known function. A Greek key motif has four features: The Greek key motif has its name because the structure looks like the pattern seen on Greek urns. This motif has no known function. β-sheets (composed of multiple hydrogen-bonded individual β-strands) are sometimes considered a secondary or supersecondary structure. A beta-alpha-beta motif is composed of two beta strands joined by an alpha helix through connecting loops. The beta strands are parallel, and the helix is also almost parallel to the strands. This structure can be seen in almost all proteins with parallel strands. The loops connecting the beta strands and alpha helix can vary in length and often binds ligands. Beta-alpha-beta helices can be either left-handed or right-handed. When viewed from the N-terminal side of the beta strands, so that one strand is on top of the other, a left-handed beta-alpha-beta motif has the alpha helix on the left side of the beta strands. The more common right-handed motif would have an alpha helix on the right side of the plane containing the beta strands. Rossman folds, named after Michael Rossman, consist of 3 beta strands and 2 helices in an alternating fashion: beta strand, helix, beta strand, helix, beta strand. This motif tends to reverse the direction of the chain within a protein. Rossman folds have an important biological function in binding nucleotides such as NAD within most dehydrogenases.",Normal
"Kurt Lewin (ləˈviːn lə-VEEN; 9 September 1890 – 12 February 1947) was a German-American psychologist, known as one of the modern pioneers of social, organizational, and applied psychology in the United States. During his professional career Lewin applied himself to three general topics: applied research, action research, and group communication. Lewin is often recognized as the ""founder of social psychology"" and was one of the first to study group dynamics and organizational development. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Lewin as the 18th-most cited psychologist of the 20th century. Lewin was born in 1890 into a Jewish family in Mogilno, County of Mogilno, Province of Posen, Prussia (modern Poland). It was a small village of about 5,000 people, about 150 of whom were Jewish. Lewin received an orthodox Jewish education at home. He was one of four children born into a middle-class family. His father owned a small general store, and the family lived in an apartment above the store. His father, Leopold, operated a farm jointly with his brother Max; however, the farm was legally owned by a Christian because Jews were not permitted to own farms at the time. The family moved to Berlin in 1905, so Lewin and his brothers could receive a better education. From 1905 to 1908, Lewin studied at the Kaiserin Augusta Gymnasium, where he received a classical humanistic education. In 1909, he entered the University of Freiburg to study medicine, but transferred to the University of Munich to study biology. He became involved with the socialist movement and women's rights around this time. In April 1910, he transferred to the Royal Friedrich-Wilhelms University of Berlin, where he was still a medical student. By the Easter semester of 1911, his interests had shifted toward philosophy. By the summer of 1911, the majority of his courses were in psychology. While at the University of Berlin, Lewin took 14 courses with Carl Stumpf (1848–1936). He served in the German army when World War I began. Due to a war wound, he returned to the University of Berlin to complete his PhD. Lewin wrote a dissertation proposal asking Stumpf to be his supervisor, and Stumpf assented. Even though Lewin worked under Stumpf to complete his dissertation, their relationship did not involve much communication. Lewin studied associations, will, and intention for his dissertation, but he did not discuss it with Stumpf until his final doctoral examination. In 1917, Lewin married Maria Landsberg. In 1919, the couple had a daughter Esther Agnes, and in 1922, their son Fritz Reuven was born. They divorced around 1927, and Maria immigrated to Palestine with the children. In 1929, Lewin married Gertrud Weiss. Their daughter Miriam was born in 1931, and their son Daniel was born in 1933. Lewin had originally been involved with schools of behavioral psychology before changing directions in research and undertaking work with psychologists of the Gestalt school of psychology, including Max Wertheimer and Wolfgang Kohler. He also joined the Psychological Institute of the University of Berlin where he lectured and gave seminars on both philosophy and psychology. He served as a professor at the University of Berlin from 1926 to 1932, during which time he conducted experiments about tension states, needs, motivation, and learning. In 1933, Lewin had tried to negotiate a teaching position as the chair of psychology as well as the creation of a research institute at the Hebrew University. Lewin often associated with the early Frankfurt School, originated by an influential group of largely Jewish Marxists at the Institute for Social Research in Germany. But when Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933 the Institute members had to disband, moving to England and then to America. In that year, he met with Eric Trist, of the London Tavistock Clinic. Trist was impressed with his theories and went on to use them in his studies on soldiers during the Second World War. Lewin immigrated to the United States in August 1933 and became a naturalized citizen in 1940. A few years after relocating to America, Lewin began asking people to pronounce his name as ""Lou-in"" rather than ""Le-veen"" because the mispronunciation of his name by Americans had led to many missed phone calls. However, shortly before his death, he began requesting students and colleagues to use the correct pronunciation (""Le-veen"") because that is the one he preferred. Earlier, he had spent six months as a visiting professor at Stanford in 1930, but on his immigration to the United States, Lewin worked at Cornell University and for the Iowa Child Welfare Research Station at the University of Iowa. Later, he became director of the Center for Group Dynamics at MIT. Following World War II, Lewin was involved in the psychological rehabilitation of former occupants of displaced persons camps with Dr. Jacob Fine at Harvard Medical School. When Trist and A T M Wilson wrote to Lewin proposing a journal in partnership with their newly founded Tavistock Institute and his group at MIT, Lewin agreed. The Tavistock journal, Human Relations, was founded with two early papers by Lewin entitled ""Frontiers in Group Dynamics"". Lewin taught for a time at Duke University. Lewin died in Newtonville, Massachusetts, of heart failure in 1947. He was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His wife died in 1987. Lewin coined the notion of genidentity, which has gained some importance in various theories of space-time and related fields. For instance, he introduced the concept of hodological space or the simplest route achieved through the resolution of different field of forces, oppositions, and tensions according to their goals. Lewin also proposed Herbert Blumer's interactionist perspective of 1937 as an alternative to the nature versus nurture debate. Lewin suggested that neither nature (inborn tendencies) nor nurture (how experiences in life shape individuals) alone can account for individuals' behavior and personalities, but rather that both nature and nurture interact to shape each person. This idea was presented in the form of Lewin's equation for behavior, B = ƒ(P, E), which means that behavior (B) is a function (f) of personal characteristics (P), and environmental characteristics (E). First and foremost, Kurt Lewin was an applied researcher and practical theorist. Most scholars of the time reveled in the fear that devoting oneself to applied research would distract the discipline from basic research on scholarly problems – thus creating this false binary regarding for whom knowledge is created, whether it was for the perpetuation of the discipline or for application. Despite this debate within the social sciences at the time, Lewin argued that ""applied research could be conducted with rigor and that one could test theoretical propositions in applied research."" The root of this particular binary seemed to stem from the epistemological norms present within the hard sciences – where the distinction was much more pronounced; Kurt Lewin argued that this was contrary to the nature of the social sciences. Furthermore, with the help of scholars like Paul Lazarsfeld, there was a method through which money could be acquired for research in a sustainable manner. Lewin has encouraged researchers to develop theories that can be used to address important social problems. To demonstrate his dedication to applied research and to further prove that there was value in testing his theoretical propositions, Lewin became a ""master at transposing an everyday problem into a psychological experiment"". Lewin, in his beginnings, took a seemingly banal moment between himself and a waiter and turned it into the beginnings of his field research. In this particular incident, Lewin reasoned that the ""intention to carry out a specific task builds a psychological tension, which is released when the intended task is completed"" in tandem with when Sigmund Freud theorized that ""wishes persist until they are satisfied."" This happenstance observation started the demonstration of the ""existence of psychic tensions"", fundamental to Lewin's field theory. While applied research helped develop Lewin into a practical theorist, what further defined him as an academic and a forerunner was his action research – a term he invented himself. Lewin was increasingly interested in the concepts of Jewish migration and identity. He was confused by the concept of how while an individual distanced themselves from performing the Jewish identity in terms of religious expression and performance, they were still considered Jewish in the eyes of Nazis. This concept of denying one's identity and the promotion of self-loathing as a form of coping with a dominant group's oppression represented the crisis of Lewin's own migration to the United States. Lewin, as his student and colleague Ron Lippitt described, ""had a deep sensitivity to social problems and a commitment to use his resources as a social scientist to do something about them. Thus in the early 1940s he drew a triangle to represent the interdependence of research, training, and action in producing social change."" This diagramming of an academic's interests and actions within this triangulation yields an interesting part of accessing Lewin and his contributions. Rather than noting social justice as the beginning or the end, it was ingrained in every single academic action that Lewin took. It was this particular world view and paradigm that furthered his research and determined precisely how he was going to utilize the findings from his field research. Furthermore, it all reflected upon Lewin the man and his way of coping with the events of his time period. This devotion to action research was possibly a way of resolving a dissonance of his own passage to America and how he left his own back in present-day Poland. Prominent psychologists mentored by Lewin included Leon Festinger (1919–1989), who became known for his cognitive dissonance theory (1956), environmental psychologist Roger Barker, Bluma Zeigarnik, and Morton Deutsch, the founder of modern conflict resolution theory and practice. Force-field analysis provides a framework for looking at the factors (""forces"") that influence a situation, originally social situations. It looks at forces that are either driving movement toward a goal (helping forces) or blocking movement toward a goal (hindering forces). Key to this approach was Lewin's interest in gestaltism, understanding the totality and assessing a situation as a whole and not focusing only on individual aspects. Further, the totality for an individual (their life space) derives from their perception of their reality, not an objective viewpoint. The approach, developed by Kurt Lewin, is a significant contribution to the fields of social science, psychology, social psychology, organizational development, process management, and change management. His theory was expanded by John R. P. French who related it to organizational and industrial settings. Lewin, then a professor at MIT, first coined the term action research in about 1944, and it appears in his 1946 paper ""Action Research and Minority Problems"". In that paper, he described action research as ""a comparative research on the conditions and effects of various forms of social action and research leading to social action"" that uses ""a spiral of steps, each of which is composed of a circle of planning, action, and fact-finding about the result of the action"" (this is sometimes referred to as the Lewinian spiral). Lewin often characterized organizational management styles and cultures in terms of leadership climates defined by (1) authoritarian, (2) democratic and (3) laissez-faire work environments. He is often confused with McGregor with his work environments, but McGregor adapted them directly to leadership-theory. Authoritarian environments are characterized where the leader determines policy with techniques and steps for work tasks dictated by the leader in the division of labor. The leader is not necessarily hostile but is aloof from participation in work and commonly offers personal praise and criticism for the work done. Democratic climates are characterized where policy is determined through collective processes with decisions assisted by the leader. Before accomplishing tasks, perspectives are gained from group discussion and technical advice from a leader. Members are given choices and collectively decide the division of labor. Praise and criticism in such an environment are objective, fact minded and given by a group member without necessarily having participated extensively in the actual work. Laissez-faire environments give freedom to the group for policy determination without any participation from the leader. The leader remains uninvolved in work decisions unless asked, does not participate in the division of labor, and very infrequently gives praise.: 39–40 An early model of change developed by Lewin described change as a three-stage process. The first stage he called ""unfreezing"". It involved overcoming inertia and dismantling the existing ""mind set"". It must be part of surviving. Defense mechanisms have to be bypassed. In the second stage the change occurs. This is typically a period of confusion and transition. We are aware that the old ways are being challenged but we do not have a clear picture as to what we are replacing them with yet. The third and final stage he called ""freezing"". The new mindset is crystallizing and one's comfort level is returning to previous levels. This is often misquoted as ""refreezing"" (see Lewin,1947). Lewin's three-step process is regarded as a foundational model for making change in organizations. There is now evidence, however, that Lewin never developed such a model and that it took form after his death in 1947. While working at MIT in 1946, Lewin received a phone call from the director of the Connecticut State Inter Racial Commission requesting help to find an effective way to combat religious and racial prejudices. He set up a workshop to conduct a ""change"" experiment, which laid the foundations for what is now known as sensitivity training. In 1947, this led to the establishment of the National Training Laboratories, at Bethel, Maine. Carl Rogers believed that sensitivity training is ""perhaps the most significant social invention of this century."" Lewin's equation, B = ƒ(P, E), is a psychological equation of behavior developed by Kurt Lewin. It states that behavior is a function of the person in their environment. The equation is the psychologist's most well known formula in social psychology, of which Lewin was a modern pioneer. When first presented in Lewin's book Principles of Topological Psychology, published in 1936, it contradicted most popular theories in that it gave importance to a person's momentary situation in understanding his or her behavior, rather than relying entirely on the past. In a 1947 article, Lewin coined the term ""group dynamics"". He described this notion as the way that groups and individuals act and react to changing circumstances. This field emerged as a concept dedicated to the advancement of knowledge regarding the nature of groups, their laws, establishment, development, and interactions with other groups, individuals and institutions. During the early years of research on group processes, many psychologists rejected the reality of group phenomena. Critics shared the opinion that groups did not exist as scientifically valid entities. It had been said by skeptics that the actions of groups were nothing more than those of its members considered separately. Lewin applied his interactionism formula, B = ƒ(P, E), to explain group phenomena, where a member's personal characteristics (P) interact with the environmental factors of the group, (E) its members, and the situation to elicit behaviour (B). Given his background in Gestalt psychology, Lewin justified group existence using the dictum ""The whole is greater than the sum of its parts"". He theorized that when a group is established it becomes a unified system with supervening qualities that cannot be understood by evaluating members individually. This notion – that a group is composed of more than the sum of its individual members – quickly gained support from sociologists and psychologists who understood the significance of this emerging field. Many pioneers noted that the majority of group phenomena could be explained according to Lewin's equation and insight and opposing views were hushed. The study of group dynamics remains relevant in today's society where a vast number of professions (e.g., business and industry, clinicalcounseling psychology, sports and recreation) rely on its mechanisms to thrive. The most notable of Lewin's contributions was his development of group communication and group dynamics as major facets of the communication discipline. Lewin and his associated researchers shifted from the pre-existing trend of individualist psychology and then expanded their work to incorporate a macro lens where they focused on the ""social psychology of small group communication"" (Rogers 1994). Lewin is associated with ""founding research and training in group dynamics and for establishing the participative management style in organizations"". He carved out this niche for himself from his various experiments. In his Berlin research, Lewin utilized ""group discussions to advance his theory in research."" In doing so, there was certainly the complication of not knowing exactly whom to attribute epiphanies to as an idea collectively came into fruition. In addition to group discussions, he became increasingly interested in group membership. He was curious as to how perspectives of an individual in relation to the group were solidified or weakened. He tried to come up with the way identity was constructed from standpoint and perspectives. These were the beginnings of what ended up developing into ""groupthink"". Lewin started to become quite interested in how ideas were created and then perpetuated by the mentality of a group. Not included in this chapter is how important this became in looking at group dynamics across disciplines – including studying John F Kennedy and the way he tried to interact with his advisors in order to prevent groupthink from occurring. Lewin conceived the Peach v Coconut cultural distinction. Peach cultures include India, USA, and most of Latin America plus southern Europe. Peaches tend to be soft and friendly on the surface, even with strangers, but have a hard protective inner core. Coconut cultures include China, Russia and most of Europe except the south. Folk from coconut cultures have a soft inner core, but a tough exterior than can lead to a perception of unfriendliness with strangers. Yet once a person has gained their trust, they can be loyal friends for life. The Peach v Coconut analogy was later popularised by Fons Trompenaars, who said it ""explains all sorts of animosities that bedevil cross-cultural friendships, business dealings and diplomacy.""",Normal
"Diplocynodon is an extinct genus of alligatoroid crocodilian that lived during the Paleocene to Middle Miocene in Europe. Some species may have reached lengths of 3 metres (9.8ft), while others probably did not exceed 1 metre (3.3ft). They are almost exclusively found in freshwater environments. The various species are thought to have been opportunistic aquatic predators. In the nineteenth century, D. steineri was named from Styria, Austria and D. styriacus was named from Austria and France. A third Austrian species, Enneodon ungeri, was placed in its own genus. The Austrian and French species of Diplocynodon were synonymized with E. ungeri in 2011, and because the name Diplocynodon has priority over Enneodon, the species is now called D. ungeri. Other genera have recently been found to be synonymous with Diplocynodon. Hispanochampsa muelleri of Spain was determined to be synonymous with Diplocynodon in 2006, and Baryphracta deponaie of Germany was confirmed to be synonymous with Diplocynodon in 2012. Well preserved specimens have been found in the Messel Pit and the Geiseltal lignite deposit in Germany. Most articulated Diplocynodon specimens from these localities contain gastroliths. In the Eocene epoch, the German sites were either a swampy freshwater lake (Messel Pit) or a peat bog swamp (Geiseltal).

"Vivian Helena Pellizari is a Brazilian Antarctic scientist known for her work on establishing Antarctic microbiology in Brazil. Pellizari is the head of Department of Oceanographic Biology at Oceanographic Institute of University of São Paulo. Pellizari received her master's degree in 1992 from the University of São Paulo (USP), Brazil. At the beginning of her PhD she contacted the Oceanographic Institute at University of São Paulo with the first proposal to for Brazilian Antarctic Program covering microbial ecology goals. She then obtained her PhD in 1996 in Biological Sciences (Microbiology) from the University of São Paulo. The title of her thesis was “Phenotypic and molecular aspects of bacteria isolated from the environment and involved in biodegradation Biphenyls (PCBs)"". She spent 1 year as a postdoctoral researcher at Center for Microbial Ecology at Michigan State University in the Tiedje Lab. Pellizari’s research focuses on extremophiles, microbiology, and marine microbial ecology in different Antarctic ecosystems. Pellizari has also contributed to the formation of new Antarctic research areas in Latin America including astrobiology, genomics of extremophiles and molecular microbial ecology. She is part of a consortium addressing the topic Aerobiology Over Antarctica, and was part of the National Institute of Science and technology – Antarctic Environmental Research INCT –APA and support projects related with Brazilian National Institute of cryospheric science and technology . Pellizari is the head of Department of Oceanographic Biology at Oceanographic Institute (IO) of University of São Paulo and a member of the scientific committee of Center of Antarctica Research (CPA) at University of São Paulo. The Oceanographic Institute was a pioneer in Antarctic expeditions, being part of the Brazilian Antarctic Program since the first expedition in 1982. Pellizari has been part of the program since 1996 and first worked in Antarctica in 1997. In 2005, after 6 years in the Antarctic Program she organized a network of microbiologists, called the MicroPolar Network, to improve the microbial ecology research in Antarctica. This was created in 2005 under the umbrella of the Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR). The MicroPolar Network is coordinated by Pellizari and includes more than 15 professors and their teams from seven different Universities.

"The 1962 24 Hours of Le Mans was a motor race for Experimental cars and Grand Touring cars, staged at the Circuit de la Sarthe, Le Mans, France on 23 and 24 June 1962. It was the 30th Grand Prix of Endurance and the eighth round of the 1962 International Championship of Manufacturers. The race was won by Olivier Gendebien and Phil Hill driving a Ferrari 330 TRILM. The CSI (Commission Sportive Internationale - the FIA’s regulations body) initiated its new championship aimed specifically for GT cars. The International Championship of Manufacturers was expanded to fifteen races, including endurance and short races and hill-climbs, open to all or some of the eligible classes. However the Le Mans organisers, the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO), realised the public popularity of the Sports Car category and formulated their own development of the existing rules. The aim was to encourage prototypes of potential future GT designs. The maximum engine size for those cars (now called ‘Experimental’) was lifted from 3 to 4 litres. This approach was adopted by the four major endurance events (Sebring, Targa Florio, Nürburgring and Le Mans) who combined to create the Challenge Mondial de Vitesse et Endurance (Speed World Challenge) within the FIA championship that lasted to 1974. The ACO's ideas had the desired effect and there were 79 applications for the race to be reduced to 60 cars to practice for the 55 starting places. Aside from Ferrari and Maserati, a number of companies arrived with new prototypes including Aston Martin, Tojeiro, TVR, Abarth and OSCA. The CSI windscreen rules were influencing design, favouring closed-cars, and only 6 of the 55 starters were open-top. There were 28 ‘works’ entries. Four-car teams came from Ferrari, Abarth and Panhard et Levassor. Most other works and privateer teams brought 3-car teams. Again, Ferrari was the dominant marque in the race with 18 entries – the biggest representation from any marque at a Le Mans. Sports-car specialist Abarth was next with 9 cars. SEFAC Ferrari had bounced back from the chaos at the end of 1961, when top designer Carlo Chiti led a walkout of key staff from the company. His last design, the new 330 TRILM was finished by Mauro Forghieri. This last front-engined Ferrari sports car had a 4-litre V12 developing a mighty 390bhp. It was given to Ferrari's best endurance pair, Phil Hill and Olivier Gendebien. The same engine was also fitted into an updated version of the 250 GTO (Chassis No. 3765), the 330 LMB to be driven by Mike Parkes and Lorenzo Bandini. Ferrari also arrived with two variations of its successful mid-engine cars, the 246 SP V6 for the fan-favourite Rodriguez brothers, and the 268 SP V8 for Ludovico Scarfiotti Giancarlo Baghetti. The previous year's TRI61 cars were sold, one each, to the two Ferrari customer teams: the North American Racing Team (NART) who also had a non-standard 250 GT that had to enter the ‘Experimental’ category. The other went to Italian Count Giovanni Volpi’s Scuderia Serenissima team. However, the count had incurred Enzo Ferrari’s wrath by hiring Chiti and his fellows and could no longer buy Ferrari cars. He therefore got Chiti to redesign a 250 GT with large aerodynamic back end. Nicknamed the ‘breadvan’ its low profile made it very fast, and it was given to Carlo Maria Abate and Colin Davis. Bucking the trend of moving toward mid-engined cars, the new Maserati T151 was a front-engined 3.9-litre V8 generating 360bhp and an aerodynamic Kamm tail. Four were entered, including two for Briggs Cunningham and the new Maserati France team. They proved to be the fastest cars on the straights, reaching 287kph (180mph). However they lost time to the better-handling Ferraris through the curves. Aston Martin returned to Le Mans with a new prototype based on its DB4 – the Project 212. John Wyer, the team manager and mastermind behind their 1959 Le Mans win was now the company's CEO. The 4-litre Straight-6 engine developed 330bhp and pushed the car to 270kph (170mph) down the Mulsanne straight. The car would be raced by Masten Gregory and Graham Hill. Le Mans regulars, the Ecurie Ecosse team, got John Tojeiro to build them a pair of coupés, utilising a mid-mounted 2.5-litre Coventry Climax F1 engine. The chassis were barely finished in time, and were dispatched to Le Mans unpainted. When the transporter had a traffic accident in Kent en route, it damaged the ready car, so the team chose to scratch the unassembled car. In the middle-sized engine classes, there was only a single entry from TVR, the small British sports-car manufacturer, in the 2-litre class. A similar British company, Marcos, was in the 1.6-litre class against a pair of OSCA 1600GTs. The 1300cc class was solely contested by five Abarth coupés, now powered by 125bhp SIMCA engines. In the smallest classes there was a remarkable change to the entry list from the previous years. Abarth augmented their larger cars with standard 700cc Fiat-engined cars. After the break-up of the Deutsch et Bonnet partnership, Panhard and Bonnet arrived with new cars. Charles Deutsch stayed with Panhard power for the returning works team, while René Bonnet presented his new Djet with Renault engines. At the recent race at a wet Nürburgring, Colin Chapman’s Lotus 23 driven by Jim Clark had led the whole field. He entered two such cars for Index honours, but was stymied at scrutineering because the front and rear wheels had different numbers of wheel studs. The officials said the compulsory spare wheel therefore could not be universally applied. Chapman pulled the entries and swore he would never return to Le Mans – and never did. As with previous years, the GT division was dominated by Ferrari cars. As well as three of the 250 GT, there were five of the stunning new 250 GTO entered by customer teams. It carried the 3-litre engine from the Testarossa sports car. Although the GT regulations stipulated that 100 examples had to have been built, Ferrari was able to convince the authorities that it was actually a derivation of an existing model - the 250 GT. Permitted under the rules loophole, it could use that production record to get homologation (the ‘O’ in ‘GTO’). The previous year's Jaguar E2A prototype had now been homologated as the ‘E-type’ and there were three such cars entered, including Briggs Cunningham’s team again. Cunningham was co-driven by Le Mans race-winner Roy Salvadori because he could not fit into Brigg's Maserati cars. As well as an Austin-Healey 3000, there were also a pair of Aston Martin DB4s including a return from Frenchman Jean Kerguen. The biggest car in the field was the private American-entry Chevrolet Corvette, virtually stock with its 327 cu in (5.4-litre) Stingray engine modified to produce 360bhp. In the 2-litre GT class, the Morgan Plus 4 works car was entered again after being rejected in the previous year for looking too old-fashioned. The Super Sport version had an uprated Triumph engine produce 115bhp and capable of 120mph (190kmh). The 1.6-litre class was to be a battle between three Porsche-Abarths (Porsche 356 B Carrera GTL Abarth, also referred to as Porsche 695 GS Abarth) and three works Sunbeams. Porsche had decided not to enter their new Flat-8 in the Experimental class. In the 1.3-litre class it was between the Elites of Team Lotus and the Alfa Romeo Giuliettas of the Scuderia St Ambroeus. Once again, the public roads were closed to allow a test weekend on 7–8 April, which 33 entrants availed themselves of. Fastest time was put down by Willy Mairesse in the Ferrari 250 GT SWB, doing a 4:07.1, quicker than his time in the new GTO of 4:10.8. On race-week, in the Wednesday evening practice Phil Hill, Ferrari's F1 world champion, broke Mike Hawthorn’s longstanding lap record from 1957 by over two seconds (3:55.1). Mike Parkes in the GTO prototype was second fastest (3:58.6), then came Thompson in the Cunningham Maserati (3:59.1), the Aston Martin of Graham Hill (3:59.8), McLaren’s Maserati (4:01.3) and Pedro Rodriguez in the Ferrari (4:02.2). By contrast the Bianchi’s new Abarth-Simca recorded a 4:34.3. The only serious incident was when Robert Bouharde crashed his small Bonnet Djet at Maison Blanche, destroying the car. He was taken to hospital with a knee injury. Saturday was fine and sunny. This year Maurice Baumgartner, new President of the CSI, was the honorary starter. Graham Hill was the first under the Dunlop Bridge but got into a drag race down the long straight with Parkes in the GTO prototype. With both cars braking late, the Aston Martin punted the Ferrari off into the sandtrap at Mulsanne corner, immediately costing him many laps. On the second lap Gendebien managed to pass Hill cleanly on the straight. On the third lap the TVR became the first retirement when Peter Bolton pitted with all his water gone, long before any replenishment was permitted. So for the first hour the big Ferrari led Hill from the three Maseratis of Kimberley, Trintignant and McLaren. Pedro Rodriguez had initially got up to third before slipping back to sixth. Then came the Ferraris of Gurney, Baghetti, Abate’s ‘breadvan’ and Guichet's GTO leading the GT division in tenth. But the better handling and fuel economy of the Ferrari got the Mexican brothers back to second as the pit stops rotated. Pushing Phil Hill hard (he broke Hawthorn's 1957 race lap record in the third hour) they hit the front in the third hour. The other Ferrari of ScarfiottiBaghetti slotted into a secure third place. Count Volpi's ‘breadvan’ Ferrari had been running 7th, leading the other GTOs when it was stopped by a broken propshaft in the 3rd hour. After running in fourth for the first three hours, a faulty dynamo on the Aston Martin necessitated a number of pit-stops, taking it out of the running and it finally retired before midnight. The three Maseratis stayed in contact, taking the lead briefly on fuel-stop strategies. Dick Thompson was the first Maserati to falter (about 8.30pm) when he spun at the Esses with new brake pads, swiping the rear and rupturing his oil-tank. McLaren's Maserati had got into second but threw a tyre-tread that dropped it a number of places. Mike Parkes’ trip to the sandtrap eventually killed the 330 LMB's radiator and they were retired after 10pm. The two Ferraris swapped the lead throughout the night, thrilling the huge crowd with close racing. Third, and two laps back, was the Scarfiotti Ferrari then the leading GTO, of Noblet. The French Maserati had been running 7th but retired about 2am after an earlier spin on oil had left the suspension dangerously off-balance. The Maserati challenge finally died out when the second Cunningham car, of HansgenMcLaren running 6th, retired in the 12th hour when its differential packed up. The Ecosse Tojeiro had been running midfield until just before 11pm when Tom Dickson suddenly found himself coasting in neutral in the fast section approaching Maison Blanche. It was several dangerous minutes, with cars racing past in the darkness before marshals were able to assist pushing the car off the track to safety. The big Chevrolet V8 had likewise been running midfield but soon after the halfway mark Jack Turner accidentally put the car into reverse at the Mulsanne corner. Destroying the gearbox it was left with only third gear and the constant hi-revs soon broke the fuel injection. For once a dry night dawned into a sunny day. Only 33 of the 55 starters were still running. Things were falling Ferrari's way until at 4.45am the Rodriguez car suddenly broke its final drive. This finally allowed Hill & Gendebien to ease off and rest a potentially troublesome clutch. There was still drama for Gendebien though when he narrowly missed a big accident with a backmarker that was stopped in the middle of the road after spinning in the dawn light. Three hours later the other Ferrari also retired on the Mulsanne straight, with a broken clutch. This moved up the new Ferrari GTOs onto the podium: Pierre Noblet's privateer entry ahead of the NART modified-GTO of GrossmanRoberts and the Equipe Nationale Belge car of “Beurlys””Eldé”. The two remaining Jaguar E-types were next, the British privateers keeping four laps ahead of Briggs Cunningham. In a race-long duel the leading, HerrmannBarth, Porsche 2-litre GT had been chasing the smaller 1.2-litre Lotus Elite of HobbsGardner. Both had steadily moved up the field through the night and got into the top-10 during the morning. Then the Lotus dropped onto three cylinders allowing the Porsche to overtake it. Positions remained relatively static for the last four hours, excepting the American Ferrari that slipped to sixth with starter-motor problems. Hill and Gendebien finished a comfortable 5 laps ahead of the Frenchmen. NobletGuichet improved from their 3rd-place from the previous year, winning the GT division and finishing a clear 12 laps ahead of the Belgian GTO. The rest of the field has clusters of close finishes: In the last hour, Cunningham's Jaguar finally managed to get past their British rivals and finished 4th. Peter Sargent's car had a broken engine mount then its gearbox got jammed in top gear but were able to nurse the car home. In the end, Herrmann and Barth had a strong finish in the Porsche, despite a failing gearbox, and pushed up to finish 7th, less than a lap ahead of the recovering Lotus. Chapman was thrilled to be able to win the Index of Thermal Efficiency (achieving over 20mpg), sharing the prize with the DuboisHarris Abarth-Simca. In the battle for the Index of Performance between the French Panhard, Renault and SIMCA, victory went to the sole-surviving CD-Panhard of GuilhardinBertaut. In a close finish they just beat two of the new Bonnet-Renault Djets. The ‘old-fashioned’ Morgan soldiered on throughout and after their sole competition Equipe Chardonnet AC Ace retired after only four hours, the finished 13th and claimed the GT 2-litre class win. Even though only four of their 15 starters made it to the finish, the win made Ferrari the most successful marque at Le Mans, with six wins, ahead of Jaguar's and Bentley's five. As it turned out, it would be the last win for a front-engined car. His fourth win made Olivier Gendebien became the most successful driver at Le Mans – until the arrival of the legendary Jacky Ickx at the end of the decade. That success, and the near miss he had at dawn, convinced him to promptly announce his retirement while on a highpoint. This was the last Le Mans for OSCA – in 1963 the Maserati brothers sold the company to Count Domenico Agusta, owner of the motorcycle company MV Agusta. Likewise, this was the last hurrah for the original Ecurie Ecosse team, who had won the race outright in 1956 and 1957 with the Jaguar D-type. Over several years, the young Mexican Rodriguez brothers had excited the crowd with their fast, competitive driving. The younger brother, Ricardo, was killed in November in practice for the non-championship Mexican Grand Prix. He was 20 years old. Paul Armagnac, twice a winner of the Performance Index for DB, had recently built a new circuit at Nogaro in south-western France. This was his last of eight Le Mans as he too was killed at the end of the year, at Montlhèry.

Precipitation is abundant throughout the year. The average annual temperature in Tsuwano is 14.3°C (57.7°F). The average annual rainfall is 1,908.3mm (75.13in) with July as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.3°C (79.3°F), and lowest in January, at around 3.0°C (37.4°F). The highest temperature ever recorded in Tsuwano was 38.2°C (100.8°F) on 14 August 2018; the coldest temperature ever recorded was −13.1°C (8.4°F) on 28 February 1981. Per Japanese census data, the population of Tsuwano in 2020 is 6,875 people. Tsuwano has been conducting censuses since 1920. The area of Tsuwano was part of ancient Iwami Province. During the Edo Period, the town developed as the jōkamachi of Tsuwano Domain, which was ruled by the Kamei clan for most of its history. In 1868, it was the site of particular gruesome persecutions of Kakure Kirishitan, who had been exiled to this location after their discovery and arrest in the Urakami Yoban Kuzure. After the Meiji restoration, the town of Tsuwano was established on within Kanoashi District, Shimane on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. On September 25, 2005 the town of Nichihara was merged into Tsuwano. Tsuwano has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 12 members.

In terms of national politics, the town is part of the Shimane 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan. Tsuwano is a very rural area, with an economy based on agriculture and forestry. Tourism also plays a very important factor in the local economy. As it is close to Yamaguchi Prefecture, many tourists who come to Tsuwano also visit Hagi on the Sea of Japan and Yamaguchi at the same time, and Tsuwano is often mistaken as being in Yamaguchi prefecture.

"In Singapore, language planning is associated with government planning. In this top-down approach, the government influences the acquisition of languages and their respective functions within the speech community through the education system. Language planning aims to facilitate effective communication within the speech community, which can result in a language shift or language assimilation. The goals of language planning are very much dependent on the political and social forces present in Singapore during two distinct periods: Colonisation by the British and the Post-Independence period after 1965. Singapore is a linguistically and ethnically diverse country with a population of about 5.7 million. Officially, its ethnic composition is approximately 76.8% Chinese, 13.9% Malay, 7.9% Indian, while the remaining 1.4% are mainly Others, a miscellaneous category. Given this diversity, the language policy in Singapore aims at cultivating amongst its citizens a bilingual proficiency in the English language and a mother tongue that is officially assigned to the specific ethnic communities. Although the English language is excluded from the list of official mother tongues (Mandarin, Bahasa Melayu, Tamil), it is still recognised as an official language for practical reasons such as ensuring socio-economic mobility. This is because the ethnically neutral status of English helps to ensure that the distribution of economic advantages is not seen as unduly privileging or benefiting a specific ethnic group, which would otherwise raise the danger of inter-ethnic tension. Additionally, the English language represents the idea of 'modernity' and its association with progress, science, technology and capitalism. After political independence in 1959, the Singapore Government officially accepted Malay as the national Language of Singapore. However, its importance gradually declined as a result of the social, political and economic developments that had taken place. When vernacular schools were closed in 1987, the Ministry of Education implemented the National System of Education. The Bilingual Policy encourages Singaporeans to be proficient in both the English language, and in their respective ethnic mother tongues, which include Chinese Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. Bilingual education is provided by the Ministry of Education in Singapore. The Bilingual Policy also aims to promote better understanding amongst the three ethnic groups in line with the effort of nation building. Additionally, there was also the growing concern that Singapore was facing increasing Western influences, effecting a potential threat of the de-Asianisation or de-culturalisation of the people. Due to the increasing importance of English as an international language, many Singaporeans have started to pay more attention to the learning of the English language and focus less on the learning of their own mother tongue. The Bilingual Policy was then enacted to safeguard Asian identities and values. Alongside English, the Singapore Government aims to promote Mandarin Chinese, Malay and Tamil so as to prevent the erosion of culture and heritage of the three ethnic groups Racial harmony is a stated policy of the Singaporean government, and a racial harmony day is even celebrated. Usage of four official languages is an element of policy designed to promote racial harmony, as is bilingualism in accordance with the belief that the ethnic language is the ""carrier of culture"" while English is the ""language of commerce"", a choice motivated by the fact that English had historically been the language of the colonial administration, while being the native language of few Singaporeans at the time of the policy's implementation. With English as the lingua franca, no one ethnicity is favored, but the cultures are preserved. The idea behind this policy is that treating all languages as standard and thus equally prestigious will result in the speakers of each language being treated equally. While the Singaporean government promotes Standard Singapore English as a lingua franca, it heavily discourages the usage of Singlish, a Chinese- and Malay-influenced, English-based creole language, widely spoken by Singaporeans, but virtually unintelligible to foreign speakers of English. Governments including those of Lee Hsien Loong, Lee Kuan Yew, and Goh Chok Tong have campaigned against the usage of Singlish, declaring it an obstacle to communication with the rest of the English-speaking world, and a substandard, ""broken English"", that ought not be part of Singapore's identity. A Speak Good English campaign aims ""to encourage Singaporeans to speak grammatically correct English that is universally understood"", while urging citizens to purge Singlish from their speech. In line with government policy, schools emphasize standard English, and try to minimise the usage of Singlish in the classroom, holding that Singlish hinders the learning of ""proper"" English. The Media Development Authority, a statutory board of the government, urges Singaporean mass media to use as little Singlish as possible, declaring it appropriate only for ""interviews, where the interviewee speaks only Singlish"". Despite these policies, however, the usage of Singlish outside formal, institutional contexts remains widespread. The Singaporean government also promotes a single, standardised form of Chinese, discouraging the usage of other Chinese varieties. While the Chinese community of Singapore historically spoke several varieties of Chinese, most of them mutually unintelligible, such as Cantonese, Teochew, and Hokkien, the government has promoted Standard Mandarin, both as a means of unifying Chinese Singaporeans under a common language, and to facilitate communication with Chinese people from outside Singapore. Since 1979, the Speak Mandarin Campaign has promoted use of Mandarin. There were two prominent language ideologies that the Singapore government adopted: After independence, the Singapore government gave English Language, Mandarin Chinese, Malay Language and Tamil Language shared official status. The Singapore government attempts to shun away from linguistic assimilation, as it believes it must acknowledge the need to embrace the co-existence of the four official languages in the context of a multi-racial Singapore. Status Planning suggests that a particular language or variety may be chosen for specific purposes and given official status. This may result in a language policy which is a product of language planning, and can be comprehended within the discourse of language politics and society, or the more informal but powerful political and social aspects of language planning. In this view, one can argue that language status planning issues are related to political issues as status planning focuses on legislative decisions that affect the reallocation of language functions. Language status can also mean the position or standing of a language vis-à-vis other languages. The Singapore Government recognises the importance of the English language for a multi-racial society and therefore it has been attributed the status of an official language and a de facto national language. The government has been active in promoting status planning in Singapore. One of the most distinct changes in the linguistic landscape of Singapore after independence was promoting the status of the English language. This is done by allocating resources to develop English in various functional domains such as the government, law, business, administration, and in particular, the medium of instruction in schools—even though time is allocated for the learning of Mother tongue languages. English is the international lingua franca, it was no longer viewed as a colonial language but rather an international language permitting universal communication. The economic rewards of being proficient in English was emphasised upon perpetuating the mindset that English is the superior language in Singapore. Besides government administrative domains where English is widely practised, English has gradually been inculcated into social, family and individual habitats as well. Despite the government's attempt to maintain symbolic and cultural capital in the Mother tongues, English has been deeply integrated into the local linguistic landscape of Singapore. It is evident that English has acquired a significant role in the linguistic landscape of Singapore, as Singapore is the only (non-native speaker) country which has adopted English as a working language, short of Singapore, no other country has channelled its language policies into churning out a population that is bi-literate in English and another official language. The Speak Good English Movement is a government-initiated campaign The Singapore government sees Singlish as a variety whose increasing popularity might threaten the ability of Singaporeans to acquire competence in 'good' English. The latter is prized as a linguistic resource in a world of global economic competition, and the government fears that the presence of Singlish might actually undermine English language proficiency. This led the government, in 2000, to initiate the Speak Good English Movement (SGEM). On 15 August 1999, The Sunday Times reported Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first Prime Minister, commented on Singlish as a 'handicap': Those Singaporeans who can speak good English should help to create a good environment for speaking English, rather than advocate, as some do, the use of Singlish… Singlish is a handicap we must not wish on Singaporeans. While the Speak Good English Movement has seen progress through its engagement via radio shows, on television programmes, and in giving out the 'Inspiring Teacher of English' award, it has controversy as well. Despite the government's label of Singlish as a 'handicap', the latter endorsed the usage of Singlish on more than one occasion. When the SARS crisis broke out in 2003, the Singapore government commissioned a SARS rap song (sometimes known as the ""SAR-vivor Rap"") to emphasise the importance of proper hygiene. The lyrics of the SARS rap song are heavily Singlish, containing terms such as ""lah"", ""leh"", and ""kiasu"". To answer its contradictory stance, the Singapore government provided a rationale that ""Singlish was considered necessary in order to communicate with less-educated Singaporeans"". Singapore Day is a cultural-cum-cuisine-based event organised by the Prime Minister's Office Overseas Singaporean Unit. It is aimed at engaging Singaporeans residing overseas. It is held in different cities with a significant community of overseas Singaporeans. According to a report by The Sunday Times on 26 April 2009, the event made occasional use of Singlish, such as the lexical item 'chope', which is used to indicate the reservation of a seat. The intended audience there is not the 'less-educated', since most of the overseas Singaporeans are working professionals or university students pursuing a degree abroad. Acquisition Planning can be defined as the co-ordination of the language planning goals of the official parties involved in the implementation and integration of a language policy to ensure its timely and cost effective acquisition. In Singapore, the government has sole control over the acquisition planning of language. This form of language planning is often done in line with status planning. The government aims to influence aspects of the language, status, distribution and literacy through the education system. Acquisition planning is often incorporated into language planning processes in which the statuses of languages are evaluated,corpuses are revised and these revisions are implemented in society through the education system. The Curriculum Development Institute of Singapore (CDIS) was formed in 1980 as a division under the Ministry of Education. The institute had the sole task of producing teaching packages under the syllabuses prepared by the Curriculum Planning Division. In 1998, the Ministry of Education recognised a need to incorporate innovative changes to its Education system besides the current Bilingual Policy. The Ministry introduced three important national initiatives: 1)National Education, 2)Information Technology and 3)Thinking Skills, to the school curriculum The Curriculum Planning Division reduced the content of the existing syllabuses to integrate the three national initiatives into the school curriculum. Under the Bilingual Policy, all students are educated in English as their first language. The Ministry of Education ensures that the Bilingual Policy is met by students in Primary and Secondary schools- not only are they required to master English as their first language, they also have to learn their Mother Tongue as a second language. They are offered Mandarin Chinese, Malay or Tamil depending on their father's ethnicity. While English is the core language of instruction in government schools, mother tongue languages are taught on a weekly basis. While ""mother tongue"" typically correlates to the first language (L1) overseas, in Singapore, the Ministry of Education refers to it as the ""ethnic language"" or the second language (L2). Singapore's language planning is known as exogenous planning, whereby a foreign language takes on the role as the main language of communication against the indigenous languages in the country. The education system aims to create a workforce that is bi-literate in English and ChineseMalayTamil. Despite the intentions of the bilingual policy, there has been an inherent and significant shift from a predominant use of Mandarin Chinese to English within the Chinese community. The 1980 Population Census revealed that the use of Malay Language has dropped from 96.7% to 94.3%. The use of English Language in Malay households has increased from 2.3% to 5.5%. Report on the Ministry of Education, 1978: Assessment of Bilingual Policy: Formed in April 1978 and led by Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Goh Keng Swee, the Goh Report assessed the bilingual education programme in Singapore. The Ministry of Education saw its Bilingualism policy as not being universally effective. The Goh Report critiqued the Bilingual policy as ineffective bilingualism leading to the main cause of language education problems in Singapore. Although the Bilingual policy resulted in a rise in overall literacy rate, statistics reveal that less than 40% of the School-going Students had the minimum competency level in two languages at a time. Under the review of Singapore's education system: An increasing number of Singaporeans are speaking and using English at home, leading to declining standards in the command of Mother Tongue. The impact of the bilingualism policy however, differs from one ethnic group to another. Report on the Ministry of Education (1978): Assessment of Bilingual policy for three ethnic groups; The Chinese community, the Malay Community, the Indian Community The Chinese community struggled with learning two languages; English and Mandarin Chinese. When Chinese students were exposed to Mandarin Chinese in school, they felt that the language was foreign and hard to grasp. The home context did not favour the learning of Mandarin Chinese because different Chinese varieties, such as Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, Hainanese, Hakka were the dominant mode of communication at home depending on group. The Ministry of Education only allowed Mandarin Chinese in the classroom, other Chinese varieties were seen as inferior in status and were an impediment to learning Mandarin Chinese. In light of the difficulties faced by the Chinese community, the government made several amendments to the educational system to help Chinese students cope with acquiring Mandarin Chinese: Malay is valued as the means for transmitting familial and religious values. Malay is widely practised in mosques and religious schools also known as madrasah. The use of Malay language has been largely reduced to religious and classroom domains only. The increase in the number of contexts in which English is being practised has resulted in a large proportion of the Malays assimilating to English. As a result, the ML 'B' programme was introduced in 2000 to help less linguistically inclined students cope with acquiring the Malay language at oral- language proficiency levels. However, the ML 'B' programme was available only at secondary levels and was not offered at pre-university levels. Under the Bilingualism Policy, Singaporean Indians only had the option of Tamil for their Mother Tongue. Non-Tamil Indian Students were thus at a disadvantage. In recognition of this, the Ministry of Education revised the Bilingual Policy in 1989 to allow Indian Students to choose between Bengali, Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati and Urdu as their Mother Tongue. The development and implementation of the Bilingual Policy is an example of acquisition planning.The Bilingual policy places excessive demands on average students. Most students tackle two foreign languages at primary school level because most of them speak Chinese varieties at home and Mandarin Chinese is used in schools for Chinese lessons. The Ministry of Education felt that resources were not effectively employed to meet the goals of the policy. Therefore, amendments were made to allow for more flexibility and to cater to the diverse linguistic needs of the population: Under this new curriculum, the diverse needs of the students could be met and they could effectively maximise their linguistic capabilities. However, the issue of the lack of command in English was highlighted again in the ""Report for Moral Education"" in 1979. Corpus planning focuses on changes by deliberate planning to the actual corpus or shape of a language. It deals with codification, and can play a significant role in implementation and elaboration stages. Elaboration can be considered as a language task resulting in increased sophistication of the chosen code. Corpus planning is often undertaken by planners with great linguistic expertise. Corpus planning is also referred as making language planning decisions to engineer changes in the structure of a language. The Singapore Government has been active in status planning and acquisition planning however with regards to corpus planning in English, nothing has been done. The government modelled Singaporean English after Standard British English, without recognising the internal issues of English which must be specific to the local context. Due to the lack of a government body that deals with language issues such as codification and purification, there is negligence to local English, it becomes difficult to ascertain whether there is a Standard Singapore English. With respect to Chinese language, the government selected Mandarin Chinese as the variety of Chinese language that takes precedence over other social and regional varieties i.e., Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, Hainanese, Hakka. Standardization generally entails increasing the uniformity of the norm, as well as of the norm. The government adopted Mandarin Chinese as one of the four official languages in Singapore and it is mandatory that the Chinese population in Singapore learn Mandarin Chinese as their mother tongue in schools. In addition, the government launched the Speak Mandarin Campaign to promote the prestige of Mandarin Chinese against other Chinese varieties. The Speak Mandarin Campaign was launched by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1979. The campaign seeks to encourage the use of Mandarin and to discourage the use of non-Mandarin Chinese varieties, characterising the latter as 'burdens,' as summarized in Goh Chok Tong's (then First Deputy Prime Minister) speech marking the 1986 Speak Mandarin Campaign: Parents know that our bilingual education system is here to stay, when they drop dialects in conversation with their children they are recognising that the continued use of dialects will add to the learning burden of their children. The success of the campaign was evident 20 years from the launch of the campaign. The campaign has significantly reduced the number of speakers of non-Mandarin Chinese varieties in Singapore. The use of non-Mandarin Chinese varieties at home dropped from 81.4% in 1980 to 30.7% in 2000. Meanwhile, households that claimed to use Mandarin as the dominant language at home increased from 10.2% in 1980 to 35% in 2000. Although the campaign is successful in reducing the number of non-Mandarin Chinese varieties speakers in Singapore, it is not always received positively. This is due to two key reasons: The reason why Mandarin has been chosen among the various Chinese varieties is that it is supposedly able to unite the different Chinese groups, and it is also supposedly the variety associated with ancient Chinese culture and its values. This is not to say that the government considers the other Chinese varieties to be totally without cultural value. The government does at times acknowledge that the other Chinese varieties are also capable of conveying traditional Chinese values. Excerpted from a speech made by then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong during the 1991 Speak Mandarin Campaign: Although Chinese literature, idioms and proverb can be translated into English, their full meaning may be lost in the process. A Chinese Singaporean who does not know Chinese- either Mandarin or dialect- runs the risk of losing the collective wisdom of the Chinese civilization. Non-Mandarin speakers have complained that their children have to study two foreign languages – English and Mandarin. This is contrasted to a possible alternative policy of English and their native language, and that the emphasis on Mandarin threatens family ties, as older generations are often not conversant in Mandarin (unless it is their native tongue). Some critics include that the Mandarin education system's goal of promoting cultural identity has left many younger generations of Mandarin speakers unable to communicate with their non-Mandarin-speaking grandparents. Singapore's Bilingual Policy has been commended on contributing to the country's economic success. The social and political stability that Singapore has enjoyed all these years has also been attributed to the Bilingual policy. There are however, a lot existing issues and potential problems underlying the bilingual policy, while the English language was useful in attaining national cohesion within the Multi-racial Country, Mandarin Chinese, Malay Language, Tamil Language have lost their prestige in the society. To rectify these issues, the government, the policy makers and the teaching professions should co-operate with one another. As front-line practitioners, local teachers have direct experience on the needs and difficulties of students. Parents and peers are invisible planners who have power to determine the success of the government's language policy. The collective collaboration of the government, policy makers, local teachers, parents and peers more effective and indigenised language policy can be designed. Policy discourse in Singapore has largely overlooked the fact that the linguistic market consists of permeable boundaries and the value of linguistic capital for each language changes as internal and external factors interact together. The Ministry of Education was critiqued as failing to recognise that perceptions regarding linguistic capital can change, therefore Language Policy implementation (Bilingual Policy) need to consider the feelings and willingness of the recipients as this ultimately determines the final acceptance and success of the policy. Language Policy and implementations need to consider bottom up processes (Individuals and Unofficial Institutions), and not just designed from the top (Government and Official Agencies). The population's perceptions regarding prestige and image of Ethnic Languages are important parameters that need to be established and analysed in accordance with the Government's Language Policies plans to account for a multicultural country like Singapore. The political advantages that English has to offer cannot be denied. While the bilingual policy aims to educate its population in enhancing communication in the international market, it is also able to protect the cultural identities of the indigenous groups by embracing multiculturalism. However, the processes of globalisation exert increasing pressure on the population to assimilate towards English at the expense of their mother tongues. While diversity breeds potential threats to globalisation, long-term language planning must be sensitive enough to tackle the precarious linguistic situation to protect Mandarin Chinese, Malay and Tamil (the official languages), perhaps even other mother tongue languages alongside English.",Normal

His memoir, Returning: A Spiritual Journey (1988), was called by Bill Moyers ""one of the most important memoirs of the spirit I have ever read"". He edited and wrote the Introduction to Kurt Vonnegut Letters (2012). Wakefield received The Bernard DeVoto Fellowship at The Bread Loaf Writer Conference in 1958, a Nieman Fellowship in Journalism (1963–64) and a Rockefeller Grant in Writing, 1968. Wakefield retired as writer in residence at Florida International University (1995–2009), where he received The Faculty Award for Mentorship. He moved back to his home town of Indianapolis in 2011. Dan Wakefield was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, where his family lived in the Broad Ripple neighborhood. He went to Public School #80 and Shortridge High School, where he began his writing career as a sports columnist for the school newspaper, The Shortridge Daily Echo, and was the school's sports correspondent for The Indianapolis Star. He worked summers during college in The Star sports department and as a general assignment reporter for The Grand Rapids Press. He left Indianapolis in 1952 for New York City, where he graduated from Columbia College, with a B.A. with Honors in English, after having studied with the literary critics Mark Van Doren and Lionel Trilling, as well as the sociologist C. Wright Mills. He worked as a reporter after college on The Princeton Packet, New Jersey's oldest weekly, and left to become a research assistant for the sociologist C. Wright Mills, his professor at Columbia.

"Richard Brilliant (born in Boston, November 20, 1929) is an American art historian, university professor, and writer whose work combines a specialist knowledge of ancient Greek and Roman art with overarching themes in the history and theory of art (e.g. semiotics, portraiture, narrative, and historiography). As noted by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he “transformed the field of classical art, opening it up to new critical methods of historical and stylistic analysis.” His publications, landmarks in the field, have raised the reputation of Roman art, especially that of the later period, which had been disparaged by earlier nineteenth and twentieth pro-Greek critics and scholars. Encouraged by his broad vision and scope of interests, his students have pursued significant careers as academics, researchers, and practitioners in the field of classical art history. Brilliant attended Boston Latin School (1941–1947) and graduated from Yale College in 1951 with a B.A. in classical civilization. Immediately after, he attended Harvard Law School, receiving his LL.B. in 1954. He was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar the same year. Brilliant then returned to Yale to pursue graduate studies with a range of scholars in archaeology and art history, including Harald Ingholt, Vincent Scully, and Kurt Weitzmann. He was awarded an M.A. in 1956 and a Ph.D. in 1960. Brilliant’s dissertation was retitled as Gesture and Rank in Roman Art: The Use of Gestures to Denote Status in Roman Sculpture and Coinage and published in 1963. Brilliant began his teaching career at the University of Pennsylvania in 1964. He became a full professor in 1969, and served as Chairman of the Art History Department. He joined the faculty at Columbia University in 1970 as Professor of Art History and Archaeology and later was named the Anna S. Garbedian Professor in the Humanities. In the Spring term of 1971 Brilliant taught courses at the University of Pittsburgh as Mellon Visiting Professor. He was a Visiting Professor at Princeton University in 1986. He was a Visiting Professor at the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, in 1974, 1980, and 1988, and also served as an Adjunct Professor at the Graduate Institute of Emory University from June 1992 to August 1993. In March 2002, an international colloquium ""The Art of Rome: Shifting Boundaries, Evolving Definitions,"" celebrated his accomplishments and was attended by scores of former students and colleagues. He retired from full-time teaching in 2004, and became Professor Emeritus, but continued teaching, including the Columbia undergraduate course on Contemporary Civilization and he was appointed Senior Scholar by Columbia (2010–2012). From 1990 to 1996, Brilliant served as Editor-in-Chief of The Art Bulletin, the American academic journal of art history published by the College Art Association in the United States. Brilliant was also the Director of the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America at Columbia University during its formative years (1996–2000). Brilliant served on the Governing Board of the Society of Fellows in the Humanities at Columbia University for many years, and as its Chairman (1982–1984). He was a long-term member of the Managing Committee of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (1974–2010) In addition to serving on the National Committee for the History of Art (NCHA) (1997–2000), Brilliant was a consultant for exhibitions at the Jewish Museum in New York City and the Museum of the New York Historical Society. He also served as consultant to various media productions, and appeared on screen in the Alexandria Production program Rome: Power and Glory for the Discovery Channel, December 1997. Brilliant was awarded a Fulbright scholarship for study in Italy (1957–1959) which allowed him to complete his dissertation. He subsequently received a Rome Prize from the American Academy in Rome (1960–1962), resulting in a definitive published study of the Arch of Septimius Severus. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1967 and returned to Italy to immerse himself in other aspects of Roman and Greek art. In 1972–1973 he was a Senior Fellow of the National Endowment for the Humanities in Rome. Brilliant received Great Teacher awards from the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University and the Alexander Hamilton Medal from Columbia (1994). He was named as Distinguished Scholar for 2005 by the College Art Association. In 2005 he was also elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1952, just after graduating from Yale College, Brilliant married Eleanor Luria (Smith 1952), who, after earning advanced degrees in social work and social policy, became a Professor at Rutgers University (New Brunswick), and a distinguished scholar in the field of nonprofit studies.

"Matthew Whitworth-Aylmer, 5th Baron Aylmer, GCB (24 May 1775 – 23 February 1850) was a British military officer and colonial administrator. Aylmer was gazetted ensign in 1787, lieutenant in 1791 and major in 1800, after being held in a French prison for six months in 1798. His career continued as colonel in 1810, being aide-de-camp to King George III between 1810 and 1812 and then major general in 1813. He was present at most of the battles in the Peninsular War. In 1814, following service in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, he was appointed adjutant general of British forces in Ireland, where he remained until 1823. After reaching the position of lieutenant-general in 1825, Aylmer was, in 1830, appointed commander of British military forces in North America as well as Governor General of British North America and Lieutenant Governor of Lower Canada. Lord Aylmer had no previous experience as a civil administrator and no political experience. He was unable to pacify the growing demands in Lower Canada for responsible government and, in 1834, the radical Assembly of Lower Canada passed 92 resolutions of grievance including a demand that Aylmer be recalled. Lord Aylmer exacerbated ethnic tensions in Lower Canada by favouring the English over the French. The deterioration of the situation led to his recall in 1835. His administration may have been a contributing factor to the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837. Returning to England, Aylmer was promoted to the rank of general in 1845, but he never obtained a British peerage (his dignity was in the Irish peerage) or another administrative post. He died at 15 Eaton Square, Belgravia, on 23 February 1850 and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. Aylmer's sister Rose Aylmer was the inspiration behind the poem of that name by Walter Savage Landor. His sister was Rose Whitworth-Aylmer who travelled with their aunt, Anne Barbara, and her husband Henry Russel to India in 1798. She fell ill with cholera and died in 1800. She has been immortalized by his friend and the famous British poet Walter Savage Landor in his Rose Aylmer eulogy. General the Right Honourable Matthew Whitworth, 5th Lord Aylmer, G.C.B., married Louisa Anne Call, daughter of Sir John Call, Bart. on 4 August 1801. When her husband was appointed in 1830 to administer the government of Canada, as Governor-General, from February 1831 to August 1835, the couple entertained at the Castle of St. Louis, Quebec. During the cholera epidemic of 1831–32, she was interested in the relief of the sufferers. Since she was interested in education, she regularly visited and bestowed prizes in the schools. She served as the patroness of the Societe d'Education sous la direction des dames lie Quebec. She died on 13 August 1862. Works cited",Normal

"As coach Robert Clifton Henley (born January 30, 1973) is an American professional baseball coach, former Major League catcher and former minor league manager. A longtime member of the Washington Nationals' organization, he was promoted to Major League third-base coach on the staff of new Nationals' manager Matt Williams on November 19, 2013. During his active career (1993–1999; 2002), Henley threw and batted right-handed; he stood 6feet 2inches (1.88m) tall and weighed 190 pounds (86kg). He graduated from Mobile County High School in Grand Bay, Alabama, and was selected in the 26th round by the Montreal Expos (predecessors to the Nationals) in the 1991 Major League Baseball draft. Fighting persistent injuries, Henley broke into pro baseball in 1993, then progressed through the Montreal farm system, batting over .300 twice. In 1998, he saw his only Major League service. He spent the early part of the season on the disabled list, and then appeared in 50 minor league games with the Triple-A Ottawa Lynx and the Class A Jupiter Hammerheads before making his MLB debut as a defensive replacement in the eighth inning of a 6–1 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 19 at Olympic Stadium. He walked in his first MLB plate appearance, and, the following day, when he started against the Philadelphia Phillies, he singled off Curt Schilling in his first official at bat. Henley would appear in 41 games, starting 30 at catcher, for the 1998 Expos, as he and Mike Hubbard backed up regular Chris Widger. He amassed 35 hits and 11 walks in 132 plate appearances, batting .304 and collecting three homers (off Pedro Astacio, Kirt Ojala and Bobby Jones) and eight doubles. On September 25, his penultimate appearance of the season, Henley went 4-for-4 with two doubles and three runs batted in against the St. Louis Cardinals. But 1998 would be his only Major League season, and his last full season as an active player. Beset by elbow miseries, he played in only two minor league games in 1999 and missed the 2000 and 2001 campaigns completely. Released by the Expos, he got into one minor league game with the Class A Hickory Crawdads, a Pittsburgh Pirates affiliate, in 2002 before retiring from the field. Henley rejoined the Montreal system in 2003 as manager of the Rookie-Level Gulf Coast League Expos, and remained in the organization after the Expos relocated to Washington, D.C., in 2005, managing at the Rookie and Class A levels through 2009, and serving as the Nationals' field coordinator of minor league instruction from 2010 to 2013, leading to his promotion to Williams' staff. He was fired with Williams and the rest of the coaching staff after the 2015 season, but was rehired to serve under new manager Dusty Baker. His contract expired after the 2017 season, but Henley was again rehired as third base coach, becoming the only holdover from Baker's coaching staff to join the new staff headed by manager Dave Martinez. On October 10, 2021, Henley was removed from his major league role but remained in the organization in a player development role.",Normal

"Joseph Frank Fontana PC (born January 13, 1950) is an Italian-born Canadian politician. He was a Liberal member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1987 to 2006, and mayor of London, Ontario from 2010 until his 2014 convictions for fraud and forgery. Fontana was born in Cellara, Cosenza, Italy in 1950, and moved to Canada with his parents at the age of four. He studied chemical engineering at the University of Waterloo, but left school after becoming the drummer in a rock band. He later moved to London and briefly returned to school at the University of Western Ontario, but left to work in real estate and the insurance industry. He opposed the building of a federal prison in London and soon became involved in local politics. In 1976 he ran for city council, representing Ward 3, but lost; in 1978 he also lost the Liberal nomination for the federal riding of London-Middlesex, but was elected to London City Council later in the year and served there until 1988, sitting on London's Board of Control from 1985 to 1988. In 1988 he was elected to the House of Commons as a member of the opposition and served as Critic for Urban Affairs and Housing. He also formed the band ""True Grit"" with several Liberals including Roger Gallaway and future prime minister Jean Chrétien (who played trombone). He became the Ontario chair of the Liberal caucus and was involved in the Task Force on Via Rail and the Task Force on the Economy and Recession. In 1990 he supported Paul Martin's attempt to become leader of the Liberal Party. He was re-elected in 1993 and became parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Transport, playing a key role in, among other things, the introduction of the National Airports Policy. From 1996 to 1999 he served a record three times as chair of the national Liberal caucus and in 1999 became chair of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration and the chair of the Southwestern Ontario Liberal caucus. He served as Minister of Labour in Paul Martin's minority government until February 6, 2006, when Stephen Harper was sworn in as Prime Minister. He was re-elected in 1997, 2000, 2004, and 2006. Appointed as the critic for Science and Research within the Liberal shadow cabinet, Mr. Fontana was strongly speculated to be considering a run for leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, though he ultimately did not seek the post, supporting Gerard Kennedy instead. On September 8, 2006, Fontana announced that he would run for mayor in London against mayor Anne Marie DeCicco-Best. On September 20, 2006, Fontana formally resigned his seat in the House of Commons in order to run for mayor. He was unsuccessful, losing badly to Mayor DeCicco-Best. He subsequently announced he would run in the 2010 London mayoral election, again against DeCicco-Best. Fontana won the mayoralty in that election. As a member of the Privy Council of Canada, Fontana automatically received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012. In October 2012, calls for Fontana's resignation as mayor were made amid allegations of misuse of government funds used to pay for his son's wedding. Some city councillors urged Fontana to step aside during the investigation. On November 21, 2012, the London detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police issued a press release announcing that Fontana had been charged with breach of trust by a public officer; fraud under $5,000; and uttering forged documents. On November 22, 2012, Fontana offered to resign from the London Police Services Board and his resignation was formally accepted. Under municipal law governing Ontario, Police Services cannot allow an individual who is under investigation for a criminal offences to take part in any police function. At the next meeting of council's Finance and Administrative Services Committee, its councillors asked that Fontanta step aside, voting by a 3–1 vote margin that he resign his council seat and duties as mayor, however the committee decision was not binding under the Municipal Act. A council motion asking Fontana to leave office pending resolution of his criminal charges lost by a vote, 8–5. Fontana was found guilty of the charges by the Ontario Superior Court on June 13, 2014, and sentenced to serve 4 months under house arrest and 18 months on probation. On June 16, 2014, Fontana announced he would be stepping down as mayor of London. He formally resigned on June 19, and was temporarily succeeded by Ward 3 city councillor Joe Swan as acting mayor until a council vote the following week selected Joni Baechler as his formal successor until the 2014 municipal election.

"Oregon Route 210 Oregon Route 210 (also known as Scholls Ferry Road, or, more formally, the Scholls Highway No. 143 (see Oregon highways and routes)) is a state highway which runs between the community of Scholls, Oregon and the Raleigh Hills neighborhood west of Portland, terminating at the Sylvan overpass on Highway 26. It has become an important route for both commuters and agriculture through Washington County. Oregon Route 210 is signed from east-to-west; though in actuality it runs in a northeast-to-southwest direction. The neighborhoods located along Route 210 are generally affluent, being higher in rent than 83.1% of the neighborhoods in Oregon. Oregon Route 210's western terminus is at the junction with Oregon Route 219 in the town of Scholls. The highway leaves Scholls headed due north-northeast (on a 2-lane, unlimited-access alignment), crossing the Tualatin River over a bridge which replaced the historic Scholls Ferry (for which the road is still named). Soon after, there is a roundabout with River Road; with Oregon Route 210 heading east, and River Road heading towards Hillsboro to the west. Continuing east, the road winds through farmland (as well as a few wineries) in the fertile Tualatin Valley for several miles until the town of Kinton, and then toward its intersection with Roy Rogers Road. Near the intersection with Roy Rogers Road (named for a Washington County official, not for the famous cowboy) which heads south towards Sherwood, Oregon Route 210 enters Portland's Urban Growth Boundary, and the farms and wineries are suddenly replaced with townhouses and subdivisions, and OR 210 transforms instantly into a suburban thoroughfare. A short distance further east, the highway passes on the edge of the Murrayhill neighborhood of Beaverton and becomes a four-lane divided expressway (one which is frequently clogged with rush-hour traffic). At this point, Oregon Route 210 becomes the boundary between Beaverton and the city of Tigard, with Beaverton to the north and Tigard to the south. The highway continues east for several more miles in this fashion until its intersection with Oregon Route 217, a freeway serving Portland's southwestern suburbs. This intersection is frequently congested, as most traffic leaves OR 210 to get on OR 217 (generally heading north towards downtown Beaverton and Portland). Also nearby is the community of Progress and the Washington Square shopping mall, as well as Hall Boulevard, a major thoroughfare through Beaverton and Tigard. North of Hall Boulevard, the road once again becomes a two-lane route as it ambles through several neighborhoods in unincorporated Washington County. It heads in a north-northeasterly direction until it reaches the Raleigh Hills neighborhood, where Oregon Route 210 ends at an intersection with Oregon Route 10, the Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway. Scholls Ferry Road continues in a northeasterly direction for several more miles until it intersects with Oregon Route 8 and U.S. Route 26 in the Sylvan neighborhood. This stretch used to be signed as Oregon Route 210 as well; but that designation was removed some years ago. There are two other notable alignment changes over the years. In the segment between Raleigh Hills and Progress one can find a residential street called ""Old Scholls Ferry Road""; this was an older alignment of the highway. South of the Murrayhill neighborhood is a street called Barrows Road; this also was an old alignment of OR 210 before the new alignment through Murrayhill was constructed in the late 80s or early 90s. (For a while after the new roadway was built, Barrows Road continued to be signed as 210; however it no longer carries this designation). The current alignment, which goes over a hill, was actually the original alignment of the highway; sometime before 1960 the highway was rerouted to a longer but more level route along what is now called Barrows Road. At that time the ""new"" level route became Scholls Ferry Road, signed as OR 210, and the original route was renamed Old Scholls Ferry Road. In the 1990s Old Scholls Ferry Road regained its designation as OR 210 and the Barrows Road name was applied to the former route. The entire route is in Washington County.",Normal

"Blake Leeper (born August 31, 1989) is a United States Paralympic athlete, eight-time Paralympic Track and Field international medalist, world record holder and three-time American record holder. Leeper started his medal run in 2011 at the Parapan American Games where he took silver in the 100-meter dash. He went on to compete in the 2012 Paralympic Games in London, where he picked up two more medals, a bronze in the 200-meter dash and silver in the 400-meter dash, losing to South African Oscar Pistorius, whose world record of 45.39 seconds is the one Leeper was chasing. In 2013, Leeper also took four medals at the Paralympic World Championships in Lyon, France, where he ran as part of the world record-setting 4x100-meter relay gold medal team. At the same event he took the silver medal in the 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash and 400-meter dash. Leeper's medal collection includes one gold, six silver and one bronze. Over his career, he hopes to win more medals than any Paralympic athlete in track and field. In addition to the medals he has already won, Leeper holds one 2013 Paralympic world record in the 4 × 100 m relay and three American records in the 100-meter dash (10.91), the 200-meter dash (21.7) and the 400-meter dash (44.42-Prague 2018). Leeper's world record for his part in the 4x100-meter relay still stands today. He served a one-year ban through June 2016 because he tested positive for cocaine. Leeper received official notification from the United States Olympic Committee's Paralympic Track and Field High Performance Director confirming his spot in the U.S. Paralympic Team Trials that commenced June 30 in Charlotte, North Carolina. The notification also recognized a one-year suspension agreement that Leeper and the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) had previously entered into. With the official notification, Leeper stepped closer to his quest to break the 400-meter Paralympic world record set by Oscar Pistorius. He has also set an example for many children and adults. Blake Leeper completed a one-year suspension and set a new American record in the double-amputee (T43) 200-metre race with a time of 21.49 seconds at McMaster University Summer Twilight track series in Ontario Canada, June 21, 2016. He also set an American record in the 400-metre race with a time of 46.54 seconds. Blake Leeper was chosen by the US Paralympics to represent Team USA in Rio 2016. At the Paralympic trials, he set a new American record in the 200m with a time of 21.5 and a new America's record in the 400m at 46.1. He took silver in the 100m despite losing a prosthetic leg crossing the finish line live on NBC. Blake Leeper was born in Kingsport, Tennessee with both legs missing below the knee, and has worn prosthetics since nine months of age. In his childhood, Blake participated in various sports, baseball, basketball etc. with his dad coaching. Blake credits his outstanding positive attitude to his family. He studies medicine at the University of Tennessee. Leeper made his international debut in 2009 at Rio de Janeiro. In 2011 he won a silver medal in the World Championships 4 × 100 m relay T42–46 classification with a time of 42.84. In the 2012 Paralympic Games, he won an individual silver medal in the 400 meter T44 event and a bronze medal in the 200m T44 event with a time of 22.46. On Feb. 1, 2016, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency announced that Leeper tested positive for benzoylecgonine from a sample collected on June 21, 2015, at the U.S. Paralympic Track & Field National Championships held in St. Paul, Minn. Benzoylecgonine is a metabolite of cocaine, a substance in the class of Stimulants prohibited under the USADA Protocol for Olympic and Paralympic Movement Testing and the International Paralympic Committee Anti-Doping Code, both of which have adopted the World Anti-Doping Code (""Code"") and the World Anti-Doping Agency Prohibited List. It was determined that Leeper's use of cocaine was not intended to enhance performance, and in consideration of other mitigating factors, he was deemed eligible for a reduced, one-year sanction. Blake Leeper returned to the world of track and field at the U.S. Track & Field Championships in 2017, becoming the first double-leg amputee to compete at the event. After qualifying for semifinals with a time of 45.52 seconds in the 400m, Leeper was able to break Oscar Pistorius' world record in the event with a time of 45.25 seconds the next day. This time bested the previous record of 45.39 seconds. On 2019, Leeper made an appearance as a contestant on the fourth episode of the first season of Netflix's Awake. He made it until the last round, winning a prize of $191,011.25, leaving the competition right before the million dollar Buyout, his count being off by $373.50. Leeper also appeared on the Jan. 4, 2021, edition of Let's Make a Deal, in which he competed in the game ""0 to 80"" for a chance to win a new car. Leeper was unsuccessful in his quest to win the car, instead leaving with $50 from host Wayne Brady. World Athletics formed The Mechanical Aids Review Panel in January 2021 to research the passive-elastic carbon-fibre running specific prostheses Leeper wears in competition. The report found the devices gave Leeper a leg length of 104cm and a standing height of 184cm, almost 10cm above the Maximum Allowable Standing Height established for paralympic athletes. The report found that ""there is a direct relationship between leg length and running speed."" ""The only conclusion that is open is that Mr Leeper is running unnaturally tall in using his new RSPs."" On April 26, 2021, it was ruled Leeper cannot compete in major World Athletics meets or the Paralympics in the RSPs. He can wear them in other International Competitions although his results will be listed separately and not recognized.",Normal

"Foreign Letters (Hebrew: מרחקים) is a 2012 IsraeliAmerican drama film based on a true story of the movie's writer and director, Ela Thier. The movie, which has received mixed reviews from multiple sources, involves Ellie, a 12-year-old immigrant girl from Israel, and her family after moving into the United States in 1982. At first she experiences all kinds of difficulties, but then she meets Thuy, a Vietnamese refugee her age, bringing a changing point as the movie progresses. Its themes include the immigrant experience, learning English, dealing with prejudice, sharing secrets, opening to other cultures, and creatively handling conflict in friendships. Based on the filmmaker's own experience, Foreign Letters is a story about prejudice, ""poverty, shame, and the power of friendship to heal us"". The film features the music of iconic Israeli musician Chava Alberstein, who was the director's favorite musician when her family immigrated to the US in 1982. The film was the official selection at the Toronto Jewish Film Festival. Ellie (Noa Rotstein) has come to the United States from Israel with her father, mother, and little brother in 1982. After her uncle was killed by friendly fire during the 1982 Lebanon War, her parents decided to leave the country in protest. Feeling homesick, Ellie keeps in touch with her best friend in Israel telling her about their new television and shopping in thrift stores. But as time goes on, she gets more and more frustrated about not knowing English. At school where she is in sixth grade, Ellie takes a special class in order to learn how to speak and write. To push herself even more, she purchases a typewriter so she can practice this new language. At school, a popular girl ridicules her for wearing a pendant with Hebrew letters on it and speaks down to her. So Ellie turns to the only other outsider in her class: Thuy (Dalena Le), a Vietnamese girl who lives in a small apartment with her parents and brothers and sisters - having fled from their homeland after the Vietnam War. Thuy is shy and reserved; she keeps to herself at school and claims to have a strict father who wants her to study all the time so she can go to college. Ellie is forced to take the lead in their slowly unfolding friendship as they eat lunch together, visit each other's homes, go skating, walk in the forest, and even share the fun of making prank phone calls. Ellie develops crushes on two boys but it takes a major effort and ritual to get Thuy to say what boy she likes best. To solidify their friendship, Ellie writes a contract. They promise to spend time together every recess and to always call the other back, and since they are best friends forever they agree that when they grow up they will always live next door to each other, or in the same house, if the husbands agree. With such high expectations, Ellie and Thuy's friendship hits a rough patch. Ellie must decide whether to reconnect or not.",Normal

"Christopher Cleland Schacht (born 6 December 1946) is a former Australian politician and member of the South Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). He was born in Melbourne and educated at the University of Adelaide and Wattle Park Teachers College. Schacht's political career started as a state party official in 1969 during the Don Dunstan era. In 1987, he entered Federal Parliament as a Labor Party Senator for South Australia. He was Minister for Science and Small Business and Minister assisting the Prime Minister for Science in the Keating Labor Government from March 1993 to March 1994 and then Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction until Labor's defeat at the 1996 election. He left the parliament in June 2002 after 15 years as a Senator and 33 years in Australian politics. In 2006, Senator Robert Ray said of Schacht's ""long-winded critiques"" of factionalism within the Labor party that ""no-one practised factionalism harder than he did. But once he lost influence in his own faction, he condemned all factions."" Schacht has openly criticised the influence that he believes trade unions have within the Labor party. Schacht has supported uranium mining and the prospect of nuclear waste storage in South Australia. He told ABC's Stateline in 2006 that storing the world's nuclear waste ""may be the safest thing we can do for the world. Secondly, the world will pay a large amount of money in the future for some place like Australia or outback South Australia to store nuclear waste safely in a safe, in a geologically sound area, with a stable political system."" In 2008 Schacht was appointed as a Director of Marathon Resources. The company's exploration for uranium in Arkaroola later became a subject of controversy. A series of environmental breaches resulted in the revocation of the company's exploration license and the establishment of the Arkaroola Protection Zone. As of 2015, Schacht is a registered political lobbyist in South Australia. His clients include Pilatus Australia, Liebherr Australia, PMB Defence and Basetec Services. Former clients include VIPAC Engineers and Scientists. Schacht is also the chairman of the Australia China Development Company and an ambassador for the National Secular Lobby.

"Charles Bradford Isham (July 20, 1853 – June 9, 1919) was an American historian. Isham was born in New York City on July 20, 1853. He was the son of William Bradley Isham (1827–1909) and Julia (née Burhans) Isham (1827–1907). His father was a leather merchant who owned downtown factories and warehouses on Gold and Cliff Streets and became vice president of the Bank of the Metropolis and the president of the Bond and Mortgage Guarantee Company. Among his siblings were: sister Julia Isham (wife of Henry Osborn Taylor); and brothers, Samuel Isham, an artist; and William Burhans Isham. In 1862, his father rented the former house and estate of the late Dr. Floyd T. Ferris in uptown Manhattan as a summer residence. The two-story house, located on forty-acres in the neighborhood now known as Inwood, had been built in the 1850s and was part of the Dyckman tract. Isham purchased the house and estate two years later in 1864. The Isham children later donated, and sold, parcels of the estate to the City of New York for the creation of Isham Park. His maternal grandfather was Col. Benjamin Burnhans of Warrensburg, New York and his paternal grandparents were Charles Isham and Flora (née Bradley) Isham, a daughter of Judge William Bradley of Hartford, Connecticut. Isham was educated at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts before attending Harvard University, where he graduated in 1876. He also studied at the University of Berlin and the Collège de France. After receiving a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1878, he was admitted to the bar in New York in 1881. In April 1889, Isham was hired as private secretary at the United States Legation in London, while Robert Todd Lincoln was the U.S. Minister to the United Kingdom from 1889 to 1893 (under Benjamin Harrison and Grover Cleveland). Reportedly, Isham obtained the position through his distant cousin, Edward Swift Isham, Lincoln's former law partner. Lincoln, the son of the 16th President Abraham Lincoln, had previously been the United States Secretary of War (under James Garfield and Chester A. Arthur). Isham, who was fluent in German and French, was, foremost, a historian with a reputation ""as a learned scholar and brilliant intellectual."" He served as Resident Graduate in History at Harvard and the Librarian of the New-York Historical Society, of which his father had been a member. In 1895, he gave a speech at the Society about the importance of the Louisburg Expedition of 1745. On September 2, 1891, Isham was married to Mary Todd ""Mamie"" Lincoln (1869–1938) at the Brompton Parish Church in London, England. Mamie was the eldest daughter of Mary Eunice (née Harlan) Lincoln, and Robert Todd Lincoln, and the granddaughter of President Lincoln and, her namesake, Mary Todd Lincoln. Isham and his wife bought a place in Manchester, Vermont, later known as the 1811 house, until they moved to New York City, residing at 19 East 72nd Street. Together, Charles and Mamie were the parents of one child: After a short illness, Isham died at his residence, 122 East 38th Street in New York City, on June 9, 1919.

"The Rom is a Grade II listed skatepark in Hornchurch, East London, England. Built in 1978, and designed by Adrian Rolt of G-Force, it is the most completely preserved purpose-built skatepark in England. It is the first skatepark in Europe to achieve listed status and the second such structure worldwide. It was built and opened in August 1978 and is named after the adjacent River Rom. It was designed by Adrian Rolt of G-Force. Rolt is considered the leading skatepark designer of the 1970s. In 1979 John Greenwood took control of the Rom Skatepark and with the help of his business acumen, he has managed to keep the Rom open for skateboarders and BMXers until 2018. In 2014 it was given Grade II listed status becoming only the second skateboard park in the world to achieve preservation status after the Bro Bowl in Tampa, Florida. The Bro Bowl has subsequently been demolished, 3D scanned and rebuilt in a different location of the same park area meaning that Rom is the only heritage listed full size skatepark in existence. A film about the history of the park - Rom Boys: 40 Years of Rad is currently on general release on major streaming platforms .  The skatepark occupies an area of 8,000 square metres (86,000sqft).

"Robie Lewis Reid (1866 – 1945) was a historian and jurist in British Columbia, Canada. Reid wrote many books and essays on the history of British Columbia, but his special interest was the study of the works of Rudyard Kipling. Another special field of interest was that coins of early British Columbia, concerning which he remains one of the main authorities. Reid was born in Cornwallis Township, Kings County, Nova Scotia, in the community of Steam Mill Village on November 3, 1866, but ventured to British Columbia in 1885 to Victoria, British Columbia, in 1885 to write the provincial teacher's examination. During this experience he met Frederic W. Howay, with whom he established a personal and professional relationship that lasted sixty years. Reid persuaded Howay to return to Nova Scotia with him to register for Law at Dalhousie University, from which they graduated together in 1890 and in 1893 formed the lawfirm Howay & Reid. Reid was appointed debenture commissioner for New Westminster after that city's Great Fire in 1898. In 1907 Reid joined William J. Bowser, then Attorney-General of British Columbia and later Premier, and D.S. Wallbridge to form Bowser, Reid & Wallbridge. From 1927 to 1943 Reid was a Bencher of the Law Society of British Columbia. Reid was also a member of the UBC board of governors from 1913 to 1935, and President of the British Columbia Historical Association in 1937, and is credited with the founding of the British Columbia Historical Quarterly. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1936, and was also a Member of the American Historical Association, Washington. Dr. Reid's interests in literature and the arts are also well documented. He was the first President of the Vancouver Little Theatre Association, and a member and chairman of the Board of the Vancouver Public Library. He died on February 6, 1945, of failing health.

"Joe Dan Washington Jr (born September 24, 1953) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Diego Chargers, Baltimore Colts, Washington Redskins, and Atlanta Falcons. Washington graduated from Lincoln High School in Port Arthur, Texas, where his father coached football. Washington had a stellar college football career at the University of Oklahoma, where he was a two-time First-team All-American and finished third in the Heisman Trophy balloting in 1974 and fifth in 1975. He finished his career at Oklahoma with 4,071 career rushing yards. He is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. Washington was drafted fourth overall in the first round of the 1976 NFL Draft by the San Diego Chargers. A knee injury forced him to miss the entire 1976 season for the Chargers. In 1977 he played sparingly, appearing in 13 games while rushing for 217 yards and having 244 yards receiving. He was traded along with a 1979 fifth-round selection (131st overall–traded to Detroit Lions for Greg Landry) from the Chargers to the Colts for Lydell Mitchell on August 23, 1978. The transaction was the result of Mitchell's acrimonious contract dispute with Colts management in which he accused team owner Robert Irsay of bad faith bargaining and racial discrimination. In 1978, his first year with the Colts, he had 958 yards rushing, which was a career high. In 1979 he led the NFL with 82 receptions. He also had 750 yards receiving and 884 yards rushing along with seven touchdowns. This led Washington to being voted to the 1979 Pro Bowl. His most memorable performance was on September 18, 1978, in Baltimore's 34–27 victory over the New England Patriots on Monday Night Football, when he had a hand in three of the four touchdowns scored by the Colts in a fourth quarter in which both teams combined for 41 points. He helped lead off the scoring by throwing a 54-yard option pass to Roger Carr. Washington followed that up with a 23-yard touchdown catch from Bill Troup. Washington broke a 27–27 deadlock by scoring the game-winner on a 90-yard kickoff return in a driving rainstorm. It was scored in the final seconds of the game after the Patriots came back from 27 to 13. He remains the only NFL player to ever throw a touchdown, catch a touchdown and return a kickoff for a touchdown in a single game. On April 28, 1981, the Washington Redskins obtained Washington by trading a second-round pick in the 1981 NFL Draft to the Baltimore Colts. During his first year with the Redskins in 1981, Washington combined with future Hall of Famer John Riggins to give the Redskins a formidable running game. Washington led the team in rushing with 916 yards and receptions with 70 to go along with 558 yards receiving. The strike shortened 1982 season was mostly a disappointing season for Washington as he only recorded 190 yards rushing during the 9 game regular season and only touched the ball seven times during the Redskins run through the playoffs where they defeated the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl XVII. Washington returned to his normal dual threat capabilities in 1983 as he recorded 772 yards rushing and 454 yards receiving as the Redskins returned to the Super Bowl only to lose Super Bowl XVIII to the Los Angeles Raiders. During the 1984 season, Washington only played in 7 games for the Redskins and recorded 192 yards rushing. He was traded to the Atlanta Falcons during the 1985 NFL Draft and finished his career with one season in Atlanta. During the 1985 season with the Falcons, Washington appeared in all 16 games while recording 210 yards rushing and 37 receptions for 328 yards. Washington retired with 4,839 rushing yards and 3,413 receiving yards and 30 touchdowns in his career. He had worked as a financial adviser for Wells Fargo. With former basketball player Julius Erving, Washington fielded a NASCAR Busch Series team from 1998 to 2000. In May 2007, Washington returned to the University of Oklahoma, to serve as the special assistant to the director of athleticsexecutive director of the Varsity O Association.",Normal

"A trigger film is a type of short social guidance educational film intended for student audiences. It is often presented in elementary and middle school classrooms and carry themes that are often about topics such as morality, ethics, and safety. The movies often carry a loose, disconnected, plot that intentionally lacks a conclusion or even a moral. Trigger films are usually very short and only have a few scenes. They are usually not accompanied by narration or any prologue (except, perhaps, to introduce the situation), instead the audience only observes the characters' behaviors and actions. The intention of a trigger film is to ""trigger"" a discussion about the short scenes presented in the movie and how the characters reacted to the situation, and how each viewer would handle that situation differently. The teacher often serves as a mediator, perhaps offering his or her own insights, but most of the discussion is left to the students. A trigger film about cheating on a school test would be presented as follows: The film would start in a classroom with the protagonist, a struggling student who would like to pass an exam. The student, worried that he will not pass the test without help, resorts to looking at a neighboring students' exam and completes it. The film ends. Note that unlike ""non-trigger"" educational films about similar topics, there is no narration of what the student is doing, nor does it conclude that the student was caught and subsequently disciplined nor does it disclose if the student got a good or bad grade on the test. The film instead tries to trigger the audience to come to its own conclusions of whether it was right or wrong to copy off someone's test and whether, if the viewer was in the place of the protagonist, they would have done the same thing. Studies have been conducted to determine how effective trigger films are to change students' perceptions of morality and ethics. Proponents believe trigger films succeed in invoking thoughts and conclusions that come straight from the viewer instead of having a narrator dispense the moral to students, and that lessons learned firsthand are much more valuable than lessons learned from a character in a short film. Supporters also believe that other social guidance films tended to emphasize not the morality, but the disciplinary consequences for the immoral behavior. As such, the viewers learn only not to get caught committing the behavior. Trigger films are not only used in grade school, but also in colleges and universities; especially those curricula that greatly involve ethics, such as medical fields, law enforcement, business, and public relations.",Normal

"Henry Dawkins II (24 May 1728 – 19 June 1814) was a Jamaican plantation and slave owner and Member of the Parliament of Great Britain (MP). The Dawkins family settled on Jamaica shortly after its seizure from the Spanish in 1655. William Dawkins (d. 1694) acquired plantations in Jamaica, by grant, in the period 1669 to 1682. These descended to his grandsons James Dawkins I, and the sons of Henry Dawkins I (1698–1744), James Dawkins II and Henry Dawkins II, sons of Henry Dawkins I, all three being MPs. Both James I and James II left property in England to Henry II, who also inherited Jamaican properties from relatives, for an annual income of £40,000 to £50,000. It has been estimated that the gross income of the Jamaican plantations was more than £44,000 in 1775. At his death in 1744, Henry Dawkins I owned in Jamaica Old Plantation, Parnassus, Friendship, Green River, Leicester Fields, Trout Hall, One Eye, Sandy Gully Pen, Windsor, Folly Pen, Bog Hole Pen, Withywood Pastures and Treadways, including 1,315 slaves in total. He was born 24 May 1728 in Clarendon, Jamaica. He was the third surviving son of Henry Dawkins I (1698–1744), a slave-owner, sugar planter, and his wife, Elizabeth (1698–1737), daughter of Edward Pennant of Clarendon, chief justice of Jamaica and of Elizabet Moore. His brothers were plantation and slave-owner James Dawkins II, his eldest brother and the elder brother, major slave owner William Dawkins (1726–1753). He studied at John Roysse's Free School in Abingdon, (now Abingdon School) c. 1739-1744 and St Mary Hall, Oxford from 1745. Dawkins's father on his death in 1744 bequeathed 25,000 acres of land and approximately £100,000 to his three surviving sons. James, the eldest son (James Dawkins II, who died in 1757), inherited 14,300 acres, William (died in 1753, without issue) received 5,000, and Henry 5,700. By c. 1750 he owned 20,000 acres in Jamaica (St Elizabeth, Clarendon and Vere) and of estates in Wiltshire and Oxfordshire. By 1809 he owned the total of 1,464 slaves on the estates of Parnassus, Folly, Old Plantation, Friendship and Suttons. From 1752 to 1758 Henry Dawkins was a member of the assembly in Jamaica, and was then on the council to 1759. In 1760 he entered the Parliament of Great Britain as member for Southampton, holding the seat to 1768. He then was member for Chippenham, Hindon and Chippenham again, leaving Parliament finally in 1784. He served for a 24-year period with only short breaks (one caused by his defeat at Salisbury, near his estate at Standlynch, in 1768). He was a Steward of the Old Abingdonian Club in 1769. According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, there is no record of Dawkins having spoken in the House of Commons. However, from 1773 to 1805 he was a member of the Society of West India Planters and Merchants, a pressure group. His son James succeeded him at Chippenham. He died 19 June 1814 in London and was buried at Chipping Norton. His wealth at death was £150,000. Dawkins sold his brother's estate at Laverstoke in 1759. In 1766 he inherited Over Norton Park in Oxfordshire from his uncle James Dawkins. He kept this property (which remains in the Dawkins family to this day). The family also rented a London property in Upper Brook Street. Also in 1764 he bought Standlynch Park in Wiltshire. This house, now called Trafalgar Park, was bought from William Young for £22,000. When Dawkins died in 1814, Standlynch Park was sold for £90,000 to William Nelson, 1st Earl Nelson, who had been voted the money needed to purchase an estate by Parliament. He changed the name to Trafalgar House and Park. Dawkins was a patron of neoclassical architects. He had alterations done to Standlynch House (a building by the architect John James dating from the 1730s). Dawkins had work done on the wings, by John Wood, the Younger, and on the portico by Nicholas Revett. Revett was an associate of Dawkins' brother James, who had antiquarian interests. Revett and both Dawkins brothers were members of the Society of Dilettanti. As can be seen from the original floor plans signed by J. Wood Arch, Dawkins seems to have built the north wing for himself and his wife Lady Juliana, while the south wing mainly housed the dining room, kitchen and brewery. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1778. Dawkins married in 1759, Lady Juliana Colyear (1735–1821), daughter of Charles Colyear, 2nd Earl of Portmore and Juliana Hele. They had eight sons and four daughters. The sons were: The daughters were: Henry was the great-great-great-grandfather of the biologist Professor Richard Dawkins. In 2010 Richard Dawkins wrote an obituary for his father, describing how John Dawkins had inherited Over Norton Park from a distant cousin and how the estate, in the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, had been in the family since the 1720s.",Normal
"Wilhelm (Willi) Friedrich Adolf Ritterbusch (3 July 1892, in Werdau, Germany – 10 April 1981, in Skelund, Denmark), was a Nazi Party political functionary. Among other positions, he was the German Generalkommissar zur Besonderen Verwendung (""Commissioner-General for Special Duties""), directing the political affairs and propaganda in the occupied Netherlands from the middle of July 1943 until 7 May 1945, the end of World War II. Wilhelm Ritterbusch was a son of Hermann Ritterbusch a bricklayer from Zschakau (now Beilrode) a municipality in the district of Nordsachsen, in Saxony, Germany. His brother, Paul Ritterbusch was one of the most prominent NS science functionaries. Another brother, Fritz Ritterbusch, was a Hauptsturmführer of the Waffen-SS and Allgemeine-SS, a member of the guard staff of several Nazi concentration camps, and the commander of the Trautenau-Parschnitz camp. Ritterbusch participated as a company commander in World War I. In 1923, he joined the NSDAP (Member No. 6,316). During the Kampfzeit (""the time of struggle"") before 1933, he allegedly worked as a Gauleiter (""Party Leader"") for a while. In 1937, he became the Kreisleiter (""County Leader"") of the NSDAP in Torgau, Gau Halle-Merseburg. In the fall of 1939, Ritterbusch was considered by the staff of the Parteikanzlei (""Deputy Führer"") for the position of Stellvertreter-Gauleiter (""Deputy Gau Leader""). In September 1939, Helmuth Friedrichs, a department head on the staff of Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess, classified him ""to be used on all duties"". After the German occupation of the Netherlands in May 1940, Ritterbusch was assigned to its administration in June. There he was subordinated as Reichskommissar Arthur Seyss-Inquart's Commissioner for the occupied Netherlands' province of North Brabant, to Commissioner-General for Special Duties, Fritz Schmidt. In a report Schmidt judged him to be ""the best commissioner of the Reichskommissar in Holland"". From October 1941, Ritterbusch was head of Department II B in the Parteikanzlei (""Party Chancellery"") of the NSDAP. Department II B was responsible for the reporting system, propaganda and ""celebration organization"", as well as training issues within the NSDAP. Following Schmidt's death under uncertain circumstances in June 1943, Heinrich Himmler and Martin Bormann agreed to appoint Ritterbusch as his successor as Commissioner-General for Special Duties for the Netherlands. Accordingly, Adolf Hitler appointed Ritterbusch to the position and also as Head of the Netherlands Division of the NSDAP. Ritterbusch was thus directly subordinated to Reichskommissar Arthur Seyss-Inquart as one of his four assistants. After Seyss-Inquart and SS representative Hanns Rauter, Ritterbusch was the third most important NS functionary in the occupation administration of the Netherlands. During his time in office, Ritterbusch's highest rank in the hierarchy of the NSDAP was Hauptdienstleiter (""Head Service Leader""). In 1943, Dutch resistance fighters launched several deadly attacks against leading Dutch National Socialists. On 5 September 1943, Ritterbusch decided secretly, with the Commissioner-Generals Hanns Rauter and Friedrich Wimmer, to introduce assassinations in reprisal for the resistance attacks. Death squads of the Dutch Waffen-SS were formed. These groups led to the formation of Operation Silbertanne (""silver fir"") under Henk Feldmeijer. During Ritterbusch's time in office as Commissioner-General, the influence of the NSDAP party apparatus in the Netherlands was strongly repressed in favour of an expansion of the SS power base in the occupied country. This was precisely what Himmler had set as his goal before Schmidt's appointment. Schmidt had put many obstacles in the way of the SS. Accordingly, Himmler demanded that Schmidt's successor must be a ""strict representative of the Greater Germanic line"". Bormann who, since 1942, had pursued a policy of submissive cooperation between the party and the SS, had bowed to this claim with the appointment of Ritterbusch. At a meeting held in The Hague on 30 July 1943, shortly after Ritterbusch's appointment, he was informed by Seyss-Inquart that unconditional loyalty to the SS leadership was a requirement of his future work. The SS representative, Hanns Albin Rauter, judged Ritterbusch as a ""quiet, very orderly man of a pastoral character"" because of his obedient administration. According to the SS, he refrained from interfering in their ""political shaping"" and was an exponent of the party who favored the politics of the SS. He was viewed as weak and did not cause the SS any difficulties. Bormann also conceded in a later report that Ritterbusch was not very energetic. However, he rejected the idea of Ritterbusch being appointed head of the NSDAP's main archive as proposed by his co-worker Walkenhorst, who characterized him as a ""kind of party philosopher"". In history books, Ritterbusch has also mostly been described as a ""colourless party functionary"".",Normal
"The music of the Star Wars franchise is composed and produced in conjunction with the development of the feature films, television series, and other merchandise within the epic space opera multimedia franchise created by George Lucas. The music for the primary feature films (which serves as the basis for the rest of the related media) was written by John Williams. Williams' work on the series included the scores of nine feature films, a suite and several cues of thematic material for Solo and the theme music for the Galaxy's Edge Theme Park. These count among the most widely known and popular contributions to modern film music, and utilize a symphony orchestra and features an assortment of about fifty recurring musical themes to represent characters and other plot elements: one of the largest caches of themes in the history of film music. Released between 1977 and 2019, the music for the primary feature films was, in the case of the first two trilogies, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and, in select passages, by the London Voices chorus. The sequel trilogy was largely conducted by Williams and William Ross, and performed by the Hollywood Freelance Studio Symphony and (in a few passages) by the Los Angeles Master Chorale. Additional composers have since contributed music to other movies and media within the Star Wars universe. The music for several animated and live-action television series spin-offs has been written by Kevin Kiner, Ludwig Göransson, Natalie Holt, Nicholas Britell, and Ryan Shore. Music for the spin-off films, other television programs, and video games, as well as the trailers of the various installments, were created by various other composers, with this material occasionally revisiting some of Williams' principal themes (and, with one spin-off film, with Williams actually writing a new theme for the composer to use). The scores are primarily performed by a symphony orchestra of varying size joined, in several sections, by a choir of varying size. They each make extensive use of the leitmotif, or a series of musical themes that represents the various characters, objects and events in the films. Throughout all of the franchise, which consists of a total of over 18 hours of music, Williams has written approximately sixty or seventy themes, in one of the largest, richest collection of themes in the history of film music. New London Children's Choir Boy choir (synth) Boy choir (synth) Batu SenerAnthony WillisPaul Mounsey Kevin Kiner composed the score to the film Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008), the predecessor to the animated TV series of the same name. Both properties loosely use some of the original themes and music by John Williams. Kiner's own material for the film includes a theme for Anakin Skywalker's Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano, as well as a theme for Jabba the Hutt's uncle Ziro. Kiner went on to score the TV series' entire seven seasons, which concluded in 2020. A soundtrack album for the first six seasons was released in 2014 by Walt Disney Records and three soundtrack albums for the final season were released in 2020. Kiner continued his work with the franchise for the animated series Star Wars Rebels (2014–2018), which also incorporates Williams' themes. He had later made the score for Star Wars: The Bad Batch (2021–) and Tales of the Jedi (2022–), spin-offs of The Clone Wars. James L. Venable and Paul Dinletir composed the music of Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003–2005) 2D animated series, Ryan Shore serves as the composer for Star Wars: Forces of Destiny (2017–2018) and Star Wars Galaxy of Adventures (2018–2020), and Michael Tavera composes the score to Star Wars Resistance (2018–2020). Matthew Margeson produced the soundtrack for Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures in 2023. Various composers worked on the animated anthology series Star Wars: Visions. A list of LEGO Star Wars tv series & specials and their score composers: For the hand drawn anime short by Studio Ghibli Grogu and Dust Bunnies, Ludwig Göransson composes the score. For the Disney+ series The Mandalorian, Oscar-winner Ludwig Göransson composes the score. For the third season of the series, Joseph Shirley was revealed to be composing the score for the season, replacing Ludwig Göransson. Shirley previously provided additional music for the first two seasons and used Göransson's themes to compose the score for The Book of Boba Fett. For the Disney+ series The Book of Boba Fett, Ludwig Göransson composes the main theme, while Joseph Shirley composes the score. For the Disney+ series Obi-Wan Kenobi, John Williams returned to write the main theme. Natalie Holt composed the rest of the score, making her the first woman to score a live-action Star Wars project. For the Disney+ series Andor, Nicholas Britell composes the score. In April 2023, during Star Wars Celebration London, it was revealed that Kevin Kiner would compose the score for Ahsoka, after previously composing the music for the animated series The Clone Wars, Rebels, The Bad Batch, and Tales of the Jedi. For the game show Jedi Temple Challenge, Gordy Haab composes the score. The scores utilize an eclectic variety of musical styles, many culled from the Late Romantic idiom of Richard Strauss and his contemporaries that itself was incorporated into the Golden Age Hollywood scores of Erich Korngold and Max Steiner. The reasons for this are known to involve George Lucas's desire to allude to the underlying fantasy element of the narrative rather than the science-fiction setting, as well as to ground the otherwise strange and fantastic setting in recognizable, audience-accessible music. Indeed, Lucas maintains that much of the films' success relies not on advanced visual effects, but on the simple, direct emotional appeal of its plot, characters and, importantly, music. Lucas originally wanted to use tracked orchestral and film music in a similar manner to 2001: A Space Odyssey, itself a major inspiration for Star Wars. Williams, who was hired to consult and possibly work on the source music, was advised to form a soundtrack with recurring musical themes to augment the story, while Lucas's choice of music could be used as a temporary track for Williams to base his musical choices on. This resulted in several nods or homages to the music of Gustav Holst, William Walton, Sergei Prokofiev and Igor Stravinsky in the score to Star Wars. Williams relied less and less on references to existing music in the latter eight scores, incorporating more strains of modernist orchestral writing with each progressive score, although occasional nods continue to permeate the music. The score to Revenge of the Sith has clear resemblances to the successful scores of other contemporary composers of the time, namely Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings, Hans Zimmer's Gladiator and Tan Dun's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, with which the movie was most likely scored contemporarily. However, his later scores were otherwise mostly tracked with music of his own composition, mainly from previous Star Wars films. Williams also started to develop his style throughout the various films, incorporating other instruments, unconventional orchestral set-ups (as well as various choral ensembles) and even electronic or electronically attenuated music as the films progressed. Williams often composed the music in a heroic but tongue-in-cheek style, and has described the scored film as a ""musical"". Star Wars was one of the film scores that heralded the revival of grand symphonic scores in the late 1970s. One technique that particularly influenced these scores is Williams' use of the leitmotif, which was most famously associated with Richard Wagner's Der Ring Des Nibelungen and, in early film scores, with Steiner. A leitmotif (or leading motive) is a recurring, evolving musical theme for narrative elements such as characters, locations, ideas, sentiments, objects or other specific part of the film. It is commonly used in modern film scoring as a device for mentally anchoring certain parts of a film to the soundtrack. Of chief importance for a leitmotif is that it must be strong enough for a listener to latch onto while being flexible enough to undergo variation and development along the progression of the story. The more varied and nuanced the use of leitmotif is, the more memorable it typically becomes. A good example of this is the way in which Williams subtly conceals the intervals of ""The Imperial March"" within ""Anakin's Theme"" in The Phantom Menace, implying his dark future to come. Also important is the density in which leitmotifs are used: the more leitmotifs are used in a piece of a given length, the more thematically rich it is considered to be. Film music, however, typically needs to strike a balance between the number of leitmotives used, so as to not become too dense for the audience (being preoccupied with the visuals) to follow. Williams' music of Star Wars is unique in that it is relatively dense for film scoring, with approximately 17 themes used in each two-hour film, of which about 90% is scored. Williams re-recorded some of his suites from the first trilogy with the Skywalker Symphony Orchestra as an album. Several of his later themes were released as singles and music videos, and were later released a collection of suites from the six films as a compilation that played to a series of clips from the films, with sparse dialogue and sound effects. These became the basis for a series of hour-long concerts which featured Star Wars music to images from the films, Star Wars: In Concert, which took place in 2009 and 2010. First performed in London, it went on to tour across the United States and Canada, last playing in London, Ontario, Canada on July 25, 2010. The scores of the first trilogy (in the form of its Blu-Ray release) and The Force Awakens are performed as Live to Projection concerts, but with greatly reduced forces. The performances follow the music of the finished film, with some of the music looped, tracked or omitted entirely, and do not feature any of the diegetic pieces and often omit the choral parts. John Williams sketched the score for his various orchestrations and wrote the music for a full symphony orchestra (ranging from 79 to 113 players overall  Archived June 16, 2020, at the Wayback Machine The Empire Strikes Back required 104 players, not including the conductor or synthesizer (rhttp:www.jw-collection.descorestesblp.htmecalls Archived August 7, 2017, at the Wayback Machine) due to the inclusion of a fourth flute, and sections that required a third harp, five oboes overall, an added piccolo and eight percussionists overall. If the Empire Strikes Back is to augmented with the string section size of Revenge of the Sith or the Skywalker Symphony Recording, it would require about 112 players and a small women choir. A Star Wars in Concert production that would follow the orchestration of the recording, would have to feature some of the expansions of the various episodes, requiring about 110 players, as well as the mixed choir and possibly the bass choir.<ref>) and, in several passages, chorus (ranging from 12 to 120 singers overall) and a few non-orchestral instruments. The orchestration is not consistent throughout the different films, but generally, the score makes use of a considerable brass section over a comparatively smaller string section, giving the series its heraldic, brassy sound. Several of the scores require larger forces, including a large (over 100-piece) romantic-period orchestra, a mixed choir and even a boy choir, although none of the scores call for particularly immense forces compared to larger film or theater works. Nevertheless, due to added high woodwinds and percussion parts, scores such as Empire Strikes Back and Attack of the Clones call for 106 and 110 players, respectively. The former called for a third harp and fourth bassoon, while the latter (and all prequel scores) utilized a fuller string section. Revenge of the Sith also utilized a second set of timpani. Comparatively, the original Star Wars trilogy and the sequel trilogy films call for much smaller forces of as little as 82 players, and small choral accompaniment in select cues. The first spin-off film, Rogue One, followed the prequel trilogy's instrumentation, using a 110-piece orchestra and 90-piece mixed choir. In live performances, the forces are usually greatly reduced: Official Star Wars Concerts were held with as little as 60-piece orchestras and 50-piece mixed choral ensembles or with the choir omitted altogether.  However, to recreate the nine scores as they were originally recorded, the following instrumentation would be needed: John Williams wrote a series of themes and motifs for certain characters and ideas in each of the Star Wars films. The multiple installments allowed Williams to compose some sixty or seventy themes and reprise some of them extensively, continually developing them over a long period of screen time. Williams introduces a considerable, but manageable number of themes in each episode (seven themes on average), attempting to compose main themes that are distinct, long-lined and memorable. Connections between the themes are formed for narrative purposes or, more generally, in the favour of cohesion. As a result, some of the themes play very often: the Force Theme plays over one hundred times in the series. Each score can be said to have a ""main theme"", which is developed and repeated frequently throughout the film, and represents the high and low points of the film itself as much as they do narrative elements within the film: for instance, the frequent use of The Imperial March in Empire Strikes Back. Besides the main theme and a handful of other principal themes, Williams forged several smaller motifs for each episode, which are generally not as memorable and at times interchangeable. As a result of his compositional process, a large number of incidental musical material and themes that are specific to certain setpieces also occur throughout the piece. Williams had designated the music of the main titles to be the main theme of the series as a whole, but there is not necessarily a main theme for each trilogy. Instead, each trilogy (and to a lesser extent, each film) has its own style or soundscape. Williams' Star Wars catalog remains one of the largest collections of leitmotifs in the history of cinema, although – for comparison – it still falls short of Wagner's use of leitmotifs in the Ring Cycle or even Howard Shore's work on the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings films. Both works feature many more themes for a similar or shorter running time; and use the themes with greater specificity and variation; where Williams prefers to write fewer themes (to allow him to focus on them better) and use them in a more straightforward manner and sometimes, solely for their romantic effect. Shore and Wagner's themes are also inter-related and arranged into sets of subsets of related themes through various melodic or harmonic connections, whereas Williams prefers greater distinction between his themes. Williams scores the films one episode at a time and attempts to base each score on new material as much as possible. Therefore, the Imperial March makes no appearance in the original Star Wars, since Williams did not conceive of it until he was scoring The Empire Strikes Back, and the same is true of Across the Stars and The Phantom Menace. Other themes get abandoned, like the Droid motive from The Empire Strikes Back or the original Imperial motives of the original Star Wars. Between trilogies, Williams had often changed his way of using leitmotives, moving from long-lined melodies in the classic trilogy to shorter, more rhythmic ideas in the prequel trilogy. Williams does not always use his themes in a strictly narrative sense. In almost each entry, he will occasionally use a theme seemingly at random, purely because its mood fits the scene. Princess Leia's Theme is used for the death of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original Star Wars, which has little to do with her character even though she is present in the scene. Yoda's Theme appears several times during the Cloud City sequences in The Empire Strikes Back. The concert piece Duel of the Fates is used several times throughout the prequel trilogy, appearing over the entire final battle in The Phantom Menace (as opposed to just the lightsaber duel for which it was written); Anakin Skywalker's search for his mother in Attack of the Clones; and the unrelated Yoda and Darth Sidious's duel in Revenge of the Sith. Williams' original composition for the Geonosis Battle Arena in Attack of the Clones, a variation on the Droid Army March, was used for the Utapau assault in Revenge of the Sith. Multiple uses of the Force Theme are also non-thematic. This also happens through the use of tracked music. Attack of the Clones, the first film to be shot digitally, had major edits made after the scoring process, leading to the inclusion of tracked music over many of the digitally created sequences such as the Droid Factory on Geonosis or the Clone Army's arrival to the battle. These scenes used music such as Yoda's theme or incidental music from The Phantom Menace with little dramatic connection to what is occurring on screen. Musical similarities exist between the final scenes of The Phantom Menace with Finn's confession to Rey in The Force Awakens, probably a result of temp-track choice. In other cases, the material was not tracked but rather lifted from the original composition and re-recorded, such as in the big action scenes of Return of the Jedi, both of which lift material from the Battle of Yavin and Ben's death. Other composers to have used Williams' themes in spinoff materials have likewise sometimes used them loosely. Over the long period in which the films were made, many of the themes changed their initial meaning: By the time of The Empire Strikes Back, the Luke Skywalker material and the theme of Old Ben were already rebranded as the ""Star Wars Main theme"" and ""The Force Theme"", respectively, by Williams. The Rebel Fanfare (initially, the fanfare of the Blockade Runner) eventually turned into the theme of the Millennium Falcon. Listed below are about 67 leitmotives, based on primarily on Williams own notes and Frank Lehman's extensive catalogue, but also on Doug Adams et al analyses of the scores. Along with two themes Williams composed for Solo and two more for Galaxy's Edge, his work of the series had accrued as many as 71 leitmotives. The main new theme of each entry is highlighted: Returning: Star Wars Theme, Star Wars Secondary Theme, Rebel Fanfare, The Force, Princess Leia, Rebel Victory Returning: Spaceship Dogfight Motif; Star Wars Theme, Secondary Star Wars Theme, Rebel Fanfare, The Force, Leia, the Imperial March, Han Solo and the Princess, Yoda Returning: Star Wars Theme, Stars Wars Secondary Theme, The Rebel Fanfare, The Force Theme, The Imperial March, Yoda's Theme, Jabba's Theme, The Emperor's Theme Returning: Shmi's Theme; Star Wars Theme, Star Wars Secondary Theme, The Rebel Fanfare, The Force Theme, The Imperial March, The Emperor's Theme, Young Anakin's Theme, Droid Invasion March, Duel of the Fates Returning: Jedi Funeral Theme, Coruscant Fanfare; Star Wars Theme, Secondary Star Wars Theme, Leia's theme, The Rebel Fanfare, The Force Theme, The Imperial March, The Emperor's Theme, Young Anakin's Theme, Descent, Droid Invasion March, Duel of the Fates, Shmi, Across the Stars, Across the Stars (embryonic), Dark Side Returning: Star Wars Theme, Secondary Star Wars Theme, Millennium Falcon, The Force theme, Leia's Theme, The Imperial March, Han Solo and the Princess Returning: Star Wars Theme, Secondary Star Wars Theme, Millennium Falcon, The Force Theme, Leia's Theme, Yoda's Theme, Luke and Leia, Han Solo and the Princess, The Imperial March, Spaceship Dogfight Motif, Death Star motif, The Emperor's Theme, Poe's Theme, Rey's Themes, Kylo Ren's themes, First Order, Tension figure, Snoke's Theme, Jedi Steps Returning: Star Wars Theme, Secondary Star Wars Theme, Millennium Falcon, The Force Theme, Leia's Theme, Han Solo and the Princess, The Imperial March, The Emperor's Theme, Poe's Theme, Rey's Themes, Kylo Ren's themes, March of the Resistance, Luke and Leia, Yoda's Theme, Dark Side, Tension figure Since neither Williams nor his office ever provided a full list of the leitmotifs used in every Star Wars film, there is some controversy around the exact number of themes, with some taking an inclusive approach that identifies various leitmotifs, even where the composer probably never intended for, and others taking an exclusive, reductive approach. Some of the more inclusive analyses identify themes that do not actually recur either in discrete cues nor even strewn across one long stretch of music. This is the result of Williams' propensity (in these scores and otherwise) to write material that is either melodic, rhythmic, harmonic or timbral specifically to an individual setpiece or none-recurring plot-element in the film, such as The Battle of Hoth, the Chase through Coruscant, or The Battle of Crait. These individual pieces of music – whether they consist of a full melody, ostinati, diegetic pieces or a certain timbre – have sometimes been described as having thematic significance, occasionally (in fleeting comments) even by Williams himself, but since they do not recur in a different part of the narrative, nor are transformed from or into another motif, they do not comply with the definition of a leitmotif. Even when some of these figures do recur, it is often unclear whether they are substantial enough to be assigned with thematic significance, as these instances often includes material that is incidental in nature, such as several figures used in the finale of The Empire Strikes Back; material that is purely rhythmic or timbral like various ""bouncing"" horn figures for Luke's landspeeder search in the original Star Wars, material that is of a generic nature, such as his use of ""mournful homophonic"" choir in The Last Jedi for climactic moments; or material that is part of Williams' stylistic choices as a composer, more than a thematic statement unique to the series. For instance, his use of tritones often denotes mystery, a device he uses for the droids landing on Tatooine and again in the concert arrangement of ""The Throne Room."" In fact, sometimes the supposedly recurring material is similar, but not in fact identical. A good example would be the variety of gestures relating to the dark side, following a piece of music used in the opera-house scene. Lehamn however clarifies that those alleged following statements are ""similar but inexact"" to the earlier gesture. Sometimes, the recurring material is question is not part of the original composition but is rather tracked after-the-fact, or at least lifted, from existing material into a different section of the film, or from material that is recapitulated in a concert piece or end-credits suite. This includes the Podracing fanfare and the ostinato accompaniment of the Rebel Fanfare, which otherwise does not appear isolated from the unabridged theme more than once; the mournful writing for French horn at Shmi's funeral, the Arena March from Attack of the Clones etc. The first Star Wars Anthology score for Rogue One, written by Michael Giacchino, utilizes several themes (and recurring interstitial material) from John Williams, mostly for their Romantic sweep (such as The Force Theme and hints of the Main Theme). It has its own catalog of themes, independent from Williams' material, including a new, third theme for the Empire, although Giacchino also quotes both the original Imperial Motif and The Imperial March. Returning: Luke's Theme, Rebel Fanfare, The Force Theme, Leia's Theme, Imperial Motif, Death Star Motif, The Imperial March  For Solo, John Williams wrote and recorded a concert arrangement for a new theme for Han Solo. In the process of composing the theme, Williams ended up using two separate ideas, each conveying a different aspect of the character, and went as far as to spot the film for places to use each motif; all other leitmotifs and other material were written and adapted by John Powell, the main composer for the film. Returning: Spaceship Dogfight motif, Star Wars Theme, Millennium Falcon theme, Duel of the Fates, The Imperial March, The Imperial motif, Death Star Motif, The Asteroid Field, Imperial Cruiser Pursuit, Droids Motif By John Williams: By John Powell: Instead of offering a full recording release of a particular film, Williams typically releases a condensed score on album, in which the music is arranged out of the film order and more within the veins of a concert program. These album releases typically include several concert suites, written purely for the end credits or the album itself, where a specific theme is developed continuously throughout the piece. Williams also re-edited some of his existing cues after the fact in order to ""concertize"" theme on the behest of conductors such as Charles Gerhardt. Five of the eight films also have unique credit suites that feature alternate concert arrangements of themes andor a medley of the main themes of a particular film.

In addition to the orchestral scope that was brought on by John Williams' musical score, the Star Wars franchise also features many distinguishing diegetic songs that enrich the detail of the audio mise-en-scène. Some of this diegetic music was written by John Williams; some by his son, Joseph; and some by various other people.

"Mohabbat Tujhe Alvida (Urdu: محبّت تجھے الوداع, lit. 'Farewell To You Love') is a Pakistani melodrama television series produced by Barkat Siddiqi and Zayed Sheikh. It stars Zahid Ahmed, Sonya Hussain, and Mansha Pasha in lead roles. The show is loosely based on the folk tale of Lila Chanesar. Ulfat (Sonya Hussyn) belongs to a middle-class family and dreams of becoming rich. She meets Shafaq (Mansha Pasha) who is a rich businesswoman and, in order for Ulfat to succeed in her dreams, she chooses to risk her marital life, causing many problems for her. In November 2018, it was revealed that Barkat Siddiqui is working on a project called Aye Dil Zara Sambhal. The title of the show was later changed to Mohabbat Tujhe Alvida. Zahid Ahmed was cast in the lead role. He played the role of Shahaan, an average middle-class man who is working hard to create comfort in the lives of his wife Ulfat (played by Sonya Hussain) and children. Mansha Pasha played the character of Shafaq, a rich and glamorous girl. The role was initially offered to Armeena Khan but due to unknown reasons, probably date clashes, she was replaced by Pasha. It was Mansha Pasha and Zahid Ahmed's second on-screen appearance together after Tau Dil Ka Kiya Hua while Zahid also collaborated with Sonya Hussain for the second time after Ishq Zahe Naseeb. After the release of the first and second teaser, the show was heavily criticised for its typical melodramatic story. The viewers also called it a copy of the Indian film Judaai to which Pasha clarified and responded that ""the show may be inspired but we have our own folktales"", and hinted the show was based on Lilan Chanesar by showing the details of the article. The title song of Mohabbat Tujhe Alvida was composed and performed by musician Sahir Ali Bagga with Afshan Fawad being in the chorus. Lyrics for the song were given by Major Imran Raza. It marked Bagga's return to Hum TV, since he performed the channel's Deewar-e-Shab's title song ""Kya Hai Ishq"" in 2019. The first half of the soundtrack was released on 12 June and the complete OST released on 17 June 2020.",Normal

"The National Police of Honduras (founded 5 January 1888) is the uniformed police force of the Republic of Honduras. The force is organised into regional headquarters, municipal headquarters, headquarters of fixed or mobile stations, and police posts. There are at least 360 police centres throughout Honduras. The National Police of Honduras has its headquarters in Tegucigalpa, the capital city of Honduras. The National Police of Honduras is the fourth largest police body in Central America by number of employees (more than Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Belize). It is the sixth largest force in Central America by police officers per capita. The force's patroness is the Virgin of Carmen. On 16 July of each year the ""National Police Patroness Day"" is celebrated. In 1866, the ruling general in Honduras, José María Medina made the ""Law of Rural Police"". A group of men were given powers similar to those of a Justice of the peace. This group of officers was later called the ""Body of the Gendarmerie"". In December 1881, the president of the republic, Marco Aurelio Soto, instituted the ""Police of the Line"" in Tegucigalpa and Comayagüela. There was a Commandant, a sub-commander, an assistant, four sergeants, and five policemen. On 15 January 1882, by order of President Marco Aurelio Soto, the National Police of Honduras was established. On 14 September 1888, the acting president, General Luis Bográn, issued a decree that a port police unit be formed. The new unit became operational on 1 January 1890. In the 1930s, the first National Directorate of Criminal Investigation was formed and in 1933, a division of traffic policing was created. In 1957, government and military relations in Honduras began to deteriorate. In June 1959, the National Police of Honduras was replaced by the ""Civil Guard"", a paramilitary force with policing duties. The 1963 Honduran coup d'état led by Colonel Arming Velásquez Cerrato and Oswaldo López Arellano removed President Ramón Villeda Morales from power. On 9 October 1963, the Special Security Corps (CES) was formed by Chief of State Arellano. The first director of the CES was General Alonzo Flores Guerra. Rural and highway patrol units were formed. In 1969, during the Football War (conflict between Honduras and El Salvador), the CES fought on the side of the Honduras army. In 1974, a unit for the policing of inland revenue was created. On 30 January 1975, the CES was disbanded and ""FUSEP"", a public security force, was formed as a branch of the military. The officers of FUSEP were outfitted in green uniforms and armed with regulation 9mm Browning Hi-Power pistols and FN FAL (Rifle Automatique Léger) 7.62×51mm calibre NATO rifles. From 1982, Honduras returned to civil rule and the police force was to be separated from the military. However, at the time, the police force kept some military characteristics. It operated under the auspices of the Office of National Defense and Public Security (SDNSP) and under the authority of the director of the FFAA, who was a representative of the president. There was continuation of a National Directorate of Investigation (DNI). The commander-in-chief, a general, was a graduate of the General José Trinidad Cabañas National Police Academy of Honduras (ANAPO), and sometimes of the National Police University of Honduras (UNPH). On 4 January 1982, the Captain José Santos Guardiola Centre for Police Instruction (CIP-CJSG) (the Police Technical Institute (ITP-CJSG)) was established. In July 1984, the School for Qualification of Police Officials (ECOP) (""Upper Institute of Police Education"" (ISEP)) was established. In 1993, a new division, the Directorate General of Criminal Investigation (DGIC) was created. On 17 December 1996, by Decree Number 229-96, Congress ordered the transfer of the police force to civil control. The governing body was a board chaired by Hernán Corrales Padilla. The board members were lawyers Jorge Ponce Turcios, Francisco Cardona Argüelles, Germán Leitzelar Vidaurreta, Felipe Elvir Sierra, José Zamora Bados, and the engineer, Alfredo Landaverde. On 28 May 1998, by Decree Number 156-98, the ""Organic Law of the National Police"" (LOPN) was created. The governing civil body was the Secretariat of State in the Dispatch of Security. The decree was administered by Hernán Corrales Padilla (1924 - 1999). On 22 May 2012, the General Director of the Honduran National Police, Juan Carlos Bonilla Valladares, known as ""El Tigre"" was appointed. On 19 December 2013, Valladares left office, replaced by Ramón Antonio Sabillón Pineda. In 1997, during the presidency of Carlos Roberto Reina, the Fuerza de Seguridad Pública, FUSEP (public security force) changed to civilian governance. In 1998, the president, Carlos Roberto Flores, and the National Congress of Honduras, passed legislation that would establish a new National Police of Honduras. The new force was formed by 2001. On April 30, 2020, DEA Special Operations Division Special Agent in Charge Wendy Woolcock and United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey S. Berman charged former chief of Honduran National Police Juan Carlos Bonilla Valladares, aka “El Tigre,” in a Manhattan federal court with drug trafficking and weapons offenses involving the use and possession of machineguns and destructive devices. Woolcock claimed that during his time of the chief of police, “Juan Carlos Bonilla Valladares allegedly used his high ranking position to influence those working for him and violently protect the politically connected drug traffickers who would smuggle cocaine destined for the United States.” It was revealed that Honduran law enforcement officials, as well as politicians, had been working with numerous drug traffickers in Honduras since 2003. The National Police of Honduras operates under the legal framework of the ""Organic Law of the National Police"". Article 293 of the Constitution of Honduras by Decree 136-1995 and Decree 229-1996 in addition to Article 22 of its Organic Law by Decree No. 67-200815 defines the work of the National Police. The National Police of Honduras is governed by the office of the Director General of the National Police (DGPN). There is oversight by the Office of Security (one of sixteen secretariats of the Executive Branch of the government) headed by the Minister of Security. In 2010, the Office of Security operated with a budget of Lps. 3,129,454,629 (US$165.143 million). The main division of the force, the ""Dirección Nacional de la Policía Preventiva"", DNPP (preventive policing unit) had the highest expenditure at about Lps. 1.333.687.852 (US$70.3 million). The National Police of Honduras has six divisions or ""National Directorates"". They are: The SEP includes four units: the National Police University of Honduras (UNPH), the Police Technological Institute (ITP), the National Police Academy (ANAPO) and the School of Sub-Officers (ESO). The DNPP combats crimes related to organized crime, such as smuggling, fraud or tax evasion and implements police controls on taxes. It combats the production, use, possession and illegal trafficking of arms and drugs. It enforces the legal order of transportation, transit and roads, and exercises security functions in immigration matters. The DNPP is managed by officers with a degree in Police Science. The officers receive an undergraduate degree from the National Police University of Honduras (UPNH), and the rank of Sub-Inspector of Police. The uniforms, patrol cars, Galil pistols and regulation rifles of the officers are colored blue. The division also has ""Falcon"" Bell 206 JetRanger helicopters at their disposal in an air unit. The DNIC was developed with training and instructors from Scotland Yard (UK), Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement Administration (US), and Mossad (Israel). This unit utilizes regulation weapons including the 9mm calibre Glock, the Remington shotgun, and the IMI Galil rifle. A Director General and a representative of the Public Ministry of Honduras work together as heads of the DNIC. A forensic physician from the Faculty of Forensic Sciences is associated with the DNIC. Within the DNIC unit is the DGIC unit (DPI). It drafts eighteen-year-old men and women who have just completed secondary or university education to become detectives. The head of the unit is an officer of the rank of commissioner or an inspector. Each unit also has agents who are crime scene technicians, crime scene investigators, violent crime scene technicians, analysts, ballistic analysts, specialists in reconstruction, field inspection, computer crime, drug related crime and graphics and drafting. The Comando de Operaciones Especiales COECO (""special operations command"" or ""Cobras"") are an elite unit of Honduran police agents skilled in managing riots and disturbances, sniper shooting, and tactical and special operations. The unit trains with American SWAT units. On 26 July 2012, legislation was passed for the creation of the TIGRES, ""Intelligence Troop and Special Security Response Groups"" or ""Tigers"". The TIGRES counters organized crime and hooliganism, in conjunction with judges and public prosecutors. The TIGERS are trained for several months by instructors from the US Army Special Forces and members of the JUNGLAS unit of the Colombian National Police, with the support of the US government. On 1 September 2015, President Juan Orlando Hernández formally opened a new police investigation unit, the DPI. The DPI works in regional headquarters including San Pedro Sula, La Ceiba, Santa Rosa de Copán, Comayagua and Choluteca. Crime in Honduras is related to social instability, an increase in gangs, and youth unemployment, and availability of firearms.

"Kookmin University (Korean:국민대학교, IPA:; Hanja:國民大學校) is a private research university established in 1946 in Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, South Korea. It has historic significance, as it was founded during by the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea and is the first private university founded after the liberation of the Republic of Korea from Japan. Prominent Korean independence activists Kim Gu, Jo So-ang and Shin Ik-hui are strongly associated with the university. In 1959, the SsangYong Group acquired the university. It has around 22,000 students and 350 administrative staff are working at the university's 800 faculties. Since its establishment in 1946, approximately 60,000 students have graduated. The KMU consists of 14 undergraduate colleges, several postgraduate schools, and 10 professional-technical schools. The university provides degree programs, scholarships, and conferences. The international rank and reputation has been improving. Kookmin University was established by the Korean government-in-exile based in Shanghai during the Japanese occupation of Korea. Shin Ik-hui became the first president of the university. He went on to serve the country as the first House Speaker of the National Assembly. In 1959, Sunggon ""Sungkok"" Kim, the founder of the SsangYong Group, took over the university and now produces research. Kookmin University's academic programs are organized into undergraduate colleges, graduate schools, professional, and special schools. It is the first school that created the Department of Automotive Engineering among four-year universities in Korea. The Kookmin University Graduate School consists of departments within five main areas of study: Humanities & Social Studies, Natural Science, Engineering, Arts & Physical Education and Interdisciplinary Programs. Sungkok library was founded at the opening of Kookmin University in December 1946. It moved to its current location in the Jeongneung-dong building in 1971. A new space was built with the support of the SsangYong Group, and was named after its founder Kim Sunggon, also known as Sungkok. The library has a database and 7 million books, multimedia data, 2000 kinds of internal and external scholarly journals, 50000 kinds of foreign journals (21 DBs), 1300 online journals, 52000 e-Books, and 2700 seats in cubicles. Myungwon house is affiliated with Kookmin University and has been designated as Seoul National Treasure No.7. The house was the residence of Han Kyu-seol, who was the Mayor of Seoul and the Minister of Political Affairs during the late Joseon dynasty. In 1980, on the verge of demolition due to the urban redevelopment of central Seoul, it was donated by the family of the former owner, the late Joon Hyuk Park and his eldest son Hyo Jong Henry Park to the late Kim Myoungwon, Mee Hee, and then reconstructed at the present site adjacent to Kookmin University.

"Hanson Tamba Boakai (born 28 October 1996) is a professional soccer player who plays as a midfielder. Born a Liberian refugee in Guinea, he has represented Canada at youth level. He holds the record for the youngest player ever to appear in a NASL game at the age of 16 years and 231 days, taking the record away from his former coach, Colin Miller. Boakai was born to Liberian parents in Teldou, a small southwestern village in Guinea located a short distance from the border with Sierra Leone. He moved to Edmonton, Alberta, when he was seven years old. Before joining FC Edmonton's reserves, Boakai played for Xtreme FC. He joined FC Edmonton in 2011 after trying-out with the side. After spending two years with the reserves, Boakai was signed professional by FC Edmonton of the North American Soccer League on 20 February 2013, becoming the youngest player ever signed by an NASL side. On 16 June 2013 Boakai made his professional debut for Edmonton against the Carolina Railhawks in which he came on in the 65th minute for Sadi Jalali and at the same time becoming the youngest ever player to play an NASL game. Edmonton drew the game 1–1. Boakai scored his first goal for FC Edmonton against Ottawa Fury FC in the 2014 Canadian Championship. FC Edmonton won the game 3–1 and advanced to the semi-finals. Boakai scored his first goal in the NASL against the San Antonio Scorpions in a 4–0 win on 5 July 2015. His contract with FC Edmonton expired at the end of the 2015 season. In February 2016, Boakai signed a contract until the end of the season with Croatian Second Division club NK Dugopolje. On 11 July 2016, Boakai signed with Landskrona, who play in Division 1 Södra, the third tier of football in Sweden, which was to run through 2017 November. In November 2016, Landskrona announced that Boakai's contract was terminated. After almost a year without contract, Boakai signed with Romanian Liga II side UTA Arad in October 2017. Due to visa issues, Boakai was unable to appear for UTA for over a month before making his debut on 10 November 2017 as a 71st-minute substitute in a 2-1 loss to Târgu Mureș. Boakai joined Finnish Ykkönen side Ekenäs IF on 16 March 2018. Made his first appearance 14 April 2018. He scored his first goal for the club against FC KTP on 26 June 2018. At the end of the season, Ekenäs picked up Boakai's option for the 2019 season. Boakai would score 6 goals and add 6 assists for Ekenäs in 2018. After one season with Ekenäs, Boakai would be transferred to Veikkausliiga side Inter Turku for the 2019 season, with a contract option for the 2020 season. On 4 December 2019, Boakai signed for the second time with his youth club FC Edmonton, now playing in the Canadian Premier League. He made his first appearance for the Eddies since 2015 on August 16, 2020 against Forge FC Boakai had played for the Canada U15 soccer side while with the Edmonton reserves. He then played for the Canada U17 during the 2013 CONCACAF U-17 Championship, scoring against Costa Rica U17 and Jamaica U17 sides as Canada managed to make it the semi-finals and thus qualify for the 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Boakai continued to represent Canada at the U20 level and was a part of the team that traveled to Northern Ireland for the 2014 Milk Cup. After a strong showing for the youth sides, and a continued presence with Edmonton, Canada coach Benito Floro called up Boakai to the senior team for a friendly against Colombia in October 2014. He did not play, however. In September 2019, Boakai was called up to the Liberia national team for a friendly against Botswana.",Normal
"In statistics, confirmatory composite analysis (CCA) is a sub-type of structural equation modeling (SEM). Although, historically, CCA emerged from a re-orientation and re-start of partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM), it has become an independent approach and the two should not be confused. In many ways it is similar to, but also quite distinct from confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). It shares with CFA the process of model specification, model identification, model estimation, and model assessment. However, in contrast to CFA which always assumes the existence of latent variables, in CCA all variables can be observable, with their interrelationships expressed in terms of composites, i.e., linear compounds of subsets of the variables. The composites are treated as the fundamental objects and path diagrams can be used to illustrate their relationships. This makes CCA particularly useful for disciplines examining theoretical concepts that are designed to attain certain goals, so-called artifacts, and their interplay with theoretical concepts of behavioral sciences. The initial idea of CCA was sketched by Theo K. Dijkstra and Jörg Henseler in 2014. The scholarly publishing process took its time until the first full description of CCA was published by Florian Schuberth, Jörg Henseler and Theo K. Dijkstra in 2018. As common for statistical developments, interim developments of CCA were shared with the scientific community in written form. Moreover, CCA was presented at several conferences including the 5th Modern Modeling Methods Conference, the 2nd International Symposium on Partial Least Squares Path Modeling, the 5th CIM Community Workshop, and the Meeting of the SEM Working Group in 2018. A composite is typically a linear combination of observable random variables. However, also so-called second-order composites as linear combinations of latent variables and composites, respectively, are conceivable. For a random column vector x {displaystyle mathbf {x} } of observable variables that is partitioned into sub-vectors x i {displaystyle mathbf {x} _{i}} , composites can be defined as weighted linear combinations. So the i-th composite c i {displaystyle c_{i}} equals: where the weights of each composite are appropriately normalized (see Confirmatory composite analysis#Model identification). In the following, it is assumed that the weights are scaled in such a way that each composite has a variance of one, i.e., w i ′ Σ i i w i {displaystyle mathbf {w} _{i}'mathbf {Sigma } _{ii}mathbf {w} _{i}} . Moreover, it is assumed that the observable random variables are standardized having a mean of zero and a unit variance. Generally, the variance-covariance matrices Σ i i {displaystyle mathbf {Sigma } _{ii}} of the sub-vectors are not constrained beyond being positive definite. Similar to the latent variables of a factor model, the composites explain the covariances between the sub-vectors leading to the following inter-block covariance matrix: where ρ i j {displaystyle rho _{ij}} is the correlation between the composites c j {displaystyle c_{j}} and c i {displaystyle c_{i}} . The composite model imposes rank one constraints on the inter-block covariance matrices Σ i j {displaystyle mathbf {Sigma } _{ij}} , i.e., rank ( Σ i j ) = 1 {displaystyle {text{rank}}(mathbf {Sigma } _{ij})=1} . Generally, the variance-covariance matrix of x {displaystyle mathbf {x} } is positive definite iff the correlation matrix of the composites R := ( ρ i j ) {displaystyle mathbf {R} :=(rho _{ij})} and the variance-covariance matrices Σ j j {displaystyle mathbf {Sigma } _{jj}} 's are both positive definite. In addition, the composites can be related via a structural model which constrains the correlation matrix R {displaystyle mathbf {R} } indirectly via a set of simultaneous equations: where the vector c {displaystyle mathbf {c} } is partitioned in an exogenous and an endogenous part, and the matrices B {displaystyle mathbf {B} } and C {displaystyle mathbf {C} } contain the so-called path (and feedback) coefficients. Moreover, the vector z {displaystyle mathbf {z} } contains the structural error terms having a zero mean and being uncorrelated with c exogenous {displaystyle mathbf {c} _{text{exogenous}}} . As the model needs not to be recursive, the matrix B {displaystyle mathbf {B} } is not necessarily triangular and the elements of z {displaystyle mathbf {z} } may be correlated. To ensure identification of the composite model, each composite must be correlated with at least one variable not forming the composite. Additionally to this non-isolation condition, each composite needs to be normalized, e.g., by fixing one weight per composite, the length of each weight vector, or the composite’s variance to a certain value. If the composites are embedded in a structural model, also the structural model needs to be identified. Finally, since the weight signs are still undetermined, it is recommended to select a dominant indicator per block of indicators that dictates the orientation of the composite. The degrees of freedom of the basic composite model, i.e., with no constraints imposed on the composites' correlation matrix R {displaystyle mathbf {R} } , are calculated as follows: To estimate the parameters of a composite model, various methods that create composites can be used such as approaches to generalized canonical correlation, principal component analysis, and linear discriminant analysis. Moreover, a maximum-likelihood estimator and composite-based methods for SEM such as partial least squares path modeling and generalized structured component analysis can be employed to estimate weights and the correlations among the composites. In CCA, the model fit, i.e., the discrepancy between the estimated model-implied variance-covariance matrix Σ ^ {displaystyle {hat {mathbf {Sigma } }}} and its sample counterpart S {displaystyle mathbf {S} } , can be assessed in two non-exclusive ways. On the one hand, measures of fit can be employed; on the other hand, a test for overall model fit can be used. While the former relies on heuristic rules, the latter is based on statistical inferences. Fit measures for composite models comprises statistics such as the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), and the root mean squared error of outer residuals (RMS θ {displaystyle _{theta }} ) In contrast to fit measures for common factor models, fit measures for composite models are relatively unexplored and reliable thresholds still need to be determined. To assess the overall model fit by means of statistical testing, the bootstrap test for overall model fit, also known as Bollen-Stine bootstrap test, can be used to investigate whether a composite model fits to the data. Besides the originally proposed CCA, the evaluation steps known from partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) are dubbed CCA. It is emphasized that PLS-SEM's evaluation steps, in the following called PLS-CCA, differ from CCA in many regards:. (i) While PLS-CCA aims at conforming reflective and formative measurement models, CCA aims at assessing composite models; (ii) PLS-CCA omits overall model fit assessment, which is a crucial step in CCA as well as SEM; (iii) PLS-CCA is strongly linked to PLS-PM, while for CCA PLS-PM can be employed as one estimator, but this is in no way mandatory. Hence, researchers who employ need to be aware to which technique they are referring to.",Normal
"The title Lord Duffus was created by Charles II in the Peerage of Scotland on 8 December 1650 for Alexander Sutherland. He was a descendant of the 4th Earl of Sutherland, who fell in battle in 1333. The title is now extinct, although there may be male-line Sutherlands descended from earlier lairds of Duffus. In 1734, the 3rd Lord was attainted and the lordship was forfeited. His son Eric tried but failed to get a reverse of the attainder. His son James Sutherland of Duffus got the attainder reversed, and was restored to the lordship as 4th (titular 5th) Lord Duffus on 25 May 1826. The last two Lords Duffus were also baronets, of Hempriggs in the County of Caithness (3rd and 4th). The lordship became extinct on the death of the 6th (titular 7th) Lord Duffus on 28 August 1875. The Sutherland family of Duffus descended from Nicholas Sutherland, only brother of William de Moravia, 5th Earl of Sutherland (d. 1370), and younger son of Kenneth de Moravia, 4th Earl of Sutherland. The village of Duffus is outside of the county of Sutherland, but the Sutherlands of Duffus also held lands within Sutherland, most notably Skelbo. Some of the Sutherland of Duffus family may have assumed the surname Duffus, which was the family title instead of the surname Sutherland. These are the early ancestors of the Lords Duffus. Information on the Lords Duffus was obtained in part from the Sutherland history (below), and from Elinor Glyn (1955), a memoir by her grandson Anthony Glyn. Glyn and her sister Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon were born Sutherlands, descended from David Sutherland, Laird of Cambusavie, allegedly a son of Alexander Sutherland, a younger brother of the Jacobite 3rd Lord Duffus, who is described in The Scots Peerage as having died without issue. The fact that the 6th Lord Duffus inherited in 1827 over the now Canadian Sutherlands, who sold their estates in the 1770s to the Earl of Sutherland, probably means that the relationship was more distant, or if the same, that the Laird of Cambusavie was illegitimate.",Normal

"Sillian is a market town in the district of Lienz, in the Austrian state of Tyrol. The municipality, at a height of about 1,100m (3,600ft), is the main settlement in the East Tyrolean Hochpustertal, the eastern part of the Puster Valley, stretching from Lienz up to the border with South Tyrol, Italy, in the west. The settlement is situated north of the upper Drava river, on the sunny slopes of the Villgraten Mountains. In the south, the valley stretches to the Lienz Dolomites and the Carnic Alps. The weather in Sillian is extremely changeable due to its location, and it can quickly change from warm and balmy to sub-zero. The area belonged to the estates granted by Duke Tassilo III of Bavaria to Innichen Abbey in 769. First mentioned about 1000, the estates of Silano were held by the Meinhardiner counts of Gorizia from the 13th century onwards. The parish church was consecrated in 1326. Count Leonhard of Gorizia vested the citizens with market privileges in 1469. Upon the extinction of the line in 1500, Sillian was seized by the House of Habsburg king Maximilian I and incorporated into the County of Tyrol. Up to World War I, Sillian was a garrison town of the Austro-Hungarian Army. By the 1919 Treaty of Saint Germain, it became a border town close to the South Tyrolean lands of the Italian kingdom. Young Richard Strauss from 1872 onwards spent several summers at Sillian; he is purported to have played the church organ as well as the hotel piano of the Schwarzer Adler (Black Eagle) inn, and even to have composed here. Sillian's economy mainly relies on wood processing and tourism. There are 1200 guest beds of all categories available. This Tyrol location article is a stub.

"Robert William 'Robbie' Maddison (born 14 July 1981) is an Australian motorbike stunt performer. Nicknamed 'Maddo', he is from the town of Kiama, New South Wales. Born in Caringbah, Maddison grew up in Kiama Downs, and developed his passion for riding by competing in national motocross and supercross events. He completed Year 10 at Kiama High School and took up an electrical apprenticeship. Maddison continued learning freestyle motocross (FMX) tricks and after becoming proficient in the skills he entered his first amateur event, and won both the amateur and professional events at Bacchus Marsh, Victoria. In early 2004 Maddison won Gold at the X Games held at Australia's Wonderland after completing 13 back flips. In May 2005, the Crusty Demons motorcycle stunt group gave Maddison the opportunity to break two world records on his motorbike: After this Maddison went on to win numerous international FMX events around the world and has been recognized as one of the best FMX riders of all time. Maddo's motto: ""Face your fears - live your dreams"" On 31 December 2007, (on the 40th anniversary of Evel Knievel jumping the fountains at Caesars Palace), and live on the ESPN cable TV network, Maddison broke the World motorcycle jumping record, travelling 98.34m on a motorbike. He repeated the event immediately afterward, successfully landing the jump, as his fiancée Amy looked on. His second attempt, however, did not go as far as the first jump; he was not injured in either jump. On 29 March 2008, Maddison broke his own world record twice during the Crusty Demons Night of World Records show in Melbourne, Australia. During his first jump he travelled 316 feet (96.32m) and landed on the safety zone nearly hitting the front of the landing ramp. On his second attempt Maddison broke the world record by travelling 342feet 7inches (104.42m). This time he landed hard on his back tyre and was not satisfied by the jump, so he decided to jump once more. On his third jump he again broke the world record, this time with 106.98m (350.98feet) into a perfect landing. On 1 January 2009, live on ESPN, Maddison and his Yamaha YZ 250 motorbike successfully jumped 96 feet (29m) up onto the Arc de Triomphe in front of Paris Las Vegas and then descended an 80-foot (24m) drop off the monument safely to ground level. Maddison said after the jump that he may have broken his hand and had a gash to the bone in the webbing of his left hand. On 30 May 2009, Maddison indicated he was more than just a stuntman by defeating the world's best freestyle riders at the Calgary, AB, Canada stop of the Red Bull X-Fighters competition. His victory in the Head-to-Head competition meant he had to progress through three rounds, defeating multiple X Games medallist Nate Adams (USA) in the first, defending series champion Mat Rebeaud (SUI) in the semi-final round and then 30-year-old series veteran Eigo Sato (JPN) in the final. On 13 July 2009, Maddison jumped Tower Bridge in London, with a backflip, whilst the drawbridge was open by 25 feet. The following weekend Maddison went on to the Red Bull X-Fighters championship in Madrid, winning the best trick contest with a brand new trick, an 'under flip one hander to side saddle lander'. In March 2010, Maddison become the first person to jump the start gantry at the Formula One in Melbourne, Australia. On 7 April 2010, Maddison performed a motocross jump over the Corinth Canal in Greece. That made him the first FMX rider who accomplished to cross over the canal on his motorbike. He took off with a speed of 120kmh and jumped over more than 80m. About the jump, Maddison said: ""Jumping across the Corinth Canal became a challenge I just could not resist. This jump involved the highest consequences I have faced so far. I believe that sometimes you have to take risks in life to become wiser and facing a challenge like this will help get me ready for the next aim I will face in the future. I am thrilled about managing to pull it off, as you know there is only one opportunity to get it right!"" On 31 December 2011 Maddison attempted to jump 400 feet across San Diego Bay as part of Red Bull New Year No Limits, in a tandem jump with American snowmobile racer Levi LaVallee. After landing over 391ft in practice, he landed shy of the 400 feet goal on the night due to the fog, damp conditions and reduced traction, landing 378ft, 9 inches. Maddison went to Istanbul early in 2012 to be the motorbike stunt double for James Bond actor Daniel Craig in the Bond movie Skyfall. He went on to receive a Screen Actors Guild Award for best stunt ensemble for Skyfall. In 2013 he went on to win the Taurus World Stunt Awards for ""best stunt with a vehicle."" In April 2015 Maddison successfully rode a modified dirt motorbike on a wave near Teahupoo in Tahiti, after two years of preparation for the event. In 2016, Maddison developed a special edition snow bike in cooperation with YETI SnowMX, the 2017 'Special Edition Robbie Maddison YETI SnowMX snowbike'. In 2017, Maddison appeared in the movie XXX: Return of Xander Cage, performing as a stunt double for actor Vin Diesel as he rode a motorbike on the ocean. On 4 February 2017, Maddison claimed on his Facebook page that, ""I set a new world record yesterday on distance ridden on the water"", showing photos of his distance of 19.8 miles in a time of 31.29 at a top speed of 45mph happening on 3 February 2017.

"Information history may refer to the history of each of the categories listed below (or to combinations of them). It should be recognized that the understanding of, for example, libraries as information systems only goes back to about 1950. The application of the term information for earlier systems or societies is a retronym. The Latin roots and Greek origins of the word ""information"" is presented by Capurro & Hjørland (2003). References on ""formation or molding of the mind or character, training, instruction, teaching"" date from the 14th century in both English (according to Oxford English Dictionary) and other European languages. In the transition from Middle Ages to Modernity the use of the concept of information reflected a fundamental turn in epistemological basis – from ""giving a (substantial) form to matter"" to ""communicating something to someone"". Peters (1988, pp.12–13) concludes: In the modern era, the most important influence on the concept of information is derived from the Information theory developed by Claude Shannon and others. This theory, however, reflects a fundamental contradiction. Northrup (1993) wrote: In their seminal book The Study of Information: Interdisciplinary Messages, Almach and Mansfield (1983) collected key views on the interdisciplinary controversy in computer science, artificial intelligence, library and information science, linguistics, psychology, and physics, as well as in the social sciences. Almach (1983, p.660) himself disagrees with the use of the concept of information in the context of signal transmission, the basic senses of information in his view all referring ""to telling something or to the something that is being told. Information is addressed to human minds and is received by human minds."" All other senses, including its use with regard to nonhuman organisms as well to society as a whole, are, according to Machlup, metaphoric and, as in the case of cybernetics, anthropomorphic. Hjørland (2007)  describes the fundamental difference between objective and subjective views of information and argues that the subjective view has been supported by, among others, Bate son, Yovits, Span-Hansen, Brier, Buck land, Goguen, and Hjørland. Hjørland provided the following example: Information history is an emerging discipline related to, but broader than, library history. An important introduction and review was made by Alistair Black (2006). A prolific scholar in this field is also Toni Weller, for example, Weller (2007, 2008, 2010a and 2010b). As part of her work Toni Weller has argued that there are important links between the modern information age and its historical precedents. A description from Russia is Volodin (2000). Alistair Black (2006, p.445) wrote: ""This chapter explores issues of discipline definition and legitimacy by segmenting information history into its various components: ""Bodies influential in the field include the American Library Association’s Round Table on Library History, the Library History Section of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), and, in the U.K., the Library and Information History Group of the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP). Each of these bodies has been busy in recent years, running conferences and seminars, and initiating scholarly projects. Active library history groups function in many other countries, including Germany (The Wolfenbuttel Round Table on Library History, the History of the Book and the History of Media, located at the Herzog August Bibliothek), Denmark (The Danish Society for Library History, located at the Royal School of Library and Information Science), Finland (The Library History Research Group, University of Tamepere), and Norway (The Norwegian Society for Book and Library History). Sweden has no official group dedicated to the subject, but interest is generated by the existence of a museum of librarianship in Bods, established by the Library Museum Society and directed by Magnus Torstensson. Activity in Argentina, where, as in Europe and the U.S., a ""new library history"" has developed, is described by Parada (2004)."" (Black (2006, p. 447). The term IT is ambiguous although mostly synonym with computer technology. Haigh (2011, pp. 432-433) wrote Some people use the term information technology about technologies used before the development of the computer. This is however to use the term as a retronym. ""It is said that we live in an ""Age of Information,"" but it is an open scandal that there is no theory, nor even definition, of information that is both broad and precise enough to make such an assertion meaningful."" (Goguen, 1997). The Danish Internet researcher Niels Ole Finnemann (2001) developed a general history of media. He wrote: ""A society cannot exist in which the production and exchange of information are of only minor significance. For this reason one cannot compare industrial societies to information societies in any consistent way. Industrial societies are necessarily also information societies, and information societies may also be industrial societies."" He suggested the following media matrix: Many information science historians cite Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine as the fathers of information science with the founding of the International Institute of Bibliography (IIB) in 1895 Institutionally, information science emerged in the last part of the 19th century as documentation science which in general shifted name to information science in the 1960s. Heting Chu (2010) classified the history and development of information representation and retrieval (IRR) in four phases. ""The history of IRR is not long. A retrospective look at the field identifies increased demand, rapid growth, the demystification phase, and the networked era as the four major stages IRR has experienced in its development:"" ",Normal

"Sacred Heart High School was a co-educational four-year Catholic high school in Vineland, New Jersey, United States, operating under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Camden. The school had been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools since 1963. As of the 2009–10 school year, the school had an enrollment of 288 students and 23.8 faculty (on an FTE basis), resulting in a student–teacher ratio of 12.1:1.

In the spring of that year the school, designed to accommodate an enrollment of 350, had 67 twelfth graders and a total of 202 students. On April 12, 2013, it was announced that Sacred Heart High School would close at the end of the school year, on June 30. This announcement was made with no prior warning by Bishop Dennis J.

"Milan Milutinović (Serbian Cyrillic: Милан Милутиновић; 19 December 1942 – 2 July 2023) was a Serbian politician who served as the president of Serbia from 1997 to 2002. Milutinović served as Secretary for Education and Science of Serbia (1977–1982), Director of the National Library of Serbia (1983–1987), Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to Greece (1989–1995), Yugoslavia's Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs (1995–1997). After his presidential term expired in December 2002, he surrendered to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia where he was tried for war crimes. He was found not guilty on all charges on 26 February 2009. Milan Milutinović came from an old Belgrade family. He was born in Belgrade to Aleksandar, a civil engineer, and Ljubica (née Jokić), an art historian. He attended school in Belgrade and graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law and obtained an LL.M in 1965. From 1969 to 1971, he was a Member of the Presidency of the Yugoslav Socialist Youth Union, and, from 1974 to 1977 Secretary for Ideology of the City Committee of the League of Communists of Belgrade. Milutinović was a Member of the Federal Parliament of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1969 to 1974, during which time he served, inter alia, on the Foreign Affairs Committee. From 1977 to 1982, Milutinović was the Secretary for Education, Science and Sport of the Socialist Republic of Serbia. During his term, he worked on a comprehensive reform of the education system. His comparative research on higher education systems in Europe was published in his book, University-Eppur si Muove: University Reform-between Tradition and the Future (Belgrade, 1985). Following his term as Secretary for Education, Milan Milutinović was elected Director of the National Library of Serbia following a public competition, a position that he held until 1987. In 1987, during the term of Federal Secretary Raif Dizdarević, Milan Milutinović joined the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Affairs of the SFRY, as Ambassador and Head of Sector for Press, Information and Culture. In September 1989, Milutinović was appointed Ambassador of the SFRY to Greece. During much of his term as Ambassador to Greece (between 1992 and 1995), Milutinović was Yugoslavia's only Ambassador to a Western state, as, due to the UN embargo imposed in May 1992, new ambassadors could not be appointed, while Milutinović was never withdrawn by Belgrade. In August 1995, Milutinović was appointed Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In November 1995, he was one of the leading negotiators during the Bosnia peace negotiations in Dayton, Ohio and one of the draftsmen of what subsequently became the Dayton Peace Accords, which led to the permanent cessation of hostilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. During his term as Foreign Minister, he also signed several agreements between Yugoslavia and its neighbour Croatia aimed at normalizing relations between the two countries. After Slobodan Milošević's second, the last constitutionally allowable, mandate as the President of Serbia, he was controversially elected the president of Yugoslavia. Milošević's Socialist Party of Serbia still wanted to retain the Serbian presidency, and their first candidate in the Serbian presidential elections in 1997 was Zoran Lilić. The first two rounds of elections failed as the necessary majority (under the 1990 Constitution) of population failed to vote. A coalition of Socialist Party of Serbia, Yugoslav Left and New Democracy decided to change their candidate for the repeated elections, as the leader of the nationalist Serbian Radical Party Vojislav Šešelj won the plurality against Lilić. Many of the opposition parties, led by the Democratic Party, boycotted the 1997 elections as they expected results manipulation. Milutinović, a member of Socialist Party of Serbia, was the party's choice after Lilić's failure. In the second round of elections, held in December 1997, he won 2,177,462 votes or 59.18% by official count, while 50.96% voters turned out. Vojislav Šešelj, who got 1,383,781 votes or 37.61%, boycotted Milutinović's inauguration ceremony. As Milošević became the President of the Yugoslav Federation, political power shifted to the federal level along with him, and Milutinović de facto enjoyed little political influence. However, Milutinović was the leader of the Yugoslavian government's negotiation group in the Rambouillet Agreement in 1999, a prelude to the NATO campaign against Yugoslavia. He still acted under Milošević's directives. After Milošević and his party were ousted in October 2000 and their political power marginalized on federal, republic and most local levels, Milutinović still remained in office, as his term did not end until 2002. His powers as the president were trivialized from 2000 to 2002, since his political affiliation did not enjoy popular support and he could not be backed up by any other government branch. Milutinović was out of the eye of public performing only the most basic constitutional obligations without any opposition to the Democratic Opposition of Serbia coalition. In 2002, when his mandate expired, the presidential elections were held in which Milutinović did not run. He was succeeded by an acting president Nataša Mićić. During the transition to democracy in late 2000, Milutinović refused to support a violent suppression of the October Demonstrations in Belgrade. The smooth relations between him and the new government, while in office, incurred the dislike of Milošević's closest allies, although there had never been an official rupture. At the same time, Milutinović did not enjoy the support of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, as he in turn was considered, by most of its members, as a close ally of Milošević. Upon the expiry of his term in office, Milutinović turned himself into International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 2003. He was tried under joint war crimes indictment along with Nikola Šainović and Dragoljub Ojdanić. Milutinović was prosecuted on four counts: deportation, murder as a crime against humanity, murder as violation of laws or customs of war, and ""other inhumane acts"" during the War in Kosovo. The allegations include responsibility for mass murders at Račak, Bela Crkva, Mala Kruša and Velika Kruša, Đakovica, Padalište, Izbica, Dubadeva, Mbrca, Vucitrn, Meja, Dubrava, Suva Reka and Kačanik, during 1999. According to the indictment, Milutinović had personal responsibility as the President of Serbia, with power over various governmental institutions. He was a member of the Yugoslavian Supreme Defense Council, thus making decisions in regard to the Yugoslavian Army. He also had a power to dissolve the Serbian Parliament. According to the indictment, during wartime his de jure powers were extended to ones belonging to the Parliament during peacetime, including control of the police, subordinate to the Army at the time. This claim was hotly contested by Milutinović's defense counsel and some constitutional lawyers, as the 1990 Constitution was written in view of Serbia possibly becoming a sovereign, unitary state, due to the impending collapse of Tito's Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (which finally occurred in mid-1991). In reality, Serbia was not sovereign, as it still formed part of Milošević's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, whose President (Milošević) held the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces. In addition, according to the defense, the Supreme Defense Council was not exercising operational control over Yugoslav troops, neither de jure nor de facto. The ICTY Prosecution also claimed that Milutinović, as the President of Serbia, had de facto influence over the Parliament, the Army and the police (Ministry of Internal Affairs). On 26 February 2009, Milutinović was acquitted on charges of war crimes. Finding Milutinović not guilty on all counts of the indictment, the court ruled that Milutinović had ""no direct control over the Yugoslav army"". Judge Iain Bonomy blamed Slobodan Milošević for the alleged crimes, and said that Milutinović was ""not a key player in the ruling political party."" Milan Milutinović was married to Olga Milutinović (née Spasojević) from 6 December 1970 until her death, on 20 January 2017. They have one son, Veljko (born 1979). After his acquittal before the ICTY in 2009, Milutinović returned to live in Belgrade. Milutinović died on 2 July 2023, at the age of 80.",Normal
"The Razi dialect was a northwestern Iranian language spoken in the city of Ray, located on the southern slopes of the Alborz mountain range situated near Tehran, the capital of Iran. It was most likely a continuation of the Median language. The language was seemingly very similar to the Parthian language. The only surviving text written in Razi is by Bundar Razi (died 101011), a Shi'ite poet who was part of the court of Majd al-Dawla (r. 997–1029), the amir (ruler) of the Buyid branch of Ray. As Ray was located in the historical region of Media, its local language in the pre-Islamic era, according to the modern historian Hassan Rezai Baghbidi, must have been Median. The oldest surviving source that refers to the Razi dialect is a book that the Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi (died 991) wrote in the 10th-century; The people of Ray change their names, instead of ʿAlī, Ḥasan and Aḥmad, they say ʿlkʾ Alkā, ḥskʾ Haskā, ḥmkʾ Hamkā … in Ray they use rā, they say rʾdh rā-dah “give!”, rʾkn rā-kun “do!” … among the languages of the aʿājim (i. e. the Iranian people) there is no language more attractive than that of the people of Ray. Some of the words used in the Tehrani dialect may derive from Razi, such as sūsk ""beetle; cockroach"", jīrjīrak ""cricket"", zālzālak ""haw(thorn)"", and vejīn ""weeding"".",Normal
"Boodle is a collection of short stories by Leslie Charteris, first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder and Stoughton in August 1934. This was the thirteenth book to feature the adventures of Simon Templar, alias ""The Saint"", and the second short story collection featuring the character. The title is taken from the British slang term ""boodle"" meaning bribery, stolen goods or loot (it is also a term frequently used by Templar). When first published in the United States by The Crime Club, the unfamiliar-sounding title was changed to The Saint Intervenes, and this title was later applied to future UK editions. As with the earlier collection, The Brighter Buccaneer, Boodle consists of stories written by Charteris under contract with the UK magazine Empire News during 1933. One story, ""The Man Who Liked Toys"", was first published in The American Magazine as a non-Saint story featuring a lead character named Kestry; Charteris later revised the story to include the Saint. Three stories, ""The Noble Sportsman"", ""The Art Photographer"", and ""The Mixture as Before"" received their first publication in Boodle. The book consists of between 12 and 14 stories, depending upon the edition: For reasons unknown, later British editions of this collection omit either one or both of the two stories ""The Uncritical Publisher"" and ""The Noble Sportsman"". ""The Uncritical Publisher"" has been released by the Saint Club and as a DVD extra. Most of the stories, save for three - noted as applicable - were first published in the UK newspaper Empire News, and most were retitled for omnibus publication (alternate titles listed where applicable). The Empire stories are collected in the order of first publication: ""The Noble Sportsman"" was adapted for the TV series The Saint during its second season, first airing on 9 January 1964. (The story itself was one of two that was not included in British editions of the book.) Three stories were adapted for the programme's third season: ""The Loving Brothers"" (19 November 1964), ""The Man Who Liked Toys"" (26 November 1964), and ""The Damsel in Distress"" (31 December 1964).

"""Women's Appreciation"" is the twenty-second episode of the third season of the American version of The Office, the show's fiftieth overall, and the third supersized episode of the season. In this episode, Phyllis is flashed in the parking lot, so Michael takes all the women to the mall for ""women's appreciation"", where the status of his relationship with Jan comes to light. Meanwhile, Pam makes a sketch supposedly of the man who flashed Phyllis, when it in fact resembles Dwight, who is unaware and posts the fliers throughout town. The episode was written by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg and directed by Tucker Gates. The characters travel to Mall at Steamtown, a shopping center in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Cast members Jenna Fischer and Kate Flannery enjoyed the three-day shoot outside the office, and the latter was able to perform her own driving stunts. While filming, the cast were often met with fans ""in full force"" yelling out Steve Carell's name and taking pictures. Retailer Victoria's Secret agreed to close their mall store to the public to allow for episode filming. ""Women's Appreciation"" first aired in the United States on May 3, 2007. It garnered an estimated 7.0 million viewers, causing it to rank fourth in its timeslot. Television critics gave positive reviews to the episode. Comedic elements, such as Pam's prank on Dwight, were praised, and many critics found Michael's antics humorous, but one reviewer felt that Michael's relationship problems with Jan came out of nowhere. Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) enters the office and says she was flashed in the parking lot prompting Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to open an investigation. He orders Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to interview Phyllis and make a sketch of the flasher. However, Phyllis says she didn't get a good look at him, so Pam instead draws a picture of Dwight with a mustache and without glasses. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) (who also seems to notice that the sketch looks similar to Dwight) assists an oblivious Dwight in posting fliers with Pam's sketch on it around town. Michael Scott (Steve Carell) initially makes light of the exposure incident. After being shamed by how offended the other employees are by his antics, he attempts to reassert his sensitivity to women by holding a seminar on women's issues. He closes the meeting by offering to take the women to the Mall at Steamtown. Before leaving, he receives a call from Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), who asks to meet with him to have sex. Michael balks at the proposal, and becomes more uncomfortable when she offers to pay him for the sex. At the mall, Michael opens to the women about his discomfort with Jan. Among other things, he tells them Jan has been videotaping them having sex and watching it with him afterwards. All the women assure Michael that Jan's behavior is not normal and urge him to get out of the relationship. He remains conflicted about what he should do about Jan, but at Phyllis's prompting he finally admits to himself that he wants to break up with her. Michael thanks them for their help by treating them to one item each at Victoria's Secret. On the drive back, Pam takes a step toward asserting herself by changing a flat tire on Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) car. At the office, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) sneaks into the women's bathroom and discovers a plush waiting room. The other men soon join him. They leave in shock when Creed Bratton enters and is shown to regularly use the women's room ""to do number two"" (Noting to the camera that he has been ""caught several times"" and has ""paid dearly""). Upon returning to the office, Michael calls Jan to end their relationship, doing so by leaving a voicemail message when she fails to answer. As he is doing this, Jan walks into his office to apologize in person for their earlier conversation, but when she receives Michael's voicemail, she walks out in silence. The episode ends with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) informing Dwight he saw the flasher two minutes before in the women's bathroom ""above the sink"". Dwight dashes to the bathroom and examines the mirror where someone had etched a mustache similar to the sketch's. Dwight realizes the prank and curses Pam. ""Women's Appreciation"" was written by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, while Tucker Gates served as the episode's director. The cold open featuring Jim receiving a demerit from Dwight was initially intended for ""Business School"", and the opening of ""Product Recall"", which featured Jim and Dwight impersonating each other, was first intended for this episode before it was moved because of time constraints. Michael's talking head scene about Jan's safeword was meant to serve as a ""place holder"" until a better version could be shot, but was left in the episode because the writers forgot about it. While the characters travel to Mall at Steamtown, a shopping center in Scranton, Pennsylvania, episode filming actually took place near Los Angeles, where the series is normally shot. Kate Flannery, who plays Meredith, called the episode one of her favorites to shoot because she ""was stuck in a van with Mindy Kaling, Jenna Fischer, Angela Kinsey, Rashida Jones, Phyllis Smith and Steve Carell for two days"". Fischer agreed, calling it a ""fun episode to shoot"" due to having three days of filming with Carell and The Office women. Believing Meredith's minivan was ""another character"" in the series, Flannery enjoyed being able to drive and act simultaneously. In a reflection of the character's personality, the production crew added props such as bottles of alcohol, chips, crushed soda cans, garbage, and 14 air fresheners to the vehicle. The cast however soon developed headaches, leading to the air fresheners' removal. Flannery was able to perform her own stunts for the episode, explaining that she ""was nervous at first, but I think I really could be a demolition-derby star"". The cast enjoyed shooting at the mall, but were faced with fans ""in full force"". Crowds followed them while shooting, holding up camera phones and yelling Carell's name. Flannery said of the episode, ""We shot some really fun stuff with Steve and the ladies just running around the mall. The food-court scene was so much fun. Steve is an amazing actor."" Lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret agreed to close their store to the public for filming. In the episode, Angela reveals that she wears large sizes of clothes purchased from American Girl, a doll store chain, but will not shop at children's retailer Gap Kids because it is ""too flashy."" In the DVD audio commentary, Kinsey remarked that after the episode broadcast, people would bring up American Girl Doll catalogs for her to sign. Passersby also yelled out Carell's name during the scene where Pam changes a tire. The Season Three DVD contains a number of deleted scenes. Notable cut scenes include Kelly learning that Phyllis got flashed, Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration, calming down Phyllis, Andy trying to earn back Dwight's favor by bonding over cold soups, Michael imagining himself as a woman, Dwight escorting the women to Meredith's car, Michael choosing lingerie for Pam, and an alternate version of Michael's concluding talking head. The episode first broadcast in the United States on May 3, 2007, on NBC in a special timeslot, airing behind an episode of My Name Is Earl. ""Women's Appreciation"" was a ""supersized"" episode, as it aired for forty minutes. It attracted an estimated 7.0 million viewers, and ranked fourth in its timeslot, behind episodes of Survivor: Fiji, Ugly Betty, and Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?. The episode received positive reviews from television critics. IGN writer Brian Zoromski called ""Women's Appreciation"" a ""fairly solid episode worthy of the super-sized treatment,"" and rated it 7.9 out of 10. He highlighted Pam's prank as well as Michael's attempt to break up with Jan via voicemail, calling the latter ""easily the funniest moment in the episode, and perfectly played by both Steve Carell and Melora Hardin."" Zoromski did however criticize the series for abandoning plot points, such as the publicity fiasco from the previous episode. Give Me My Remote's Kath Skerry called it a ""hilarious episode,"" and observed ""I don’t think The Office has ever pushed the envelope in terms of sexual discussion as much as it did tonight."" Jay Black from AOL TV disliked the episode's awkward moments and thought Michael's unhappiness with Jan came out of nowhere. Black did however praise Pam's prank as well as Dwight himself, but concluded his review: ""A surprisingly weak handling of character combined with fewer laugh-out-loud moments than I'm used to forces me to give this episode 4 Creed number-twos out of 7."" Entertainment Weekly staff writer Abby West also critiqued ""Women's Appreciation"", explaining that it ""felt exactly like a 30-minute episode stretched to fill 43 minutes"". She thought the episode ""only came together"" once the Office women performed an intervention for Michael.",Normal

"The blanket protest was part of a five-year protest during the Troubles by Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners held in the Maze prison (also known as ""Long Kesh"") in Northern Ireland. The republican prisoners' status as political prisoners, known as Special Category Status, had begun to be phased out in 1976. Among other things, this meant that they would now be required to wear prison uniforms like ordinary convicts. The prisoners refused to accept the administrative designation of ordinary criminals, and refused to wear the prison uniform. In 1917 a form of blanket protest was carried out by a single Irish Republican internee Padraic Fleming in Maryborough (now Portlaoise Prison). Fleming was refused treatment as a political prisoner and went on hunger strike. There was considerable public outrage over the earlier death (by forced feeding) of Thomas Ashe and Fleming was released in November 1917. Fleming was rearrested in May 1918 and refused to wear prison uniforms which resulted in him being left naked and locked in his cell and (because he destroyed his cell) was restrained with a straight jacket. Fleming went on several long hunger strikes and finally was granted political prisoner status and transferred to Mountjoy Prison. Fleming escaped the prison with 19 others on 29 March 1919. In 1920 several hunger strikes (Mountjoy and Cork) were conducted by Irish Republicans demanding political status, resulting in two deaths from starvation. In the 1923 Irish hunger strikes thousands of Irish prisoners went on hunger strikes resulting in several deaths. In mid June 1943 a form of blanket protest was carried out by Irish Republican prisoners in Crumlin Road Jail when 22 prisoners went on a ""strip strike' for political status. Each morning every article (except a towel) was removed from each cell and the prisoners were left to sit on the floor until night time when the bedding was returned. IRA man Seán McCaughey died on hunger strike (11 May 1946) in Portlaoise Prison. McCaughey was demanding political status, refusing to wear prison clothes and was kept naked (except for a blanket) in solitary confinement for nearly five years. During the 20th century a total of 22 Irish Republicans died on hunger strike while demanding political status - see Groups who have conducted hunger strikes in List of hunger strikes. Convicted paramilitary prisoners were treated as ordinary criminals until July 1972, when Special Category Status was introduced following a hunger strike by 40 IRA prisoners led by the veteran republican Billy McKee. Special Category, or political, status meant prisoners were treated very much like prisoners of war; for example, they did not have to wear prison uniforms or do prison work.: 13–16 In 1976, as part of the policy of ""criminalisation"", the British Government brought an end to Special Category Status for paramilitary prisoners in Northern Ireland. The policy was not introduced for existing prisoners, but for those convicted after 1 March 1976. The end to Special Category Status was a serious threat to the authority which the paramilitary leaderships inside prison had been able to exercise over their own men, as well as being a propaganda blow.: 13–16 The imminent withdrawal of Special Category Status caused relations between the prisoners and prison officers to deteriorate, and in early 1976 the IRA leaders in prison sent word to the IRA Army Council asking them to begin assassinating prison officers, stating ""we are prepared to die for political status. Those who try to take it away from us must be fully prepared to pay the same price"".: 350 Outside the prison the IRA responded by shooting prison officer Patrick Dillon in April 1976, the first of nineteen prison officers to be killed during the five-year protest.: 351 The blanket protest began on 14 September 1976 when newly convicted prisoner Kieran Nugent refused to wear prison uniform. Nugent had previously been interned in the compounds of Long Kesh during 1975, but was arrested in May 1976 and received a three-year sentence after being convicted of possessing weapons and hijacking a car.: 349 In 1985, Nugent gave an interview describing his arrival at the newly constructed H-Blocks at the prison complex: I was brought straight to the blocks. Cell 17, D wing H1 or 2. I was stripped and beaten. The screws who knew me said, 'We are the bosses now. There are no OCs here'. A screw said to me, 'What size are you in the waist and what size are you for shoes?' I asked him 'What for?' and he told me 'For a uniform'. I said, 'You have got to be joking'. I was the only one in the H-Blocks. They dragged me into the cell. Davy Long  wanted me to compromise. He suggested I wore my own shoes and trousers if I wore a prison shirt. I just laughed. He locked the door. I lay on the floor all night without mattress, blankets or anything else. The heat was reasonable in all fairness and I slept.: 349–50 Nugent was given a blanket on the second day of his imprisonment, which he wore during an exercise period.: 349–50 Nugent only wore a prison uniform once, when his mother visited the prison. He told her: You will not be seeing me for three years because to have a visit I have to wear uniform. If they want me to wear a uniform they'll have to nail it to my back.: 349–50 Other newly convicted prisoners joined the protest, and at first they were allowed to wear blankets during the exercise period but eventually they were ordered to leave the blankets in their cells.: 349–50 As prison rules required the prisoners to wear prison uniform when leaving their cells, they were confined to their cells for twenty-four hours a day.: 13–16 The prison governor would order the protesting prisoners to wear uniforms every two weeks, and the prisoners refused.: 349–50 As a result of their refusal, they would receive three days ""on the boards"" where all furniture was removed from their cell, and they were served the ""number one diet"" consisting of tea without milk, watery soup and dry bread.: 349–50 The refusal to comply with prison rules carried a further punishment, the loss of remission which reduced a prisoner's sentence by fifty percent in exchange for good behaviour.: 13–16 Prisoners were entitled to four visits from friends or family each month, three were in exchange for good behaviour and the fourth was statutory. Protesting prisoners automatically forfeited the three ""privileged"" visits, and their refusal to wear prison uniform even for visits meant they forfeited the fourth.: 13–16 This left one censored letter in and out of the prison each month as their only contact with the outside world, until after several months some prisoners compromised by agreeing to wear uniforms for visits to maintain contact with the paramilitary leaderships outside the prison.: 17 As a result of the IRA's assassination campaign against prison officers, relations between the prisoners and prison officers were tense. In March 1978 some prisoners refused to leave their cells to shower or use the lavatory because of attacks by prison officers, and were provided with wash-hand basins in their cells.: 351 The prisoners requested showers be installed in their cells and when this request was turned down they refused to use the wash-hand basins.: 351 At the end of April 1978 a fight occurred between a prisoner and a prison officer in H-Block 6. The prisoner was taken away to solitary confinement, and news spread across the wing that the prisoner had been badly beaten.: 351 The prisoners responded by smashing the furniture in their cells, and the prison authorities responded by removing the remaining furniture from the cells leaving the prisoners in cells with just blankets and mattresses.: 351 The prisoners responded by refusing to leave their cells, and as a result the prison officers were unable to clear them. This resulted in the blanket protest escalating into the dirty protest, as the prisoners were unable to ""slop out"" (i.e., empty their chamber pots) so resorted to smearing excrement on the walls of their cells.: 351–52 On 27 October 1980, IRA members Brendan Hughes, Tommy McKearney, Raymond McCartney, Tom McFeeley, Sean McKenna, Leo Green, and INLA member John Nixon, began a hunger strike aimed at restoring political status for paramilitary prisoners by securing what were known as the ""Five Demands"": After a 53-day hunger strike with McKenna lapsing in and out of a coma and on the brink of death, the government appeared to concede the essence of the prisoners' five demands with a 30-page document detailing a proposed settlement. With the document in transit to Belfast, Hughes took the decision to save McKenna's life and end the strike after 53 days on 18 December. In January 1981 it became clear that the prisoners' demands had not been conceded. On 4 February the prisoners issued a statement saying that the British government had failed to resolve the crisis and declared their intention of ""hunger striking once more"". The 1981 Irish hunger strike began on 1 March when Bobby Sands refused food, and by the time the strike ended on 3 October, ten men, including Sands, had starved to death. Two days later, the incoming Northern Ireland Secretary, James Prior, announced a number of changes in prison policy, including that from then on all paramilitary prisoners would be allowed to wear their own clothes at all times.: 375",Normal
"Reliant Motor Company was a British car manufacturer based in Tamworth, Staffordshire, England. It was founded in 1935 and ended car production in 2002, the company had been known as ""Reliant Motor Company"" (or RMC for short) until the 1990s when it became ""Reliant Motors"" and then finally became ""Reliant Cars LTD"" after production had ended of the Robin as the company was restructured to be a car import business. It is now a dormant company and the only entity left is a separate parts company created called ""Reliant Partsworld"" which produces parts for Reliant vehicles. Reliant was a large manufacturing company that mainly produced vehicles for niche markets, such as small three-wheeled vehicles and sports cars. It was best known for the three-wheeled Reliant Robin, but produced a variety of vehicles over 60 years, including sports cars, convertibles and commercial vehicles. Approximately half a million Reliant vehicles were produced and sold in at least nine countries. For a period from the 1970s until the 1990s, Reliant was the UK's second biggest British-owned car manufacturer behind British Leyland. To make their vehicles light, the company decided to produce car bodies from fibreglass in the mid-1950s. From this, Reliant became a pioneer in fibreglass design, techniques, and developments. Reliant also produced kitchen worktops, train bodies, and personal watercraft shells from fibreglass. In the 1970s, Reliant was the largest producer of fibreglass in Europe. Reliant became the second-largest British-owned car company in the 1970s after the forming of British Leyland, Reliant had five factories and sold vehicles to seven countries. When the Raleigh Bicycle Company decided to discontinue the manufacture of their three-wheeled vehicles in 1934, their works manager, T. L. Williams, and a colleague, E. S. Thompson, felt that the days of lightweight three-wheelers were not over. They decided to build their own vehicle in Williams's back garden on Kettlebrook Road in Tamworth. Their home-built design closely resembled the Karryall van previously built by Raleigh, and the prototype was licensed in January 1935. It was a 7 cwt (356kg) van with a steel chassis, powered by a 600 cc single-cylinder engine driving the rear wheels through a three-speed gearbox and chain drive. The body was a hardwood frame with aluminium panels attached to it, like other cars of the time. With the motorcycle front end, mounted in the open, in front of the bulkhead, it was essentially a motorcycle fitted with a box body. The initial prototype had handlebars for steering, but after several trials with small local companies, it was changed to a steering wheel. The work moved to a disused bus depot on Watling Street in Fazeley. On 3 June 1935, the first Reliant was delivered. Powered by a single-cylinder air-cooled 600 cc J.A.P. engine, the driver sat centrally on the vehicle astride the engine, much like a motorcyclist. The single-cylinder engine left the Reliant under-powered. In March 1936, a two-cylinder, water-cooled J.A.P. engine and an increase to 8 cwt (407kg) gross vehicle weight was released. The driver no longer sat astride the engine and the vehicle gained more conventional forward-facing seats in the front. The first improved eight cwt twin-cylinder model was delivered on 16 March 1936. In 1938, the Reliant Motor Company started to use the 7hp, 747 cc four-cylinder Austin side-valve engine as found in the popular Austin Seven. The first four-cylinder Reliant was delivered on 12 March 1938. The Austin Car Company then announced its intention to cease production of the 747 cc Austin Seven engine, as Williams was always enthusiastic about making Reliant as independent as possible. He was keen that the company did not buy parts that it could make ""in-house"". Austin sold all the 747 cc engine tooling and manufacturing rights to Reliant, allowing them to commence manufacturing the engine. Although appearing very similar to the Austin engine, the level of commonality between Reliant and Austin remains unclear; the Reliant side-valve engine was a 747 cc four-cylinder unit built using smaller-scale manufacturing techniques than Austin. The Reliant crankcase was sand-cast rather than die-cast. During the Second World War, Reliant machined parts for the war effort. In the post-war years, three-wheeler development continued. Reliant introduced a slightly modified van called the Regent. Visually similar to an over-sized motorcycle, the first Regent was completed on 13 March 1946, ten years after the first twin-cylinder van. The Regent grew to a GVW of 10 cwt and was better equipped, with sliding windows in the doors rather than canvas side screens. Two larger models were produced, a 12 cwt Regent and a Prince Regent. In 1953, the Regent continued to be built alongside the Reliant Regal. The Regent was eventually replaced by the Regal Mk II 5 cwt van in 1956. In 1952, a four-seat car was launched, initially with an aluminium body, but panel by panel, the company substituted it with fibreglass, as their understanding of the material improved and the price of aluminium increased. By 1956, the bodywork of the Mark 3 version of the Reliant Regal had changed completely to fibreglass. The first generation of vehicles were designated Mk1 to Mk6, with each one getting improvements and slightly different styling. The car was originally powered by the 750 cc Austin Seven engine, originally manufactured by Austin Motor Company and later Reliant. Reliant's redesign of the engine gave it 17.5hp (13.0kW), which was a big improvement over the 7hp of the original Austin design. Reliant was one of the last companies to produce a side-valve engine design, with the production of the Reliant 750 cc engine ending in 1962. The 1963 Regal 325 had its body completely made of fibreglass. On previous generations of the Regal, the body was fibreglass, but the floor was made of bolted-together hardwood. Its engine was the first mass-produced lightweight overhead valve aluminium-alloy engine in Europe and the UK. Displacement was initially 598 cc on the Regal 325, but was later upgraded to 700 cc on the Regal 330. At the same time, Reliant were working for other countries to design vehicles for home-grown production. Vehicles would be sent over in kit form for the countries' own workforces to assemble. Reliant would first design the vehicle to the country's or company's requirements. The first was the Anadol in Turkey, which was based on a mix of Ford parts and a custom chassis. The Anadol began as a two-door saloon, then a four-door saloon, followed by commercial pickup and van versions. The pickup was produced until the early 1990s. A similar vehicle was the Israeli Sabra Sport, also based on a Ford engine and running gear. Reliant was so impressed with the design, they sold it in the UK as the Sabre to help Reliant's company image expand beyond a three-wheeled micro-car maker. The car sold poorly against offerings from Triumph and MG, however. Later, Reliant bought a prototype design for the replacement Daimler Dart, which became the Scimitar coupe and later the best-selling sporting estate—the Scimitar GTE. To power the Scimitar GT coupe and Sabre, Reliant turned towards Ford of Britain and were supplied with the Zephyr 6 and Consul 4 engines. The coupe GT could be purchased with either the 2.5 litre or the 3.0 litre Essex V6 engine. Later, 3.0 GTEs were fitted with Essex V6 engines and gearboxes. On the 3.0 V6 GTE, the back axle ratio changed depending on the use of either a straight four-speed gearbox or one with an overdrive unit. Reliant bought out Bond Cars in 1969 after Bond had gone into liquidation. Reliant purchased Bond after wanting to enter Triumph dealerships. Bond's Equipe sports car already had this agreement, but Triumph entered British Leyland and the deal ended. It is said that Bond was Reliant's main competitor in three-wheeled vehicles, with the Bond Minicar and the Bond 875, but Reliant's vehicles outsold Bond's in huge numbers, with a much larger production and dealer network. Reliant did use the Bond name for the 1970s Bond Bug, which was a Reliant prototype originally named the Reliant Rogue. The Bug was a sporty three-wheeler designed by Ogle designer Tom Karen. The Bug used a shortened Reliant Regal chassis and other mechanical parts, but many parts, such as the front swingarm, were new designs that would also be used on the 1973 Reliant Robin. The Bond Bug came in 700, 700E and 700ES models until replaced by the 750 model. Reliant built four-wheeled versions of their three-wheeled stablemates – the first was the Reliant Rebel, which had three-quarters of the rear chassis design of the Regal, but front suspension based on the Triumph Herald with Reliant's own steering system. The engines were the same 600 cc and 700 cc units used in the Regal, but with a higher compression ratio and more torque because of the extra weight the Rebel carried over the Regal. The last model came with the 750 cc version when the Mk1 Reliant Robin was introduced. The styling of the Rebel was intended to make the car look unique so it did not seem like a four-wheeled version of the Regal; the Rebel came in saloon, estate and van models. The Reliant Kitten was the four-wheeled version of the 1970s Reliant Robin, designed to replace the Rebel and featuring the 850 cc version of Reliant's own engine, which was introduced in 1975 (with the Reliant Robin gaining the engine shortly afterwards). The design this time featured very heavily on the Reliant Robin with only the nose of the design being different, having square headlights and a black panel around them – this was done mainly for cost-saving reasons so the parts from both vehicles could be shared for production. After Reliant Kitten production stopped in 1982, the rights were sold to Sipani Automobiles in India who made the vehicle near-exactly the same, but with the name Sipani Dolphin. Later, the vehicle became a 4-door hatchback called the Sipani Montana. The car was built well into the 1990s with exactly the same Kitten mechanical. Reliant exported engines they had built for their own vehicles in the UK. Between 1983 and 1990, a utilitypickup vehicle called the Reliant Fox was produced in the UK. This was based on an original development by Reliant to design a vehicle for the Greek company MEBEA. It was based on Reliant Kitten mechanical with its own pickup body and canvas top design. It had originally been built in Greece by MEBEA between 1979 and 1983. After production finished in Greece, Reliant decided to build it in the UK, but gave the Fox many design changes, including 12-inch wheels, altered suspension and the high compression 850 cc engine. They designed a rear hardtop to make the vehicle into a van or estate. Tandy Industries used Foxes as a basis for a compact, two-berth camper-van. Reliant also made a small three-wheeled commercial vehicle called the Reliant TW9, later sold by other companies as the Ant (and, like the Robin, licence-built in Greece by MEBEA), which was a chassis and cab, onto which a custom rear body was fitted: a road sweeper, a flat back, a van, a milk float and hydraulic lifting rear bed version were common fitments. Also, a fifth wheel (actually fourth wheel) articulated tractor unit was created to pull large trailers. It was often used by public utility companies or more commonly sold to councils, where its ability to negotiate narrow alleyways was a big advantage. Reliant's expertise in the area of composite car body production also saw the company produce lightweight bodyshells for Ford RS200 rally cars and a fibreglass-bodied taxi, the MetroCab – the first to have full wheelchair provision (manufactured by a division of Kamkorp after 2001), they also made Ford fibreglass truck cabs and Ford Transit hightops. With Reliant's expertise in fibreglass. the company created bodies for trains, kitchen worktops and boatjet ski hulls. Reliant's main business was selling three-wheeled vehicles. The main market these would sell to would be a motorcyclist who didn't wish to pass their full car licence test. It was a sizable niche market due to the large number of motorcyclists present and it lasted until 2001 when the EU eliminated the B1 class from been issued with a full motorcycle licence (the B1 allowing the holder to drive a three or four-wheeled vehicle up to the weight of 550kg). The change capped Reliant's market share. The Hodge Group bought the majority of Reliant in 1962, selling it 15 years later to the Nash family. During the early 1990s, the owner of Reliant was a major housing developer and when the 1992 recession hit, the company folded and Reliant was sold to Beans Engineering. By 1996, Jonathan Haynes took the lead and his main backer took control – Haynes created a new range of Robin and Rialto specifications to appeal to more customers including more luxury models such as the SLX. Sales doubled as previously most Reliant vehicles were basic with not even the option of metallic paint. In 1997, production was relocated to Plant Lane, Burntwood, following a major redesign of the Robin model in 1998. The new model featured all new panels and was essentially a 'heavy facelift' designed by Andy Plumb. Research continued into four-wheeled Reliant models such as a Kitten for the modern age. Prototypes for this featured in many newspapers and magazines at the time. Production continued of the Robin model until 2001 when shareholders decided to import Ligier microcars and Piaggio Ape three-wheelers instead. Jonathan Haynes sold his shares and left the company before production ended because he wished to create an all-new four-wheeled Reliant model instead. The last Reliant made was the Robin 65 a Reliant Robin in metallic gold to celebrate 65 years of car production. The vehicles had every optional extra and sold for £10,000 - 65 of these vehicles were built up to Valentine's Day 2001. Reliant, in the early 1950s, agreed a deal in Israel to produce Regent vans in SKD form. Not long after this, Israel would ask Reliant for a four-wheeled vehicle design which could be built in Israel that was strong for their rough roads and could be used with a choice of van, pick up, and estate body styles. The car used a lot of Reliant's existing parts; basically converting a Regent into a four-wheeled vehicle. This vehicle would never be sold in the UK and called the Reliant Regent four 10 cwt van, this would be sold in Israel by Autocars limited but the vehicle renamed Sussita to make it seem a more homegrown car. In 1958 Reliant showed this vehicle extensively in the UK to demonstrate they could design more than just 3 wheeled vehicles but also only showed in LHD form as it was only an overseas model. Building on this relationship Autocars would then set Reliant the challenge to design a peoples' car for their country, this car would later be named the Carmel. The Carmel was designed around the same time Reliant were designing its Regal 325 and somehow some of its design features rubbed off, the square styling with a reverse slant Ford Anglia rear window for one, the engine was also the 1100cc Ford Anglia unit, apart from the body many of the chassis and running gear was used from the Sussita. Reliant would later design the Sabra Sport using Ashley Laminates existing kit car designs which Reliant would redesign again to sell it in the UK market as the Reliant Sabre. Reliant would continue designing vehicles for Autocars into the early 1970s when Autocars started to source parts from Standard-Triumph, severing ties with Reliant in the process. Autocars would end in the late 1970s and would plan to start a new company selling Reliant Kittens in Israel but this would not happen. From this export started another as in 1962 a Turkish delegation visited Autocars in Israel and was impressed with its car production; Turkey would later instruct Reliant to design its own peoples' car. Through this deal Reliant designed the Anadol, a saloon vehicle using a GRP body, separate chassis and Ford running gear, this deal though would not just be for a vehicle design but to help Turkey create its whole car production from its factory, paint and production. The company would be named Otosan. The Anadol would be designed into two-door saloon, four-door saloon, van, pick up and estate, several redesigns would keep the Anadol looking modern into the 1970s, later Otosan became more distant from Reliant as local content rose. Reliant offered in the 1980s again to redesign the Anadol even presenting a prototype but by this time Otosan believed it could go it alone and redesigned the vehicle itself, this wouldn't end well for Otosan with declining sales and eventually Otosan became a Ford assembly plant for Turkey producing the Ford Escort. Shortly after Reliant announced that production of the Robin would cease, production rights for the Reliant Robin were sold to a Sudbury-based firm called B&N Plastics, which redesigned major parts of the car. A deal was done where Reliant would supply the mechanical parts of the Reliant Robin to B&N Plastics and then the fibreglass skills of B&N Plastics would be used to build the vehicle and sell it under its own name. Production of the new Robin would begin in late 2001. The new car would be called the BN-1 Robin with no Reliant branding. The BN-2 model would be made with extras such as electric windows. The cost of the base model, the BN-1 Robin, was £10,000, but had all the features of the Robin 65, such as a leather interior. The BN-2 model had all these extras and more. However, after 30 to 40 cars were produced, Reliant could not supply the mechanical parts of the Reliant Robin as they had decided to end production of the Reliant 850 cc engine, which meant that the BN-1 Robin would need a redesign to use a different engine if production continued. B&N Plastics had already spent £100,000 on approving the Robin design so production could start. The company sought to find more investors to help fund further redesigns to keep the Robin alive but by early 2002, no investors were found and B&N Plastics ended its car production with over 200 orders unfulfilled. B&N Plastics ceased production in late 2002. In later years, it was revealed that B&N Plastics were planning to fit a Japanese K-car 660 cc three-cylinder engine and five-speed gearbox to make the Reliant Robin more modern. Reliant produced 50 vehicles a week until 2001, when it finished production of its own models to focus on importing French Ligier microcars and motorcycles as well as the Piaggio Ape range of commercial vehicles. A final version of the Reliant Robin was produced with leather seats, metallic gold paint, alloy wheels, walnut dashboard, and some other luxurious features, which retailed for £10,000. The car was made in the company's 65th year of production, and so was named the Reliant Robin 65. Reliant Cars Ltd. was renamed Reliant Partsworld, and operates from the factory where the Robin was built. The old site of Reliant Motors, in Tamworth, was turned into a housing estate named Scimitar Park, after the Reliant Scimitar that the company produced. A number of streets in the estate were named after Reliant models as well, such as 'Robin Close'. Since Reliant would be known for building robust fibreglass vehicles, it would diversify into producing fibreglass items other than their own vehicles. It was showcased in the ""World of Reliant"" documentary, which was written and filmed by Reliant in the early 1980s to show how diverse the company had become from a small car company producing three-wheeled vehicles. Other fibreglass products produced were items such as GRP sinks and kitchen worktops, GRP replacement car wings for metal vehicles, GRP guttering and tubes, GRP train carriage bodies for British rail, and GRP aircraft bodies. Reliant also had many contracts with Ford to build fibreglass high roof tops for their Transit model. Vauxhall Motors would also contract Reliant to make their GRP body kits for the Chevette. On 8 July 2017, a blue plaque was unveiled to honour both the founders, T. L. Williams and E. S. Thompson, and marked the birthplace of Reliant. The first Reliant prototype was built by Williams and Thompson in 1934, in the rear garden of Williams' residence, named Bro-Dawel, on Kettlebrook Road. The most widespread myth regarding Reliant vehicles is that they cannot go around corners. This was supposedly demonstrated on Top Gear, but Jeremy Clarkson admitted in The Sunday Times in 2016 that the Robin only rolled over frequently because the production team had welded the differential, fitted different sized rear wheels and placed heavy sandbags in the passenger footwell. As a result, the car became much less stable than before. Another myth is that a Reliant, or any three-wheeled vehicle, is not allowed on British motorways. This is not the case. Any two-, three- or four-wheeled vehicle is allowed on the motorway as long as its engine size is over 50cc (0.05L). It is a common misconception that the main character Derek ""Delboy"" Trotter in the British television comedy series Only Fools and Horses owned a Reliant Robin. Many people painted their Reliant Robins and Rialtos yellow with the famous ""Trotters’ Independent Trading Co"" lettering, but the Trotters' van was actually a Supervan III. Many people are under the impression Reliant three-wheeler can be driven on a Compulsory Basic Training (CBT) licence, but they have engines larger than the CBT licence allows. To drive a Reliant, a full motorcycle or car licence is required and the driver must be over 21. Another widely held myth was that all Reliant three-wheelers have no reverse gear; before 1964, the reverse gear would be disabled, but all Reliant vehicles were equipped with one. Originally, to drive a three-wheeled vehicle on a motorcycle licence required passing a full motorcycle test and completing a restriction period. When the licence was issued it included a B1 class. This conferred the right to drive a vehicle with three or four wheels up to 550kg, but the final B1 licences were issued in 2001. In January 2013, the licensing changed again. Drivers with a full A-category motorcycle licence who are over 21 years of age may drive a three-wheeled vehicle of any weight. The age restriction of 21 applies to full car licence holders also in the UK. Driving any Reliant three-wheeled vehicle is not legal on a CBT licence or lower.",Normal
"The Viale Giotto 120 Building collapse was a deadly accident which occurred in Foggia, Italy in the early morning of November 11, 1999. The building was an apartment complex with 26 flats, at the time less than 30 years old. 71 people lived in the building; 67 people were killed. The six-story apartment building, located in the southern outskirts of Foggia, suffered a structural failure and imploded with few immediate warning signs: the whole collapse, registered by the seismographs of the Specola Nigri Institute, lasted only 19 seconds. First reports from the rescuers stated that 80 people could be buried under the rubble. The first responders succeeded in saving nine survivors, most of whom resided on the top floors. One family, who had heard strange noises and tried to alert the property manager and the neighbours, escaped the building shortly before the final collapse and was found shocked but in good shape. Due to the likely presence of people under the rubble, excavators could not help the rescue. Vigili del Fuoco, volunteers and townspeople worked all night long to remove the debris, aided by search dogs and geophones. A fire broke out in the cellars of the building, where some mattresses were stored. Thick smoke covered the stricken area, impairing rescue operations and probably killing some of the survivors still under the debris. Autopsies later found that most of the victims died of asphyxia within the first two minutes of the collapse, from a combination of both dust and smoke. The last survivor was recovered around 11 pm on November 11, while dozens of bodies were still under the rubble. Two days later a public mass was held in the city fairgrounds, where the bodies were stored. A number of suppositions were advanced for the failure. Early speculations about a gas explosion were quickly dismissed. One focus was on enlargement of the underground car parking - it was supposed that some main pillars were cut or removed by the builders combined with heavy rains of the previous days, and the geological conditions of the land under the building, rendered the structure unsafe. Some victims' relatives said that since the previous August some ""squeaks"" and noises had been reported in the structure, and misalignment of doors and windows was becoming a common concern. The first reports of potential structural concerns dated back to two full years before the tragedy, and were followed by a technical survey, leading to no remarks. The final cause was determined to be poor workmanship and materials of the original build. The building was erected during the economic boom, a period where Italy experienced fast growth of cities and industries, and the rebuilding after World War II was still going on. The enormous demand for new houses led inexperienced builders to the business, and prompted them to cut corners on material quality and reinforcement techniques, to cut cost and increase margins in order to remain competitive. The legacy of those practices is still a source of problems, and was a major cause of death in the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake. The builders were brothers Delli Carri, who lived in a penthouse at the top floor. Both died in the tragedy. The engineer who designed the structures, Mr. Inglese, died a few years before the collapse. The inquiry was officially closed on March 21, 2007, and confirmed that the causes were to be found exclusively in the poor building materials used for the structural cage. People in Foggia developed a strong civic feeling in the days after the tragedy. President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi visited the city, and at their request met with victims' relatives. He later spoke to the press. The disaster led to modifications in laws requiring assessment of old buildings and new guarantees for new ones. The total body count was of 67 deceased. A monument was placed in the Foggia graveyard to remember the tragedy, and on the 10th anniversary a square was dedicated to the victims.",Normal

"The International Free Press Society (IFPS), founded on 1 January 2009, is a creation of the Danish Free Press Society. The stated purpose of IFPS ""is to defend freedom of expression wherever and by whomever it is threatened"". It has been described as a key component of the counterjihad movement and said to be an instrument for pushing the boundaries of hate speech by the executive director of the Institute of Race Relations. The IFPS was created as an extension of the Danish Free Press Society, created in 2004 by Lars Hedegaard, a Danish newspaper commentator. According to its own account, the Free Press Society arose because of increasing pressure on free speech, including the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoon crisis. The Free Press Society claims to be ""Denmark's biggest organisation exclusively devoted to defending the right of free expression."" The society is considered a key component of the counterjihad movement and in the article The Muslim Conspiracy and the Oslo Massacre Liz Fekete, the executive director of the independent educational charity named Institute of Race Relations, argues that it is an instrument for pushing the boundaries of hate speech. The International Free Press Society has contact with a range of international critics of Islam who argue that islamisation threatens Freedom of Speech, including Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Ibn Warraq, Daniel Pipes, Geert Wilders, Bruce Bawer and Henryk Broder. It also relays information from other sources, amongst which are the blogs Gates of Vienna and Jihad Watch, which have been characterised as islamophobic. The Danish Free Press Society, among others, awarded Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard the Sappho Award, an award given to a 'journalist who combines excellence in his work with courage and a refusal to compromise'. His editor Flemming Rose is another recipient. As culture editor of Jyllands-Posten he commissioned the Muhammad cartoons, a move that resulted in the chief editor sending him on leave. On 22 December 2009 the Chairman of the Danish Free Press Society, and then member of the Danish People's Party, Lars Hedegaard, gave an interview in which he declared that Muslims ""rape their own children. It is heard of all the time. Girls in Muslim families are raped by their uncles, their cousins or their fathers."" He also stated that ""Whenever it is prudent for a Muslim to hide his true intentions by lying or making a false oath in his own or in Islam’s service, then it is ok to do it."" Søren Krarup a fellow party member, said that Hedegaard's remarks were justified, though they could have been more ""carefully"" stated. He instead blamed the controversy on a ""media mafia"" whom he accused of distorting Hedegaard's statements. Søren Espersen defended Hedegaard's remarks. Others were more critical, and Hedegaard's interview led to the immediate resignation of three Free Press Society board members: Liberal Party MP Søren Pind the Conservative Party's Integration spokesman Naser Khader and the Lutheran priest Kathrine Lilleør. Vicechairman in the Integration Council in Aarhus Municipality Yilmaz Evcil reported Lars Hedegaard to the police, and the public attorney chose to make a case against him for violating the Danish anti-racism laws. His trial began 24 January 2011. He was acquitted of all charges on 31 January 2011; however, the Eastern Regional Court reversed the acquittal in May 2011. He appealed against the verdict, and in 2012, the Supreme Court acquitted him in a 7-0 decision. The ""Board of Directors"" includes Lars Hedegaard, Diana West, Paul Beliën (editor of The Brussels Journal), Christine Brim, Bjørn Larsen and Edward S. May (editor of Gates of Vienna). It has national branches in such countries as the United Kingdom, where Paul Weston is or was the President of the English branch.

"The Basil Brush Show is a British children's television sitcom series, starring the glove puppet fox Basil Brush. It was produced for six series by The Foundation, airing on CBBC from 27 September 2002 to 25 December 2007. The show is a spin-off from the original 1960s–1970s BBC television series, but without any of the original cast. The series is set in a colourful modern penthouse flat, which is jointly owned by Basil and his sidekick, Stephen (Christopher Pizzey). Living with them are Stephen's niece and nephew, Molly (Georgina Leonidas), and Dave (Michael Hayes). They are left under the care of Stephen so that Molly & Dave's parents can go on a round the world trip. Other characters include Anil (Ajay Chabra), the owner of a greasy-spoon café under the name of 'Anil's', where the main characters would frequently be seen dining. Ella (Tisha Martin) is Basil and Stephen's neighbour who loves to sing. She is later replaced by Maddison (Laura Evans), an American fashion designer. In Series 1, Laurie Ventry appeared in 12 out of the 13 episodes, playing a different character every time. Notably, the series takes a laissez-faire attitude towards the show's atmosphere, and the fourth wall is frequently broken; characters often reference the fact that they are on a studio set, and several episodes feature scenes and segments where the show's cameramen and crew become involved in the storyline. As the show was re-vamped in later years, two other characters were introduced. Liam (Michael Byers) replaces Stephen as Basil's new sidekick, with Lucy (Janine Vieira - Series 5 & Madeline Castrey - Series 6) debuting as Anil's niece. Basil Brush is a red fox, rendered as both a glove puppet and an animated character. Stephen (usually referred to by Basil as ""Mr Stephen"") is the uncle to Dave and Molly, and is left in charge of them when their parents go on a round-the-world tour. He was on the show from 2002 to 2006. He is often the main subject of Basil's or another character's jokes, much to his annoyance. He was also not very clever as he did not seem to know a very simple sum (as established in the episode ""Bing Trouble"", when Molly told him that 2 + 2 = 4 to which he said ""Does it?""). He was played by Christopher Pizzey and left at the end of series 4. He appeared briefly in series 5 when Basil mentioned that he has been snapped up by Hollywood. But this later reveals he is working at a Hollywood burger van. His cousin Liam arrives shortly after to take his place. Liam is played by Michael Byers and is a distant cousin of Stephen's, replacing him as Basil's sidekick in the fifth series of the show, appearing from 2006 to 2007. Liam is trying to come to terms with the exciting things which are yet to happen to him in life. He can appear slightly dumb in some aspects, but is actually quite smart. Several episodes revolve around some of his near-impossible inventions (like a time machine and a shrink ray) and he is also good at chemistry. A recurring joke is that he will mention some odd night class he has been to, with the line, ""I knew those (-whatever is relevant to the story-) night classes would come in handy."" In the episode Ballroom Basil, it is stated that his surname is O'Dingleberry. Dave is a child character who is 10 years old in Series 1, growing to be 15 in Series 6. He is regularly shown to have a flair for business and has, throughout the course of the series, set up a media empire which was later destroyed by Basil and Stephen in the episode Meeja Mogul, imported stolen goods and even started his own television show. He is usually addressed as a 14-year-old multi-billionaire entrepreneur and is played by Michael Hayes. Molly is Dave's older sister and Stephen's niece. She is 12 years old in series 1 and 17 in series 6. She is portrayed as the sensible character, trying to reason with the characters whenever they make a bad decision and can sometimes be very violent. Molly is one of the most popular characters on the show. She is very clever and very witty. From Series 5, Molly appears in only a few episodes as a recurring character, with Lucy partially replacing her character-type. Molly only appears in two episodes in the final season, in Ballroom Basil where she says she is going to get some milk and she may be gone for some time, and in Basil Christmas Dinners where she returns and explains there was a worldwide milk shortage and she had to go all the way to Timbuktu which is why she was so long. She is portrayed by Georgina Leonidas. An American who was introduced as 'Madison Square-Gardens', Madison is a fashion student living in the flat upstairs. She was on the show from 2004 to 2007. The character of Madison is played by Laura Evans, a singersongwriter from Aberdare in South Wales. Her initial designs were thrown out by Basil, having mistaken them for rubbish. Madison is Stephen's third love interest in the show. She pronounces Basil's name in the southern US way, as Bay-zull. When things start going wrong, she often protests that the only reason she is still in the UK is because she has lost her passport. Her name comes from Madison Square Garden. Appearing in every series of the show, Anil is the owner of Basil's local hangout, Anil's Caff. Like Mr Stephen, he is shown to have a less than average intelligence, and a running joke through the series is the terrible quality of his food. It is revealed that he is sexist in Bend it like Basil. He is played by Ajay Chabra. In the episode Camping it is revealed that Anil wears a wig, has a glass eye, false teeth and a prosthetic wooden leg. Lucy is Anil's niece and currently lives in Basil's flat. Lucy was Anil's ""slave"" but was ""rescued"" by Madison. She can be quite stubborn at times but loves hanging out in the flat with Basil and the rest of the gang. She hates cousin Mortimer's pranks and Dave's cons. Lucy replaces Molly after she left the show after series 4, and aired on the show from 2006 to 2007. The character of Lucy is played by Janine Vieira in Season 5 and Madeline Castrey in Season 6. Ella is Stephen's second love interest, only appearing in the second series (2003). She is also good friends with Molly. It is revealed that she is a football prodigy in Bend it like Basil. She is played by Tisha Martin. The Voice Over Man was an unseen character who often voiced over at times when he annoys the gang but occasionally he undid some mistakes that Basil and his friends made. He was part of the regular cast from 2002 to 2005, quietly retiring from the show after Series 4. He was credited as Basil Soper. Mortimer is Basil's cousin and recurring antagonist. In the first series finale, he arrived and pretended to be kind and helpful to the local people but secretly he was stealing things and getting Basil into trouble. In the second series, he was released from prison and he was still causing havoc. His catchphrase is ""Bang! Bang!"", followed by the sound of two projectile ricochets. In the third series he and Basil had to get along for 24 hours without fighting and arguing but they over-wound the wind-up clock and they fought one minute too early . He also appeared at Basil's wedding when he was marrying evil Kelly Foxwell but in the end, Kelly liked Mortimer more than Basil. He returned in the Christmas special. He appeared in the fourth series in prison. He is voiced by Don Austen. He appeared in the 2005 and 2006 Christmas specials. In the first series finale, his full name is revealed to be Mortimer Trouble Brush. Basil's playful and hyperactive nephew fox cub. Often says ""Bing bing!"". Bingo has a twin brother called Bungo whom Basil says is ""much, much worse"", who only appeared at the end of Bingo's first story. Bingo appeared on the show multiple occasions, starting from 2003. Bingo is voiced by Don Austen. Roxy is Basil's girlfriend, but unlike the other foxes in the show she is an Arctic fox. She has only been seen in four episodes of the fifth series (2006), including the 2006 Christmas Special. She pronounces Basil's name as Ba-Zeal. She is voiced by Sheila Clark. Mr Rossiter is the landlord who own the flats the main characters live in. He is named after Leonard Rossiter, who famously played the landlord Rupert Rigsby in the sitcom Rising Damp. He is played by Milton Johns. India is a waitress who works at Anil's Cafe (Basil's local hangout). She is a terrible cook like her boss but has a beautiful singing voice, as shown to perform songs occasionally throughout the series. India was only mentioned for a brief portion of the final season (2007). She is played by India de Beaufort. Amanda first appeared in the first episode in Season 1. She is a restaurant critic and Stephen's first love interest. In the series 1 finale, Amanda sides with Mortimer when he takes over the show and turning it into a seedy backdrop. She dresses up as a club harlot and breaks the fourth wall, claiming she ""can't afford to be out of work"". When Stephen orders her to ""get those cloths off!"", she indignantly leaves and is never seen again. She is played by Jodie Scott. Basil's Swap Shop is a remake of the cult-classic children's Saturday morning show, Multicoloured Swap Shop. The show was presented by Basil Brush and Barney Harwood and was produced for three series by the Foundation (the same production company that produced the Basil Brush Show) and aired live from 5 January 2008 to 25 September 2010 on BBC Two and the CBBC Channel. Basil's Game Show was the cut-down version of the show that featured just the games, as well as some of the comedy segments. Right Entertainment and Universal Pictures Video released several DVD sets in the United Kingdom. A selection of episodes have been released on DVD by ABC VideoRoadshow Entertainment and Universal Pictures Australia. In the United Kingdom, the show previously aired on CBBC. The show has aired on Boomerang in Brazil as O Show do Basil. The show has aired on Cartoon Network and La 2 in Spain as El Show de Basil Brush. The show has aired on RTP2 in Portugal in English with Portuguese subtitles.",Normal
"Talbot Merton Smith (born September 27, 1933) is an American former professional baseball executive who has served in high baseball operations positions—including general manager and club president—as well as the founder of a firm that advises Major League Baseball teams on salary arbitration cases. A veteran of 54 years in baseball, he most recently served as president of baseball operations for the Houston Astros from November 22, 1994, through November 27, 2011—completing his 35th season with the Astros over three separate terms; he received a lifetime achievement award in 2005. He is the father of baseball executive Randy Smith. Tal Smith was born in Framingham, Massachusetts. After attending Culver Military Academy and Duke University, serving in the United States Air Force, and a brief time as a sportswriter, he began his baseball career in the front office of the Cincinnati Reds as a protégé of Gabe Paul, their general manager from 1951–1960. He moved with Paul to Houston when the Astros were founded (as the Colt .45s) at the close of the 1960 baseball campaign. While Paul stayed only a few months in Texas before resigning to return to Ohio as front-office boss of the Cleveland Indians, Smith remained with Houston as the team's farm system director, then assistant to the president. He was promoted to vice president, player personnel after the 1965 season. When Paul surfaced as a member of George Steinbrenner's syndicate, which purchased the New York Yankees early in 1973, he hired Smith away from the Astros as executive vice president and head of the Yankees' baseball operations department. Smith spent 2+1⁄2 seasons as a key part of the management team that built the Yankees back into a league power. But when the chance came to become the general manager of the Astros on August 7, 1975, Smith accepted it. Houston was in last place in the National League West Division when Smith assumed the reins, but under his leadership, the team rebuilt itself into contenders, winning its first division title in 1980. Along the way, Smith was named team president in 1976 and played a key role in resolving the club's ownership problem when he helped to convince Dr. John McMullen, a limited partner in Steinbrenner's ownership group, to sell his Yankees' shares and become the owner of the Astros. However, in a move that shocked baseball, McMullen fired Smith only days after the team's successful 1980 season; McMullen went so far as to call Smith a ""despicable human being"". The move angered fans and partners. In fact, some of the Astros limited partners threatened a lawsuit and brought about a re-organization with the result that two other directors ended up on equal footing with McMullen. The Astros made the playoffs in 1981 before experiencing a slide that did not end until 1986. Rather than seeking another front-office job, Smith formed his own consulting firm named Tal Smith Enterprises to advise MLB clubs on how best to handle salary arbitration cases with their players. His firm became extremely successful over the next 15 years. In November 1994, Smith returned to the Astros (under the club's then-owner Drayton McLane, Jr.) as president of business operations. On August 27, 2007, Smith was named acting GM after the firing of Tim Purpura. He re-assumed his previous position upon the appointment of Ed Wade as full-time GM on September 21, 2007. Both Wade and Smith were dismissed by the team's new owner, Houston businessman Jim Crane, when he assumed control of the Astros late in November 2011. According to news reports at the time, Smith still heads Tal Smith Enterprises. Smith was a vital aide to McLane in the design of the Astros' ballpark, Minute Maid Park. The ballpark's field dimensions and unique angles were designed with Smith's input and assistance. Until the 2017 season, center field included a 30-degree hill named ""Tal's Hill"" as a tribute to his creativity and contribution to the Minute Maid Park project. Smith had a similar role in the construction of the Astros' first stadium, the Astrodome, in 1963 when he was assistant to the president of the Houston Sports Association. The Astrodome changed the face of stadiums and the city of Houston. When natural grass failed to thrive under the Astrodome's roof, Smith was responsible for finding an alternative playing surface. This led to the installation of Astroturf, a synthetic turf that became widely used in stadiums throughout the country.

Bangladesh is represented in Vienna by the Permanent Mission of Bangladesh to the United Nations in Vienna. Bangladesh has been unanimously elected a member of the UN Commission on the Status of Women for a four-year term from 2024 to 2028. The United Nations and its agencies bought relief to Bangladesh in 1971 during the Bangladesh Liberation war. The UN provided aid to Bangladeshi refugees of the war. During the 26th session of the General Assembly of the United Nation, the Provincial government of Bangladesh sent an envoy to United Nations on 21 September 1971. In October 1971, a Bangladeshi representative spoke at the UN Plaza and declared the ""point of no return"" had been reached in the Bangladesh Liberation war against Humanity. Bangladesh had the first official delegate to the UN on 4 December 1971. The World Health Organization, UNICEF, and World Food Program provided aid to the refugees.

The operation was headed by John R Kelly at the beginning and later he was replaced by Paul Mckee Henry. On 16 November 1971, the operation was completely taken over by the United Nations from the civil administration of East Pakistan due to mismanagement. This harmed the morale of civil servants in the East Pakistan administration. After the Independence of Bangladesh on 16 December 1971, the United Nations created United Nations Relief Operations in Dhaka (UNROD) on 21 December 1971 and was managed by Robert Jackson, which was upgraded to United Nations Relief Operations in Bangladesh (UNROB).

"Éloi Machoro (January 1949 – 12 January 1985) was a New Caledonian Kanak separatist politician. Machoro was born in Nakety in January 1949. He held several jobs, including clerk, farm worker, miner and a teacher in a primary school. After being elected assistant general secretary of the Caledonian Union in 1977, he contested the East constituency in the elections that year and was elected to the Territorial Assembly, and was re-elected in 1979 when the party ran as part of the Independence Front. Following the assassination of Pierre Declercq on 19 September 1981, Machoro became the party's general secretary. He and other separatist militants went to Libya. The Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS) was formed in September 1984 as a replacement for the Independence Front, boycotting the elections in November. On 1 December Jean-Marie Tjibaou declared the formation of a provisional government of Kanak Socialist Republic, with Machoro as Minister of Security. As a result, he became the leader of the independents' armed forces. He disarmed the gendarmes of Thio, and gained control over the village without violence. On 11 January 1985 Yves Tual, the son of a European stockbreeder, was killed by independentist militants at La Foa. These events triggered a series of nighttime rebellions. On 12 January, the gendarmes started an operation to free the house of a European in Canala that the FLNKS had occupied under the leadership of Machoro. The FLNKS occupants eventually fled to a farmhouse, where the gendarmes caught them. Machoro and Marcel Nonaro were killed during the ensuing action. The gendarmes left Machoro in pain for hours to die without giving him help.",Normal

"Religious satire is a form of satire that refers to religious beliefs and can take the form of texts, plays, films, and parody. From the earliest times, at least since the plays of Aristophanes, religion has been one of the three primary topics of literary satire, along with politics and sex. Satire which targets the clergy is a type of political satire, while religious satire is that which targets religious beliefs. Religious satire is also sometimes called philosophical satire, and is thought to be the result of agnosticism or atheism. Notable works of religious satire surfaced during the Renaissance, with works by Geoffrey Chaucer, Erasmus and Albrecht Dürer. Religious satire has been criticised and at times censored to avoid offence, for example the film Life of Brian was initially banned in Ireland, Norway, some states of the US, and some towns and councils of the United Kingdom. This potential for censorship often leads to debates on the issue of freedom of speech such as in the case of the Religious Hatred Bill in January 2006. Critics of the original version of the Bill (such as comedian Rowan Atkinson) feared that satirists could be prosecuted. Religious satire has been criticised by those who feel that sincerely held religious views should not be subject to ridicule. In some cases religious satire has been censored – for example, Molière's play Tartuffe was banned in 1664. The film Life of Brian was initially banned in Ireland, Norway, some states of the US, and some towns and councils of the United Kingdom. In an interesting case of life mirroring art, activist groups who protested the film during its release bore striking similarities to some bands of religious zealots within the film itself. Like much religious satire, the intent of the film has been misinterpreted and distorted by protesters. According to the Pythons, Life of Brian is not a critique of religion so much as an indictment of the hysteria and bureaucratic excess that often surrounds it. The issue of freedom of speech was hotly debated by the UK Parliament during the passing of the Religious Hatred Bill in January 2006. Critics of the original version of the Bill (such as comedian Rowan Atkinson) feared that satirists could be prosecuted, but an amendment by the House of Lords making it clear that this was not the case was passed – by just one vote. In 2006, Rachel Bevilacqua, a member of the Church of the SubGenius, known as Rev. Magdalen in the SubGenius hierarchy, lost custody and contact with her son after a district court judge took offense at her participation in the Church's X-Day festival. ...religion, politics, and sexuality are the primary stuff of literary satire. Among these sacret targets, matters costive and defecatory play an important part. ... from the earliest times, satirists have used scatological and bathroom humor. Aristophanes, always livid and nearly scandalous in his religious, political, and sexual references... ...classifying the very topics his satirists satirized: housing, food, and fuel supplies, poverty, inflation, ""hooliganism"", public services, religion, stereotypes of nationals (the Englishman, German, &c), &c. Yet the truth of the matter is that no satirist worth his salt (Petronius, Chaucer, Rabelais, Swift, Leskov, Grass) ever avoids man's habits and living standards, or scants those delicate desiderata: religion, politics, and sex.",Normal
"Wrist drop is a medical condition in which the wrist and the fingers cannot extend at the metacarpophalangeal joints. The wrist remains partially flexed due to an opposing action of flexor muscles of the forearm. As a result, the extensor muscles in the posterior compartment remain paralyzed. The forearm is the part of the body that extends from the elbow to the wrist and is not to be confused with the arm, which extends from the shoulder to the elbow. The extensor muscles in the forearm are the extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor digiti minimi, extensor digitorum, extensor indicis, extensor carpi radialis brevis, and extensor carpi radialis longus. These extensor muscles are supplied by the posterior interosseous nerve, a branch of the radial nerve. Other muscles in the forearm that are innervated by this nerve are the supinator, extensor pollicis brevis, extensor pollicis longus and abductor pollicis longus. All of these muscles are situated in the posterior half of the forearm (posterior is when it is in its standard anatomical position). Also, the brachioradialis, anconeus, triceps brachii and extensor carpi radialis longus are all innervated by muscular branches of the radial nerve in the arm. Wrist extension is achieved by muscles in the forearm contracting, pulling on tendons that attach distal to (beyond) the wrist. If the tendons, muscles, or nerves supplying these muscles are damaged or otherwise not working as they should be, wrist drop may occur. The following situations may result in wrist drop: Types of wrist drop are distinguished by the nerves affected: The workup for wrist drop frequently includes nerve conduction velocity studies to isolate and confirm the radial nerve as the source of the problem. Other screening tests include the inability to extend the thumb into a ""hitchhiker's sign"". Plain films can help identify bone spurs and fractures that may have injured the nerve. Sometimes MRI imaging is required to differentiate subtle causes. Initial treatment includes splinting of the wrist for support, along with osteopathic medicine, physiotherapy and occupational therapy. In some cases, surgical removal of bone spurs or other anatomical defects that may be impinging on the nerve might be warranted. If the injury was the result of pressure from prolonged use of improperly fitted crutches or other similar mechanisms of injury, then the symptoms of wrist drop will most likely resolve spontaneously within 8–12 weeks.",Normal

"Environmental Defence (formerly known as the Canadian Environmental Defence Fund) is a Canadian environmental organization, founded in 1984. Its areas of education and research include toxic chemicals, urban sprawl, oil sands, global warming, water quality, and endangered species. The organization was founded in 1984. Environmental Defence was part of the founding of the Green Energy Act Alliance. The Green Energy and Economy Act, a first for North America, went into law in Ontario in 2009, and outlined a strategy to improve conservation, increase renewable energy generation, and create green jobs. The Act formed part of the Ontario government's plan to put the province on a path towards reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, while becoming a leader in the emerging global renewable energy sector. In its 2018 annual report, Environmental Defence stated that, during the year prior, it had raised over C$3.8 million. Environmental Defence has a number of different areas of focus, including the following: In 2008, Environmental Defence and The Workgroup for Safe Markets in the US commissioned a report, researched by a lab at the University of Missouri, which stated that plastic baby bottles from a number of manufacturers, including Avent, Evenflo, Dr. Brown's and DisneyFirst Years, were leaching unsafe levels of bisphenol A (BPA) when heated. This led to dozens of state and national environmental health organizations in Canada and the United States calling for an immediate moratorium on the use of BPA in baby bottles, and other food and beverage containers. In 2017, Environmental Defence and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) released a report showing how tar sands mining operations in Alberta generated over 250 billion gallons of toxic tailings – a poisonous mixture of water, sand, silt, heavy metals, and other petrochemical waste products – have been stored in toxic lakes that cover an area greater than Manhattan and Boston combined. The NRDC noted that research by the Canadian federal government has determined that toxic tailings are seeping into groundwater and the Athabasca River.

"The Promise of World Peace is a document produced by the Universal House of Justice of the Baháʼí Faith in October 1985, on the occasion of the International Year of Peace. It outlines the major prerequisites for, as well as the obstacles working against, the establishment of world peace. As of January 1988 the peace statement had been presented to 198 heads of state, 75 directly and 123 indirectly. The statement had been translated into 76 languages and an estimated one to two million copies disseminated to people around the world. Some specifics by country were listed in 9 pages of the February 1988 issue of the Baháʼí News. In the document, the Universal House of Justice asserts that world peace is not only possible but inevitable, and it is now within reach for the first time in human history. It states, however, that the current international system of governance is flawed and is unable to eradicate the threats of war, terrorism, anarchy and economic instability. Adding to the problem is the widespread belief that human beings are intrinsically hostile and aggressive, and that these flaws make long-term global peace and stability unsustainable. The statement presents a contrary argument that the human race has been developing and maturing through its history, that human beings are fundamentally spiritual in nature and are the creation of God. As a result, they are capable of building civilization and creating a peaceful world if they decide to do so. The Universal House of Justice asserts that peace cannot occur without religion and quotes Bahaʼu'lláh, the founder of the Bahaʼi Faith. “Religion is the greatest of all means for the establishment of order in the world and the peaceful contentment of all that dwell therein.” It is the Universal House of Justice's contention that source of religious strife does not lie with the different religions themselves, but rather with the negligence of humanity and the, “imposition of erroneous interpretations"". These interpretations have separated faith from reason and science from religion. Having rejected religion as irrelevant, societies around the world have adopted a wide number of ideologies that have failed to serve and support the interests of humanity as a whole. Peace cannot be achieved simply by banning particular weapons, resolving specific conflicts or by signing new treaties. It requires a whole new level of commitment. The statement asserts that a new framework must be adopted based on several overarching principles and a genuine interest in creating a peaceful and just world. The underlying problems that must be addressed include: The Universal House of Justice goes on to say that peace must be founded on the understanding that mankind is essentially one human family. It then calls for the leaders of the world to gather and deliberate on the problem, for the full support of the United Nations and the willing assent of all people for that process of deliberation.",Normal
"Mono No Aware is a compilation album of ambient songs by various artists, released by the Berlin-based record label PAN. Titled after the Japanese term of the same name, meaning ""the pathos of things"" or ""an empathy towards things"", Mono No Aware features previously unreleased tracks by artists under the PAN label, including Yves Tumor and Jeff Witscher. Mono No Aware was first released on vinyl record as a ""special art edition"" at the Los Angeles Art Book Fair in February 2017, limited to 100 copies. The album later received a general release on physical and digital media on 17 March 2017. Mark Richardson of Pitchfork gave the album a positive review, writing that ""Each piece of the 80-minute compilation has its own unique identity, yet together it feels like the work of one mind."" Crack Magazine's Tom Watson, in his review of the album, wrote that, ""Often, mono no aware achieves something transcendental with music that is hypnotic, diverse and tenebrous but clearly forged by the sensitive hands of humans""; Watson concludes by calling it ""a Spirograph of uniquely experimental artists merging together to create something even more beguiling. A truly arresting listen."" Jake Witz of NPR praised Yves Tumor's track ""Limerence"", calling it ""a heartbreaking look at how mono no aware transpires within the context of a romantic relationship."" Witz commended the track's use of audio samples of romantic partners in a home video as ""a haunting ceremony"", and wrote that, ""mono no aware is painful, but only if you see the past and present as disconnected worlds. By fusing decayed recordings with modern ambience, ""Limerence"" transforms death from a negative experience into a universal bond of empathy.""",Normal

"Super CR3W (pronounced ""Super Crew"") is a male assemblage of hip-hop dancers originating from Las Vegas, Nevada. The group won the second season Americas Best Dance Crew in the finals. Contrary to popular belief, Super CR3W was formed long before their appearance on Americas's Best Dance Crew, specifically in 2000. They wanted to bring the dance style, ""BreakdancingB-Boying"" to the world. Super Cr3w (pronounced ""Super Crew"" and also spelled ""Super CR3W"") is a breakdance crew from Las Vegas, Nevada who won the 2nd season of America's Best Dance Crew. Before their popularity on ABDC, Super Cr3w was formed from three different b-boy dance crews (all from the west) and formed a ""Super Crew"" of their own. The Jabbawockeez and Super CR3W have a unique history together. Cristyle, a member of the Jabbawockeez, is also a member of ""Full Force Crew"" with original ""Super CR3W"" member Ronnieboy before their ABDC wins. And in recent years, fellow Jabbawockeez member Kid Rainen, had joined ""Full Force"", later adding ""Super CR3W"" members Do-Knock, Vex, & Rockadile to the crew. In May 2010, Jabbawockeez had their own show at the MGM Grand in Vegas and asked Ronnie, Do-Knock, Ben, and Rock from Super Cr3w to perform with them. Super Cr3w dressed up in masks and danced with the Jabbawockeez. The connection between the two crews is so strong that they often call themselves the ""Super Wockeez"" when they are together. Super Cr3w became America's Best Dance Crew's season two champions in August 2008. Aired on June 7, 2008, Super CR3W was introduced to audiences through a series of questions by judges JC Chasez, Shane Sparks and Lil Mama. JC Chasez asked to hear more about the ""very accomplished B-boys"" in the crew, to which Do-Knock replied about having ""some nasty cats"" on his squad, stating members' individual accomplishments such as Ronnie's 2007 Red Bull BC One championship, Murda and Ben's two-time Battle of the Year wins, and his own Star Search win. Each crew performed to songs of their own choosing. Super CR3W selected the song ""Get Up Offa That Thing"" by James Brown and performed in Ninja costumes. Accordingly, their dance moves were Ninja-influenced. Super CR3W was in the bottom 5, but after their performance to ""Get Up Offa That Thing"", Super CR3W's fanbase quickly grew and Super Cr3w became one of the top contenders. Taboo from The Black Eyed Peas was seen during this episode holding up the Super CR3W hand sign right after their performance. Each crew was given a different video with a dance sequence in it, which they had to perform while keeping their own style as a crew. Super CR3W was given the music video for ""Run It!"" by Chris Brown. They used the element of krumping from the video and mixed it in with B-boy moves such as the deuce deuce. JC Chasez said afterward that he saw more tricks than dancing and would like to see actual dance moves incorporated into their next performance, to which Shane Sparks countered to by saying break dancing and tricks is dancing. Each crew was given a song whose title was used as inspiration for their dance. Super CR3W received the song ""We Fly High"" by Jim Jones. As part of the challenge, they dressed in Clark Kent uniforms and performed ""flying"" moves such as Ben's air flare and the crew's airplane transformation. The judges, especially Shane Sparks, were ecstatic with Super CR3W's performance, complimenting the crew's ability to complete the challenge they were given. Chris Gatdula, member of The Jabbawockeez, Super CR3W and Full Force, from season 1 of America's Best Dance Crew were seen wearing Super CR3W's T-shirts and cheering for them. Crews must transition from a slow song to a faster one while still remaining on beat. Super CR3W chose the song “Creator” by Santogold. Jon Cruz dressed as a graffiti artist while the rest of the crew were painted gold to replicate gold statues. For the challenge, the crew used the 6-step B-boy move at an incrementing speed to transition from slow to fast. Each crew was given a Janet Jackson song and had to incorporate some of her moves into their dance, similar to the Michael Jackson challenge of Season 1. Super CR3W received Black Cat by Janet Jackson. For the first time ever, Super CR3W was in the bottom two against A.S.I.I.D. However, Super Cr3w managed to beat A.S.I.I.D and remain in the competition. Shane Sparks told Super Cr3w that ""they're finally back!"" Each crew was given a song and a school subject to use as the theme for this week's prop-oriented dance routines. Super CR3W was given the song ""Don't Touch Me"" by Busta Rhymes and the subject of basketball. For the second time in the show (and in a row), they were in the bottom two, this time against Supreme Soul, but once again they were saved from elimination. Each crew was given a song by Missy Elliott and had to adapt the videos' innovative footwork to showcase their own style. Super CR3W was given the song ""We Run This"" by Missy Elliott They were not in the bottom 2 this time. All three judges gave them praise and positive feedback, and guest judge Missy Elliott claimed Super CR3W's choreography was so hot, they made her video ""look wack"" as a compliment to show how great their performance was. Using the songs Bust A Move by Young MC, Humpty Dance by Digital Underground and Word Up by Cameo, Super CR3W had to create a routine using a dance from the 80s. Like the ""Dance Craze Challenge"" from Season 1, crews were given a physical challenge to complete during their routine. Super CR3W had to perform the Humpty Dance with only 4 feet on the floor. Crews must create a routine that incorporates elements of an 80s dance movie. Similar to the ""Broadway Challenge"" from Season 1, crews were given remixed versions of the songs from their respective movies. Super CR3W were given the movie Footloose. All three judges gave Super CR3W high praises for both of their amazing performances this week. World Dance Challenge Both crews had to create a 2-minute routine that had different forms of world dance such as Latin, Reggae, Punjabi dance, and African Music. The songs included ""Mas Que Nada"" by Sérgio Mendes featuring The Black Eyed Peas, ""We Be Burnin'"" by Sean Paul, ""The Anthem"" by Pitbull featuring Lil Jon, and ""Mundian to Bach Ke"" by Panjabi MC featuring Twista. Only Super Cr3w received raving reviews from the judges Both crews had to create their own dance craze and had to record their own music for it. Super Crew recorded ""S to the chest"" by Super Cr3w. Crews will create a routine that shows why they should be crowned ""America’s Best Dance Crew"". Super Cr3w performed to Give It Up or Turn It Loose by James Brown. Super Cr3w and SoReal Cru opened the show with a special performance together. SuperCr3w came out in a jacket that was half of the Philippine flag and half of the Puerto Rican flag because half the crew was Filipino the other half is Puerto Rican. All crews later came together to dance for their respective regions, and Super Cr3w teamed up with Fanny Pak and Supreme Soul to represent the west coast. A total of 39 million votes were submitted and Super Cr3w were crowned the title of America's Best Dance Crew. TV Film Big Competitions Other",Normal
"Bokays and Brickbatz is a 1925 silent short animated film featuring Krazy Kat. It is among the few films of the character to be directed by Bill Nolan who earlier worked on Felix the Cat films. The title is a play on the phrase ""bouquets and brickbats"" which is used as a section in some newspapers. Krazy wants to take a shower. However, he is being disturbed by a pesky rat. When Krazy chases the rat to the outside of the house, the rodent manages to tie a string around his tail. The rat hangs Krazy on a tree branch by his tail. After Krazy cries so much, the rat shows mock sympathy by cutting the string, causing the cat to drop. Krazy retaliates as he pounds and throws the rat onto a wall. The rat speaks and vows retribution. The rat enters a hole in the wall he was thrown on. Inside, there's a pack of other rats whom he negotiates with. Shortly, the other rats agreed as they marched out of the hole and towards Krazy's house. Krazy is still in the bathroom of his house, trying to work on the piping system. The rats gather outside the house, armed with pistols. When one of the rats lands a shot, Krazy, who is also armed with pistols, leaps out a window and goes into a chase. After gunning down a few during the run, Krazy chases the rats to a mountain. The rats, who are on top, begin rolling down boulders. Krazy, however, can dodge the rocks, and even manages to throw one back. Krazy then finds a skunk around which he momentarily hurls toward the rats. The rats are quite afraid of the skunk as they jump into a lake. Krazy is back at home, resuming to shower. As he turns on a valve, regular water comes out at first. But a few seconds later, rats also rain down, much to his surprise. This article related to a short animated film is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.
